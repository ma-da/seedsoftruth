Kuhn, with his mop of straight reddish-brown hair, cunning smile, and schoolboy looks, swore that he had no connection whatsoever with Reich military research. He told his former colleagues that he was a pure scientist, an academic who spent the war working on the chemistry of modern drugs. Samuel Goudsmit had his doubts. “Richard Kuhn’s record did not seem too clean to me,” Goudsmit recalled after the war. “As president of the German Chemical Society he had followed the Nazi cult and rites quite faithfully. He never failed to give the Hitler salute when starting his classes and to shout ‘Siegheil’ like a true Nazi leader,” Goudsmit recalled. But the Alsos leader did not have enough evidence to have Kuhn arrested, so he put him under surveillance instead. Elsewhere in Germany, CIOS chemical weapons investigators Colonel Tarr and Major Tilley had been rounding up German chemists and sending them to prisoner-of-war facilities near where the individual arrests had taken place. Starting on June 1, 1945, these chemists would now be sent to a single location—a Top Secret interrogation facility outside Frankfurt. SHAEF was moving its headquarters from Versailles to Frankfurt and was to be dissolved in mid-July. The new organization in charge of all affairs, including scientific exploitation, was the Office of Military Government for Germany (OMGUS), whose commander was Eisenhower’s deputy General Lucius D. Clay. The Allies were also reorganizing the way in which scientific intelligence was going to be collected moving forward. CIOS was transitioning into American and British components: FIAT (Field Information Agency, Technical) and BIOS (British Intelligence Objectives Sub-committee). CIOS teams would remain active while they completed open investigations. The structure that housed this new interrogation center was none other than Schloss Kransberg, or Kransberg Castle, Hermann Göring’s former Luftwaffe headquarters and the place where Albert Speer and his aide spent the night the last New Year’s Eve of the war. The Allies gave it the codename Dustbin. This medieval structure built high in the Taunus Mountains had grand rooms, hardwood floors, beautiful stone fireplaces, and shiny chandeliers. These were hardly gulag-type quarters. In terms of security classification, Dustbin was top-tier. The facility was the second-most classified interrogation center after Ashcan. Dustbin was self-contained inside its centuries-old stone walls, and, as it went at Ashcan, the prisoners here were free to roam the grounds and chat among themselves. Karl Brandt, Hitler’s doctor, organized morning gymnastics classes in the garden. Others played chess. Industrialists held lectures in the large banquet hall that Göring had once used as a casino. Speer took walks in the castle’s apple orchard, almost always alone by choice. Whereas Ashcan housed the Nazi high command, Dustbin had many Nazi scientists, doctors, and industrialists under guard. This included more than twenty chemists with IG Farben and at least six members of its board.

This included more than twenty chemists with IG Farben and at least six members of its board. Throughout the early summer of 1945, several key players in Farben’s tabun gas program were still at large. For Major Tilley, the chronology regarding how Farben first began producing nerve gas and how it transformed into wide-scale production remained a mystery until a Farben chemist named Dr. Gerhard Schrader was captured and brought to Dustbin. Schrader was the man who created the nerve agent that had been found at Raubkammer, the Robbers’ Lair. The information Schrader had was among the most sought-after classified military intelligence in the world. Tilley prepared for intense stonewalling from the Farben chemist. Instead Dr. Schrader spoke freely, offering up everything he knew, beginning with tabun’s startling discovery in the fall of 1936. Dr. Schrader had been working at an insecticide lab for IG Farben in Leverkusen, north of Cologne, for several years. By the fall of 1936, he had an important job on his hands. Weevils and leaf lice were destroying grain across Germany, and Schrader was tasked with creating a synthetic pesticide that could eradicate these tiny pests. The government had been spending thirty million reichsmarks a year on pesticides made by Farben as well as other companies. IG Farben wanted to develop an insect killer that could save money for the Reich and earn the company a monopoly on pesticides. Synthesizing organic, carbon-based compounds was trial-and-error work, Dr. Schrader told Major Tilley. It was labor-intensive and dangerous. Schrader, a family man, took excellent precautions against exposure, always working under a fume hood. Even trace amounts of the chemicals he was using had cumulative, potentially lethal effects. Schrader suffered from frequent headaches and sometimes felt short of breath. One night, while driving home after working on a new product, Schrader could barely see the road in front of him. When he pulled over to examine his eyes in the mirror, he saw that his pupils had constricted to the size of a pinhead. Over the next several days his vision grew worse. He developed a throbbing pressure in his larynx. Finally, Schrader checked himself into a hospital, where he was monitored for two weeks before being sent home and told to rest. Eight days after the respite, Schrader returned to work. He had been developing a cyanidecontaining fumigant, which he had given the code name Preparation 9/91. Picking up where he’d left off with his work, he prepared a small amount of his new substance, diluting it to 1 in 200,000 units to see", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:Operation Paperclip_cleaned.txt:99:33d6438dbe70", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 6012, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "Operation Paperclip_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/031622104X", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "Operation Paperclip_cleaned", "chunk_index": 100, "text": "a throbbing pressure in his larynx.

Picking up where he’d left off with his work, he prepared a small amount of his new substance, diluting it to 1 in 200,000 units to see if it would kill lice clinging to leaves. He was stunned when his new creation killed 100 percent of the lice. Schrader repeated the experiment for his colleagues. They all agreed that Preparation 9/91 was a hundred times more lethal than anything anyone at the Leverkusen lab had ever worked with before. Dr. Schrader sent a sample of this lethal new fumigant to Farben’s director of industrial hygiene, a man named Professor Eberhard Gross (not to be confused with Dr. Karl Gross, the Waffen-SS bacteriologist connected with the Geraberg discovery). Gross tested the substance on apes and was duly shocked by the results. After a healthy ape was injected with a tiny amount of Preparation 9/91 —just 1/10th of a milligram per kilo of body weight—the ape died in less than an hour. Next, Gross tested the substance on an ape inside an inhalation chamber. He watched this healthy ape die in sixteen minutes. Professor Gross told Dr. Schrader that his Preparation 9/91 was being sent to Berlin and that he should wait for further instruction on what action to take next. At Dustbin, Schrader told Major Tilley that when he learned his compound could kill a healthy ape through airborne contact in minutes, he became upset. His discovery was never going to be used as an insecticide, Schrader lamented. It was simply too dangerous for any warm-blooded animal or human to come into contact with. Schrader said his goal was to save money for the Reich. With the news of how powerful Preparation 9/91 was, Schrader felt he’d failed at his job. He got back to work, searching for a fumigant better suited for the task of killing weevils and leaf lice. Meanwhile, Professor Gross brought the substance to his superiors. Starting in 1935, a Reich ordinance required all new discoveries with potential military application to be reported to the War Office. The Reich’s Chemical Weapons Department began to evaluate Schrader’s Preparation 9/91 for its potential use in chemical warfare. In May 1937 Schrader was invited to Berlin to demonstrate how he’d synthesized Preparation 9/91. “Everyone was astounded,” Schrader told Tilley. This was the most promising chemical killer since the Germans invented mustard gas. Preparation 9/91 was classified Top Secret and given a code name: tabun gas.

It came from the English word “taboo,” something prohibited or forbidden. Dr. Schrader was told to produce one kilogram for the German army, which would take over tabun production on a massive scale. Schrader got a bonus of 50,000 reichsmarks (the average German worker during this time period earned 3,100 reichsmarks a year) and was told to get back to work. Farben still needed him to develop a lice-killing insecticide. With their new nerve agent tabun, Farben executives saw all kinds of business opportunities. Karl Krauch, the head of Farben’s board of directors, began working with Hermann Göring on a longerrange plan to arm Germany with chemical weapons, ones that could eventually be dropped on the enemy from airplanes. In his report to Göring, Krauch called tabun “the weapon of superior intelligence and superior scientific-technological thinking.” The beauty in the nerve agent, Krauch told Göring, was that it could be “used against the enemy’s hinterland.” Göring agreed, adding that what he liked most about chemical weapons was that they terrified people. He responded to Krauch in writing, noting that the deadly effects of nerve agents like tabun gas could wreak “psychological havoc on civilian populations, driving them crazy with fear.” On August 22, 1938, Göring named Karl Krauch his Plenipotentiary for Special Questions of Chemical Production. Farben was now positioned to build the Reich’s chemical weapons industry from the ground up. The Treaty of Versailles had forced Germany to destroy all its chemical weapons factories after World War I, which meant factories had to be secretly built. This was an enormous undertaking, now an official part of the Nazis’ secret Four Year Plan, and through Krauch IG Farben was made privy to the Reich’s war plan before war was declared. At the Dustbin interrogation center, Major Tilley asked Schrader about full-scale production. Based on the Allies’ discovery of thousands of tons of tabun bombs in the forests outside Raubkammer, Farben must have had an enormous secret production facility somewhere. Dr. Schrader said that he was not involved in full-scale production. That was the job of his colleague, Dr. Otto Ambros. Major Tilley asked Schrader to tell him more about Ambros. Schrader said that most of what Ambros did was classified but that if Major Tilley wanted to know more about what he actually did for Farben, Tilley should talk to individuals who sat on Farben’s board of directors with Ambros, either Dr. Karl Krauch or Baron Georg von Schnitzler.

Both men were interned here at Dustbin. From Krauch, Major Tilley learned quite a bit more about Ambros. That he had been in charge of technical development of chemical weapons production at Gendorf and at Dyhernfurth. That Gendorf produced mustard gas on an industrial scale, and that Dyhernfurth produced tabun. Krauch also revealed a new piece of evidence. Dyhernfurth produced a second nerve agent, one that was even more potent than tabun, called sarin. Sarin was an acronym pieced together from the names of four key persons involved in its development: Schrader and Ambros from IG Farben and, from the German army, two officers named Rüdiger and Linde. Krauch told Major Tilley that the Dyhernfurth plant had fallen into Russian hands. Karl Krauch said something else that caught Major Tilley by surprise. Before coming to Dustbin, Krauch said he had been in the hospital, where he’d been paid a visit by two American officers, one of whom was Lieutenant Colonel Tarr. “Judging from conversations I had a few months ago in the hospital with members of the USSBS [Colonel Snow] and Chemical Warfare [Colonel Tarr],” Krauch explained, “the gentlemen seemed mostly interested in sarin and tabun; they asked me for construction plans and details of fabrication. As far as I understood they intended to erect similar plants in the U.S.A. I told them to apply to Dr. Ambros and his staff at Gendorf.” Major Tilley was shocked. Lieutenant Colonel Tarr was his CIOS partner, and yet Tarr had neglected to share with him the story about visiting Krauch in the hospital. This was Tilley’s first indication that Tarr was running a separate mission for the U.S. Chemical Warfare Service, one that apparently had a different objective than the CIOS mission. The full, dramatic story was about to unfold. By June 1945, Otto Ambros had been questioned by soldiers with the Third Army numerous times. For reasons that remain obscure, no one from that division had been informed of the fact that Ambros was wanted for war crimes, or that he had served as Farben’s chief of chemical weapons production throughout Hitler’s rule. To the Third Army he was simply the “plain chemist” in the Bavarian village of Gendorf, the smiling, well-dressed businessman who supplied American soldiers with free bars of soap. At Dustbin, Major Tilley relayed this critical new information about Dr. Otto Ambros to his FIAT superiors, who in turn sent an urgent message to the Sixth Army Group, also in Gendorf,", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:Operation Paperclip_cleaned.txt:102:507be2455928", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 6015, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "Operation Paperclip_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/031622104X", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "Operation Paperclip_cleaned", "chunk_index": 103, "text": "wanted for war crimes, or that he had served as Farben’s chief of chemical weapons production throughout Hitler’s rule.

At Dustbin, Major Tilley relayed this critical new information about Dr. Otto Ambros to his FIAT superiors, who in turn sent an urgent message to the Sixth Army Group, also in Gendorf, ordering the immediate arrest of Dr. Ambros. The Sixth Army was to transport Ambros directly to Dustbin so that Major Tilley could interrogate him. A note card was placed in Ambros’s dossier. Disparate bits of information were now coming into sharp focus. “Case #21877. Dr. Otto Ambros. Rumored to have been involved in use of concentration camp personnel for testing effectiveness of new poison gases developed at Gendorf.” CROWCASS notified SHAEF, insisting that Dr. Ambros be arrested. As the plant manager at Farben’s Buna factory at Auschwitz, Otto Ambros had been linked to atrocities including mass murder and slavery. The Sixth Army Group swung into action. But when they arrived at Ambros’s home in Gendorf, arrest orders in hand, Ambros was gone. The first assumption was that Ambros had fled on his own. This proved incorrect. He had been taken away by Lieutenant Colonel Philip Tarr. Initially, the commanding officer at Dustbin found this impossible to comprehend. It was one thing for Tarr to try to interview Ambros before any other chemical warfare experts did. That kind of rivalry had been going on ever since the various scientific intelligence teams had crossed the Rhine. But why would Tarr defy orders from SHAEF to have Ambros arrested? While soldiers with the Sixth Army stood scratching their heads in Gendorf, Tarr and Ambros were actually headed to Heidelberg in a U.S. Army jeep. Their destination was an American interrogation center that was run by army intelligence officers with the Chemical Warfare Service. For days, no one at Dustbin had any idea where Tarr and Ambros had gone. Otto Ambros had a razor-sharp mind. He was cunning and congenial, sly like a fox. He almost always wore a grin. The American war crimes prosecutor Josiah DuBois described him as having a “devilish friendliness” about him. He also had a distracting, rabbitlike habit of sniffing at the air. Ambros was short and heavyset, with white hair and flat feet. He was a brilliant scientist who studied chemistry and agronomy under Nobel Prize winner Richard Willstätter, a Jew. As a chemist, Ambros had a mind that was capable of pushing science into realms previously unexplored. Few men were as important to IG Farben during the war as Otto Ambros had been.

IG Farben first began producing synthetic rubber in 1935, naming it Buna after its primary component, butadiene. In 1937 Farben presented commercial Buna on the world stage and won the gold medal at the International Expo in Paris. When Germany invaded Poland in September 1939, the Reich’s ability to import natural rubber diminished. Demand for a synthetic alternative skyrocketed, a fact Farben was well aware of in advance of Germany’s attack. Tanks needed treads, aircraft needed tires, and Farben needed to produce rubber. Hitler directed Farben to increase its Buna production further. Dr. Ambros was put in charge and saw to it that Farben opened a second and then a third Buna plant so that supply could meet demand. As the invasion of the Soviet Union was secretly conceived by the German high command, Hitler again called upon Farben’s board of directors to increase its synthetic rubber production. Farben needed to construct a massive new Buna factory. Otto Ambros was put in charge of masterminding this undertaking as well. The place chosen was Auschwitz. Once, Auschwitz was a regular town. “Ordinary people lived there, and tourists visited to see the castle, the churches, the large medieval market square, and the synagogue,” write historians Debórah Dwork and Robert Jan van Pelt. In the 1930s, visitors sent postcards from the area that read “Greetings from Auschwitz.” When, in the fall of 1940, Otto Ambros pored over maps of this region, called Upper Silesia, in search of a Buna factory site, he found what he was looking for. The production of synthetic rubber required four things: water, flat land, good railway connections, and an abundance of laborers. Auschwitz had all four. Three rivers met in Auschwitz, the Sola, the Vistula, and the Przemsza, with a water flow of 525,000 cubic feet per hour. The land was flat and sixty-five feet above the waterline, making it safe from floodwaters. The railway connections were sound. But most important was the labor issue. The concentration camp next door could provide an endless labor supply because the men were cheap and could be worked to death. For Farben, the use of slave labor could take the company to levels of economic prowess previously unexplored. First, a financial deal had to be made with the SS. Ambros was instrumental in this act. For months, before the building of the Buna factory got the go-ahead, the SS and Farben haggled over deal points. Some of the paperwork survived the war.

On November 8, 1940, the Reich’s minister of economics wrote to Farben’s board of directors, requesting that they hurry up and “settle the question regarding the site.” Otto Ambros lobbied hard for Auschwitz, and in December, “The concentration camp already existing with approximately 7000 prisoners is to be expanded,” Santo noted in his official company report. For Ambros, Farben’s arrangement with the SS regarding slave laborers remained vague; Ambros sought clarity. “It is therefore necessary to open negotiations with the Reich Leader SS [Himmler] as soon as possible in order to discuss necessary measures with him,” Ambros wrote in his official company report. The two men had a decades-old relationship; Heinrich Himmler and Otto Ambros had known one another since grade school. Ambros could make Himmler see eye-to-eye with him on the benefits that Auschwitz offered to both Farben and the SS. In fact, the SS and IG Farben needed one another. Himmler wanted Farben’s resources at Auschwitz and was eager to make the deal to supply the slaves, so SS officers hosted a dinner party for Farben’s rubber and construction experts at the Auschwitz concentration camp, inside an SS banquet hall there. During the festivities, the remaining issues were finally agreed upon. Farben would pay the SS three reichsmarks a day for each laborer they supplied, which would go into the SS treasury, not to the slaves. “On the occasion of a dinner party given for us by the management of the concentration camp, we furthermore determined all the arrangements relating to the involvement of the really excellent concentration-camp operation in support of the Buna plants,” Ambros wrote to his boss, Fritz Ter Meer, on April 12, 1941. “ Our new friendship with the SS is proving very profitable,” Ambros explained. The SS agreed to provide Farben with one thousand slave workers immediately. That number, promised Himmler, could quickly rise to thirty thousand with demand. The relationship between Farben and the SS at Auschwitz was now cemented. Otto Ambros was the key to making the Buna factory a success. With his knowledge of synthetic rubber and his managerial experience—he also ran Farben’s secret nerve gas production facilities—there was no better man than Otto Ambros for the Auschwitz job.

It was now clear to him that there was no single individual more important to Hitler’s chemical weapons program than Otto Ambros had been. Ambros was in charge of chemical weapons at Gendorf and Dyhernfurth, and he was the manager of the Buna factory at Auschwitz. From interviewing various Farben chemists held at Dustbin, Tilley had also learned that the gas used to murder millions of people at Auschwitz and other concentration camps, Zyklon B, was a Farben product. Farben owned the patent on Zyklon B, and it was sold to the Reich by an IG Farben company. In one of these interviews, Tilley asked IG Farben board member Baron Georg von Schnitzler if Otto Ambros knew that Farben chemicals were being used to murder people. When Tarr and Ambros arrived in Heidelberg, the U.S. Chemical Warfare Service had another IG Farben chemist in custody whom they wanted Ambros to work with on a classified job. The man is referred to in documents only as Herr Stumpfi. Ambros and Stumpfi were told to drive to a special metals firm located in Hanau, where they were to locate “30 or 40 drawings of silver-lined equipment.” The Chemical Warfare Service trusted Ambros to such a degree that they sent him and Stumpfi on this mission without an escort. Manufacturing tabun gas was a precise and clandestine process. The United States desperately wanted to reproduce it, but attempting to do so without Farben’s proprietary formula and its secret equipment was a potential death sentence for any chemists involved. Farben had spent millions of reichsmarks on research and development. Hundreds of concentration camp workers had died in this trial-and-error process. When the U.S. Chemical Warfare Service learned that the silver-lined equipment used to manufacture tabun gas on a large scale had been outsourced from a special metals firm called Heraus, they coveted those blueprints and plans. Dr. Ambros and Herr Stumpfi were to go to this engineering firm to locate these drawings and blueprints and bring them back to Heidelberg. The Chemical Warfare Service agents could not conduct this mission on their own because they had no idea what equipment to look for. The two Farben chemists, Ambros and Stumpfi, set off on their secret assignment. “When they arrived at the factory in Hanau, personnel of a [U.S.] CIC [Counter Intelligence Corps] group with headquarters at that time in Hanau, arrested them,” read a secret report. “When they explained their mission the CIC personnel concerned confirmed the German engineers’ statement by communication with Heidelberg and the two Germans were released.” Ambros and Stumpfi drove away. “The", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:Operation Paperclip_cleaned.txt:106:bdacdb7be504", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 6019, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "Operation Paperclip_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/031622104X", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "Operation Paperclip_cleaned", "chunk_index": 107, "text": "no idea what equipment to look for.

The Chemical Warfare Service never obtained the drawings they were looking for. But at least Tarr had Dr. Ambros under his control, or so he believed. Instead, somewhere between Ambros’s release from the Heraus engineering firm in Hanau and his return to Heidelberg, he was able to communicate to his “network of spies and informants in Gendorf.” From those sources, Ambros learned that soldiers with the U.S. Sixth Army had an order to arrest him. So instead of returning to Tarr’s custody, Ambros drove to a fancy guesthouse that IG Farben maintained outside Heidelberg called Villa Kohlhof, where a staff of Farben employees tended to his every need. Major Tilley went looking for Ambros himself and found Hitler’s chemist residing at Villa Kohlhof. Ambros told Major Tilley that he would agree to continue cooperating with the U.S. Chemical Warfare Service and the various Allied agencies that sought information from him, but only on one condition: that Tilley “secure the release of all chemical warfare personnel already detained at Dustbin.” This was a preposterous request. Tilley’s superior, Major P. M. Wilson of FIAT’s Enemy Personnel Exploitation Section, attempted to take control of the situation, ordering Ambros brought to Dustbin immediately. This was not a matter of cooperation, Wilson said. There were orders to arrest the man. Lieutenant Colonel Tarr intervened on Ambros’s behalf. He lobbied the British Ministry of Supply (the agency responsible for British chemical warfare issues) for help getting Ambros’s Dustbin colleagues released. To Tarr, extracting Ambros’s esoteric knowledge outweighed the need to hold him accountable for his crimes. But the British also flatly refused to help Tarr. The matter stalled. Lieutenant Colonel Tarr flew to Paris. That night, a telegram arrived at Dustbin, sent from Paris and purporting to be from the British Ministry of Supply. The telegram ordered the release of all Farben chemical warfare scientists at Dustbin, and was signed by a British Ministry of Supply colonel named J. T. M. Childs.

The telegram ordered the release of all Farben chemical warfare scientists at Dustbin, and was signed by a British Ministry of Supply colonel named J. T. M. Childs. Officers at Dustbin suspected that something was amiss and contacted Colonel Childs about his outrageous request. Colonel Childs swore he had neither written the memo nor signed it and accused Lieutenant Colonel Tarr of forgery. FIAT enhanced their efforts to have Dr. Ambros arrested in Heidelberg. The efforts failed. Ambros was able to evade capture by fleeing into the safety of the French zone. Double-crossing Lieutenant Colonel Tarr, Otto Ambros struck a deal with French chemical weapons experts. In exchange for information, he was given a job as plant manager at Farben’s chemical factory in Ludwigshafen. When FIAT officers at Dustbin learned what had happened, they were outraged. Ambros’s escape had been entirely preventable. “It is evident that he was not kept in custody or under house arrest,” noted Captain R. E. F. Edelsten, a British officer with the Ministry of Supply. Major P. M. Wilson saw the situation in much darker terms. Lieutenant Colonel Tarr had “taken steps to assist [Ambros] to evade arrest,” he wrote in a scathing report. Wilson was appalled by “the friendly treatment being given to this man who is suspected of war criminality.” But these were just words. Ambros was now a free man, living and working in the French zone. The relationship among Tarr, Ambros, and the U.S. Chemical Warfare Service was far from over. It was only a matter of time before an American chemical company would learn of the army’s interest in a whole new field of chemical weapons. An American chemist, Dr. Wilhelm Hirschkind, was in Germany at this same time. Dr. Hirschkind was conducting a survey of the German chemical industry for the U.S. Chemical Warfare Service while on temporary leave from the Dow Chemical Company. Dr. Hirschkind had spent several months inspecting IG Farben plants in the U.S. and British zones and now he was in Heidelberg, hoping to meet Ambros. Lieutenant Colonel Tarr reached out to Colonel Weiss, the French commander in charge of IG Farben’s chemical plant in Ludwigshafen, and a meeting was arranged. On July 28, 1945, Dr. Hirschkind met with Dr. Ambros and Lieutenant Colonel Tarr in Heidelberg. Ambros brought his wartime deputy with him to the meeting, the Farben chemist Jürgen von Klenck. It was von Klenck who, in the final months of the war, had helped Ambros destroy evidence, hide documents, and disguise the Farben factory in Gendorf so that it appeared to produce soap, not chemical weapons. Jürgen von Klenck was initially detained at Dustbin but later released. The Heidelberg meetings lasted several days.

When Dr. Wilhelm Hirschkind left, he had these words for Ambros: “I would look forward after the conclusion of the peace treaty [to] continuing our relations [in my position] as a representative of Dow.” Only later did FIAT interrogators learn about this meeting. Major Tilley’s suspicions were now confirmed. A group inside the U.S. Chemical Warfare Service, including his former partner, Lieutenant Colonel Tarr, did indeed have an ulterior motive that ran counter to the motives of CIOS, FIAT, and the United Nations War Crimes Commission. Tilley’s superior at Dustbin, Major Wilson, confirmed this dark and disturbing truth in a classified military intelligence report on the Ambros affair. “It is believed that the conflict between FIAT… and Lt-Col Tarr was due to the latter’s wish to use Ambros for industrial chemical purposes” back in the United States. All documents regarding the Ambros affair would remain classified for the next forty years, until August of 1985. That an officer of the U.S. Chemical Warfare Service, Lieutenant Colonel Tarr, had sheltered a wanted war criminal from capture in the aftermath of the German surrender was damning. That this officer was also participating in meetings with the fugitive and a representative from the Dow Chemical Company was scandalous. In 1945, the Chemical Warfare Service was also in charge of the U.S. biological weapons program, the existence of which remained secret from the American public. The program was robust; if the atomic bomb failed to end the war in Japan, there were plans in motion to wage biological warfare against Japanese crops. After the fall of the Reich, the staff of the Chemical Warfare Service began interrogating Hitler’s biological weapons makers, many of whom were interned at Dustbin. The Chemical Warfare Service saw enormous potential in making the Nazis’ biological weapons program its own and sought any scientific intelligence it could get. The man most wanted in this effort was Hitler’s top biological weapons expert, Dr. Kurt Blome. On June 29, 1945, Blome was sent to Dustbin. The officers assigned to interrogate him were Bill Cromartie and J. M. Barnes of Operation Alsos. Each man was uniquely familiar with Blome’s background. Cromartie had been in Dr. Eugen Haagen’s apartment in Strasbourg in November 1944 when he and Alsos scientific director Samuel Goudsmit made the awful discovery that the Reich had been experimenting on people during the war (Blome was named in the Haagen files).

And it was Cromartie and Barnes who led the investigation of the Geraberg facility, the abandoned, curiouslooking research outpost hidden in the Thuringian Forest. Both Cromartie and Barnes had concluded that Geraberg had been a laboratory for Reich biological weapons research and that Dr. Blome was in charge. During his initial interview at Dustbin, Blome refused to cooperate. “When he was first interrogated, he was very evasive,” Cromartie and Barnes wrote. But a few days later, when interrogated in more detail, Blome’s “attitude changed completely and he seemed anxious to give a full account not only [of] what he actually did but what he had in mind for future work.” Cromartie and Barnes were unsure if they should be enthused by Blome’s seeming change of heart or suspicious of it. Blome had been observed in the Dustbin eating hall conversing at length with Dr. Heinrich Kliewe, the Reich’s counterintelligence agent for bacterial warfare concerns. Perhaps the two men were concocting a misinformation scheme. Germany’s enemies, most notably Russia. “Kliewe claims that he himself did all the evaluating of the reports received and determined what course of action his department should thenceforth follow,” investigators wrote in Kliewe’s Dustbin dossier. Kliewe told Blome that he would likely be taken to Heidelberg for a lengthy interrogation with Alsos agents, as Kliewe had been. If Cromartie and Barnes were surprised by Blome’s sudden willingness to talk, they were also aware that most of what he told them could not be independently verified. “It is quite impossible to check many of his statements and what follows is an account of what he related,” read a note in Blome’s Dustbin dossier. What Blome recounted was a dark tale of plans for biological warfare spearheaded by Heinrich Himmler. Himmler had a layman’s fascination with biological warfare. A former chicken farmer, the Reichsführer-SS had studied agriculture in school. According to Blome, it was Himmler who was the primary motivator behind the Reich’s bioweapons program. Hitler, Blome said, did not approve of biological warfare and was kept in the dark as to specific plans. Himmler’s area of greatest fascination, said Blome, was bubonic plague. At their first meeting, which occurred in the summer of 1943—Blome recalled it as being July or August—Himmler ordered Blome to study various dissemination methods of plague bacteria for offensive warfare. According to Blome, he shared with Himmler his fears regarding the dangerous boomerang effect a plague bomb would most likely have on Germany.

According to Blome, he shared with Himmler his fears regarding the dangerous boomerang effect a plague bomb would most likely have on Germany. Himmler told Blome that in that case, he should get to work immediately to produce a vaccine to prevent such a thing. To expedite vaccine research, Blome said, Himmler ordered him “to use human beings.” Himmler offered Blome a medical block at a concentration camp like Dachau where he could complete this work. Blome said he told Himmler he was aware of “strong objections in certain circles” to using humans in experimental vaccine trials. Himmler told Blome that experimenting on humans was necessary in the war effort. To refuse was “the equivalent of treason.” Very well, said Blome. He considered himself a loyal Nazi, and it was his intention to help Germany win the war. “History gives us examples of human disease affecting the outcome of wars,” Blome told his Alsos interrogators, taking a moment to lecture them on history. “We know [that] from antiquity up till the time of [the] Napoleonic wars, victories and defeats were often determined by epidemics and starvation,” Blome said. Spreading an infectious disease could bring about the demise of a marauding army, and Blome said that the failure of Napoleon’s Russian campaign was “due in great part to the infection of his horses with Glanders,” a highly contagious bacterial disease. History aside, Blome said he counseled Himmler on the fact that a concentration camp was a terrible place to experiment with bubonic plague because the population was too dense. Blome then told Himmler that if he were to experiment with plague bacterium, he would need his own institute, an isolated facility far removed from population centers. Himmler and Blome agreed that Poland would be a good place, and they settled on Nesselstedt, a small town outside the former Poznań University (by then operated by the Reich). Blome’s research institute was to be called the Bacteriological Institute at Nesselstedt. In the interim, in Berlin, Blome oversaw a field test using rats, history’s traditional carrier of bubonic plague. A debate had been taking place inside the Hygiene Institute of the Waffen-SS as to whether or not rats were the best plague carriers. Himmler’s idea was “to take infected rats on to Uboats and release them near the enemy shores so they could swim to land.” Blome doubted that rats could swim great distances. He believed they could swim only for as long as the air in their fur kept them afloat. To prove his point, Blome arranged for a test on a Berlin lake. “About thirty rats were", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:Operation Paperclip_cleaned.txt:111:1591fade7026", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 6024, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "Operation Paperclip_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/031622104X", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "Operation Paperclip_cleaned", "chunk_index": 112, "text": "of the Waffen-SS as to whether or not rats were the best plague carriers.

He believed they could swim only for as long as the air in their fur kept them afloat. To prove his point, Blome arranged for a test on a Berlin lake. “About thirty rats were taken out in a police boat and released at different distances from the shore to swim both with and against the wind.” Blome said that the rats were dumber than he thought—that when placed in the water, “they had no idea where the shore was and swam around in different directions.” A few of them drowned in ten minutes. The longest any of the rats swam for was thirty minutes. Of those released a little over a half-mile from shore, only a third reached land. As far as Blome was concerned, Himmler’s U-boat dispersal idea was not practical. Meeting Number Two took place a month or two later, in September or October 1943, and was largely a repetition of the first, at least according to Blome. There was one significant development, however. Himmler asked Blome if he needed an assistant. Blome agreed that a bacteriologist would be helpful. Himmler assigned Dr. Karl Gross, formerly a staff member at the Waffen-SS Hygiene Institute. The two doctors did not get along. Blome became convinced that Dr. Gross had been sent by Himmler to spy on him. He told his interrogators that he was under great pressure to work faster. Himmler repeatedly “reiterated that the methods of waging BW [biological warfare] must be studied in order to understand the defense against it.” What this meant was that Himmler wanted Blome to infect human test subjects with plague to see what would happen to them. The third meeting took place four or five months later, in February 1944. By this time, Blome said, the facility at Nesselstedt had been built. There was ample staff housing, a well-equipped laboratory, and an animal farm. The block for experimental work included a climate room, a cold room, disinfectant facilities, and rooms for “clean” and “dirty” experiments. There was an isolation hospital for sixteen people in the event that workers on Blome’s staff contracted the disease. Work progressed slowly, Blome said, and Himmler became enraged. Rumors of an Allied invasion of the European continent had become a constant thorn in the side of the Reichsführer-SS. Why wasn’t the Reich’s bioweapons program more advanced, Himmler demanded to know. He asked Blome if it was possible to “do something now—for example disseminate influenza—that would delay the heralded Anglo-American invasion in the West.” According to Blome, he told Himmler “it was impossible to do anything on these lines.” Himmler proposed another", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:Operation Paperclip_cleaned.txt:112:a12dd39e448c", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 6025, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "Operation Paperclip_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/031622104X", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "Operation Paperclip_cleaned", "chunk_index": 113, "text": "slowly, Blome said, and Himmler became enraged.

He asked Blome if it was possible to “do something now—for example disseminate influenza—that would delay the heralded Anglo-American invasion in the West.” According to Blome, he told Himmler “it was impossible to do anything on these lines.” Himmler proposed another idea: How about disseminating a virulent strain of hoof-and-mouth disease? Or tularemia, also called rabbit fever, which affected man in a manner similar to plague? Blome told Himmler that these were dangerous ideas, as any outbreak would surely affect Germany’s troops. The Reich needed a massive stockpile of vaccinations before it could feasibly launch a biological attack. Himmler stretched his thinking to target the Allies on their own soil. How about spreading cattle plague, also called rinderpest, in America or England? Himmler told Blome that infecting the enemy’s food supply would have a sinister effect on enemy troops. Blome agreed and said he would investigate what it would take to start a plague epidemic among the enemies’ cows. There was, however, a problem, Blome explained. An international agreement prohibited stocks of the rinderpest virus to be stored anywhere in Europe. Strains of cattle plague were available only in the third world. Himmler said that he would get the cattle plague himself. He sent Dr. Erich Traub, a veterinarian from the Reich’s State Research Institute, located on the island of Riems, to Turkey. There, Dr. Traub acquired a strain of the lethal rinderpest virus. Under Blome’s direction, trials to infect healthy cows with rinderpest began. Riems, in northern Germany in the Bay of Greifswald, was totally isolated and self-contained. It was the perfect place for these dangerous tests. The veterinary section used airplanes to spray the cattle plague virus on the island’s grassy fields, where cows grazed. Blome said he didn’t know much more about the program or its results—only that Dr. Traub, second in command at the research facility, was taken by the Russians when the Red Army captured Riems, in April 1945. Blome’s fourth meeting with Himmler took place in April or May of 1944. Himmler had become paranoid by now, Blome said. He believed that the Allies were plotting a biological weapons attack against the Reich. “Blome was summoned by telephone to see Himmler urgently. The latter had received a number of curious reports. Grass had come floating out of the sky over some part of Austria and a cow that had eaten some of it had died.” Blome told Himmler he’d look into it.

And potato beetles had been dropped in Normandy. Blome promised to study each incident. Blome told Himmler he had a pressing issue of his own. Given the progress of the Red Army, he thought it was wise to move his plague research institute at Posen (Poznań) somewhere inside Germany. The place Blome suggested was Geraberg, in the Thuringian forest, at the edge of the Harz Mountains. Himmler said that the Russians would never reach Posen. By early fall, he had changed his mind. In October a new biological weapons research facility was being built, concealed inside a pine forest in the village of Geraberg. In the meantime, Blome told his interrogators, work on vaccines was moving forward—not at either of his research institutes but inside the army instead. Göring had moved epidemic control into the jurisdiction of a major general named Dr. Walter Schreiber, surgeon general of the Reich. Blome held the position of deputy surgeon general of the Reich, but the two men had equal positions under Göring, Blome explained. He, Blome, was in charge of creating the biological weapons; Dr. Schreiber was in charge of protecting Germans against biological weapons, should they be used— Major General Dr. Schreiber specialized in epidemic control. The sword and the shield. Blome said something else that alarmed interrogators. During the war, Dr. Kliewe told Blome that it was the Russians who had the single most extensive biological weapons program in the world—a program more advanced even than that of the Japanese. Further, the Russians had managed to capture everything from Dr. Traub’s laboratory on Riems, including Dr. Traub’s Turkish strain of cattle plague. Then, in the winter of 1945, the Russians had captured Blome’s bacteriological institute at Nesselstedt, outside Posen. This meant the Russians now had the Reich’s most advanced biological weapons research and development facility, its steam chambers, incubators, refrigerators, and deepfreeze apparatus. They also had all of the pathogens—viral and bacterial—that Blome had been working with when he had fled west. The future of the scientists at Dustbin was obscure. Would they be hired by the U.S. government for future work, or would they be prosecuted by the Allies for war crimes?

At Ashcan the future facing the Nazi high command was almost certainly grim, although there was much work to do. War crimes prosecutors faced a monumental task. They had to build criminal cases from scratch, a conundrum described by Nuremberg trials prosecutor General Telford Taylor after the war. “ Our task was to prepare to prosecute the leading Nazis on [specific] criminal charges.… The first question a prosecuting attorney asks in such a situation is, ‘Where’s the evidence?’ The blunt fact was that, despite what ‘everybody knew’ about the Nazi leaders, virtually no judicially admissible evidence was at hand.” For evidence, prosecutors like Telford Taylor were relying on interrogators like John Dolibois to glean facts from the Nazis interned at Ashcan. Frustration was mounting at Ashcan. Prisoners were conspiring to withhold information. “They were whispering rather important secrets to each other,” Ashcan’s commander, Colonel Burton Andrus, recalled, “determined not to help on the question of hidden loot, the whereabouts of people like Martin Bormann, and the guilt for war atrocities.” Colonel Andrus racked his brain for ideas. How to make guilty men talk? “To jog the prisoners’ memories back to the reality of their grave situation we decided to show them atrocity films taken at Buchenwald.” Colonel Andrus assembled his fifty-two Nazi prisoners in one room. Before the film began, he addressed them with the following words: “You know about these things and I have no doubt many of you participated actively in them. We are showing them to you not to inform you of what you already know, but to impress on you the fact that we know of it, too.” The lights went down and the first frames of the documentary footage flickered across the screen. Colonel Andrus watched his prisoners. Hans Frank, governor general of occupied Poland, the lawyer and PhD largely responsible for the murder of the Jewish population there, put a handkerchief to his mouth and gagged. Joachim von Ribbentrop, the former champagne salesman who became Hitler’s foreign minister and pressured foreign states to allow the deportation of Jews in their territories to extermination camps in the east, got up from his chair and walked out of the room. Albert Kesselring, commander of the Luftwaffe invasions into Poland, France, and the Soviet Union, who also led the Battle of Britain, turned white. Hermann Göring sighed as if bored. Julius Streicher, the schoolteacher who became Hitler’s mouthpiece and encouraged readers to exterminate the Jews, sat on his chair “clasping and unclasping his hands.” When the film was over, no one said a word.

A little while later, Walter Funk, the fifty-five-year-old former minister of the war economy and president of the Reichsbank, asked to see Colonel Andrus alone. Small, overweight, and suffering from venereal disease, this once supremely powerful Nazi Part official twisted his fingers anxiously, while telling Colonel Andrus he had a confession to make. Walter Funk “looked incapable of running a filling-station, let alone a bank,” Andrus recalled. Funk fidgeted nervously. “I have something to tell you, sir,” Andrus recalled Funk saying. “I have been a bad man, Colonel, and I want to tell about it.” Funk started to cry. Then he told Colonel Andrus that it was he who gave the order that all gold in every prisoner’s mouth—in every concentration camp across the Reich—be removed and collected for the Reichsbank’s reserves. Funk confessed that at first he’d “had [the gold] knocked out of their mouths while they were alive, but [realized] if they were dead there was far less bother.” Andrus was appalled. “I had never believed before that such a horrific order as the one Funk was confessing to had ever been given,” Andrus said. Colonel Andrus told Funk to leave. In his memoir, Andrus wondered what Walter Funk had hoped to gain from his confession; he never got his answer. Whatever motivated Funk that day at Ashcan eventually disappeared. Months later, at Nuremberg, Funk denied that the conversation with Colonel Andrus had ever taken place. Instead, he swore under oath that he had never been connected with orders involving acquiring gold from Jews. “If it was done,” declared Funk, “it has been kept from me up till now.” Save Funk’s tearful confession, the screening of the Buchenwald atrocity film had no apparent effect on the other prisoners. The men who gagged and left the room had nothing more to say, and the rest of the Nazi high command remained tight-lipped about their crimes. Colonel Andrus grew increasingly frustrated. The prisoners were allowed to sit outside in the Palace Hotel garden, in small groups out of earshot of prison guards. There, Andrus watched Hitler’s closest confidants prattle on among themselves. “They could sit out in the garden in the spring sunshine and chatter to their hearts’ content,” recalled Andrus. “Undoubtedly they compared notes on the interrogation[s] which went on in sixteen booths every day.” If only G-2 had wired the Ashcan garden for sound. Colonel Andrus got an idea.

Colonel Andrus got an idea. He made a list of the four men who he believed were the biggest “backstabbers and gossips” in the group. “Those with outspoken views about their fellow Nazis—men ready to blame each other for their own crimes.” Göring, “verbose,” von Papen, “malicious,” Kesselring, “vain,” and Admiral Horthy, “the Prince of Austria who believed he was better than everyone else,” were chosen. With permission from headquarters, Andrus devised an elaborate ruse intended to extract information from the Nazi prisoners. The four men were told that they were being handed over to the British for interrogation; that soon they would be traveling to a villa in Germany to be questioned there. In reality, Army Intelligence, G-2, had rented a house located three and a half miles from Ashcan. It was a traditional German-style half-timber house with a high wall running around its perimeter. U.S. Army signal intelligence engineers spent several days running hundreds of yards of wires through the house, under floorboards, behind walls, inside furniture cushions and lighting fixtures. In a final touch, they wired the garden for sound. The engineers burrowed through the backyard garden and attached tiny microphones to a single tree above the sitting area. All wires connected back to a recording machine capable of laying audio tracks down onto gramophone records. This was high technology in the summer of 1945. At the Ashcan detention center, Göring, von Papen, Kesselring, and Admiral Horthy were loaded into an ambulance, a common means of transport after the war, and driven away. Black curtains had been drawn across the vehicle windows so the prisoners couldn’t see where they were being taken. For hours, the ambulance drove around in what Andrus called a “circuitous route,” covering fifty miles of terrain but never leaving Luxembourg. When the ambulance pulled up to the Germaniclooking house and unloaded the Nazis, Göring was thrilled. The bedrooms in the new quarters had fresh sheets, plush mattresses, and soft pillows. Strolling through the house, Göring pointed to a chandelier and warned his fellow Nazis to be wary of listening devices.

It was a brilliant start. But only a start. Soon, it began to rain. The men moved inside. There, they sat around barely saying a word. The following day, it rained again. That evening, Colonel Andrus received an order from SHAEF. The eavesdropping project was being shut down. Andrus had twenty-four hours to pack up his prisoners and leave. Back at Ashcan, things moved in a whirlwind. John Dolibois received a “Letter of Authority” on August 10, 1945, stating that CCPWE No. 32 was going to be closed down. Dolibois was to be part of the transport team now taking prisoners to new locations. For reasons Dolibois was not privy to, thirty-three of the fifty-two Ashcan internees were going to a new prisoner of war interrogation facility, this one located in the small town of Oberursel in the Taunus Mountains. Only later would Dolibois learn that many of these Nazis would be hired by the U.S. Army to write intelligence reports on work they had done during the war. Oberursel was just a few miles from the Dustbin facility at Castle Kransberg. The transport would be a convoy of six ambulances, a command car, a jeep, a trailer, and a truck carrying the prisoners’ suitcases. Dolibois was assigned to ride in the first ambulance. His prisoner list included Admiral Karl Dönitz, Field Marshal Albert Kesselring, General Walter Warlimont, cabinet minister Schwerin von Krosigk, OKW Foreign Office head Admiral Leopold Bürkner, and Admiral Gerhard Wagner. The trip from Mondorf to Oberursel was a journey through ruined countryside. Crossing from Luxembourg into Germany, Dolibois watched the chatter among the Nazis in his backseat come to a “halting end” as they saw the destruction and despair everywhere. “This was their first look at the condition of their country” since the war, Dolibois explained. From churches to administrative buildings to shops, entire villages had been reduced to rubble. In three months of peace there were no resources to clean anything up. People were starving and trying to survive. “The destruction that was the aftermath of Hitler’s determination to ‘fight to the last man,’” said Dolibois. The convoy arrived in Oberursel. Like many other army interrogation facilities across the American zone in postwar Germany, the one in Oberursel had been an important Third Reich military post during the war. Oberursel had a particularly storied past.

Like many other army interrogation facilities across the American zone in postwar Germany, the one in Oberursel had been an important Third Reich military post during the war. Oberursel had a particularly storied past. This Dulag Luft, or Durchgangslager (terms for air force prisoner of war camp, or transit camp), had functioned as the sole interrogation and evaluation center for the Luftwaffe. It was here that Nazi interrogators had questioned every Allied pilot who had been shot down during the war. The Luftwaffe’s lead interrogator, Hanns Scharff, kept a diary. “Every enemy aviator who is captured… will be brought to this place for questioning. It makes no difference whether he is taken prisoner at the front lines or whether he comes dangling down from the sky in the most remote location… he comes to Oberursel,” wrote Scharff. Physically, things had not changed much since Oberursel had changed hands. The interrogation facility centered around a large half-timber “mountain house” that served as an officers’ club. Nearby there were fourteen buildings for officer housing. The prisoners’ barracks, a large U-shaped building, contained 150 solitary jail cells. This building had been called “The Cooler” during the war, and it was the place where interrogator Hanns Scharff did most of his work with captured Allied pilots. Now it was the new home for thirty-three former Ashcan internees, at least for a while. Dolibois turned his charges over to the guard detail at Oberursel. His orders said to return to Luxembourg and wait for new orders. Setting out for Ashcan, he rode in the lead jeep with an enlisted man. A little less than an hour south of Frankfurt, Dolibois came upon a row of U.S. Army trucks stopped along the side of the road. One of the soldiers stepped into the road and signaled for Dolibois’s convoy to stop. John Dolibois climbed out of his jeep. He became overwhelmed by a horrific stench, “sickeningly sweet, nauseating,” he later recalled. He heard retching. Several of the men in his convoy had gotten out of their vehicles and were now throwing up along the side of the road. The captain climbed out of his jeep. He did not say a word but motioned for Dolibois to follow him behind one of the two-and-a-half-ton trucks. In silence, the captain untied a rope and flipped back a sheet of canvas that had obscured the cargo from view until now. Dolibois stared into the body of the truck. It took him a moment for him to realize what he was looking at: rotting corpses. “Putrefied,” he recalled. “Most were naked. Some still wore the pajama-like striped pants, the concentration camp uniforms, now just rotting rags.

Some still wore the pajama-like striped pants, the concentration camp uniforms, now just rotting rags. It was the most horrible sight I had ever seen.” The army captain spoke in a flat, emotionless tone. “There are thousands of them, five truck loads,” he told Dolibois. “We’re hauling them from one mass grave to another. Don’t ask me why.” These were bodies from Dachau. Corpses found upon liberation. The army captain’s convoy had come to a standstill after one of the vehicles had broken down. They’d been waiting at the roadside for an escort when Dolibois’s convoy from Oberursel had arrived. The captain asked Dolibois if his group could escort them to the next military station down the road. Dolibois agreed. “I found myself leading a bizarre caravan: six empty ambulances, an empty weapons carrier, followed by five twoand-a-half-ton trucks loaded with the obscenity of the Nazi final solution,” remembered Dolibois. The dead bodies were being taken to a proper burial spot on orders from the Office of Military Government, United States (OMGUS). Back at Ashcan the world appeared different to him now. There, the rest of Hitler’s inner circle remained, men “directly responsible for that ghastly transport,” said Dolibois. If John Dolibois ever had a shred of doubt about the degree of barbarism and the collective guilt of the men he had spent three months interrogating at Ashcan, in that moment there was no hesitation anymore. At age ninetythree, John Dolibois says, “I still smell that foul odor of death.” But in August 1945, there was barely any time for the young interrogator to process what he had witnessed. Back at Ashcan he fell into bed and slept hard. Come morning, John Dolibois received new orders from Colonel Andrus. There was still a group of Nazi Bonzen at Ashcan. Dolibois was to be on the team that would move them to the Nuremberg prison. Colonel Andrus had selected John Dolibois to fly with the remaining members of the Nazi high command on a transport plane. Dawn, August 12, 1945. The sun had not yet risen in the sky. Ashcan’s last group of Nazis were escorted out of the classified interrogation facility and driven in ambulances a short distance to the airport at Luxembourg City. A C-47 transport plane idled on the tarmac, stripped down to its bare bones. Inside the aircraft, a single row of seats ran down each side.

There was a honey bucket toilet and a urinal attached to a door at the back of the airplane. To Dolibois, it seemed as if Colonel Andrus was nervous. “Something was cooking,” Dolibois recalled. Security was always on the colonel’s mind. “Aha!” Dolibois realized what it was. “Kaltenbrunner!” Ernst Kaltenbrunner was considered the most dangerous Nazi among the high command. At 674^(′′) , he was a giant man with a massive frame, a pockmarked face, and a huge head with seven or eight deep dueling scars running across both sides of his forehead, cheeks, and chin. He drank and smoked heavily and was missing teeth. Kaltenbrunner was described by the British journalist Rebecca West as looking like “a particularly vicious horse.” He held a doctorate in law and specialized in secret police work. He was the head of the Reich Security Main Office and chief of the security police and the security services. He was as actively involved in concentration camp crimes as any Nazi had been. According to the OSS, even Heinrich Himmler was frightened of him. If anyone was going to “cause trouble on the flight to Nuremberg,” Dolibois explains, Colonel Andrus was worried that Ernst Kaltenbrunner might. “Special precautions needed to be taken.” Kaltenbrunner would be handcuffed to Dolibois’s left wrist. “If he starts to run or goes for the door,” Colonel Andrus told Dolibois, “shoot!” Colonel Andrus wished John Dolibois “good luck” during the flight and said that he would see him once they landed in Nuremberg. Colonel Andrus would be traveling in a different airplane. During the flight Kaltenbrunner did not run for the door. Instead, he wanted to talk. He told Dolibois that he desired for the young interrogator to understand that he, Kaltenbrunner, was not responsible for war crimes. “He felt the need to explain about the Jews,” Dolibois recalled, with Kaltenbrunner saying, “admittedly, he hated them, but he said that he had not been involved in their treatment in concentration camps. In fact, he claimed to have remonstrated with Hitler on the treatment of the Jews.” As the airplane prepared to land in Nuremberg, Kaltenbrunner said what so many Nazis repeated after the war. “I am a soldier and I only obeyed orders,” he told Dolibois. “I didn’t argue with him, I just listened,” Dolibois said. “Kaltenbrunner was a ruthless killer determined to save his own skin. His soft talk did not change my mind about him, but it helped pass the time.” When the aircraft finally touched the ground, Dolibois felt a huge wave of relief.

The prisoners were unloaded, and Colonel Andrus assumed control of them once again. Without looking back, Dolibois hurried on to the transport plane. The plane taxied down the runway and took flight. Dolibois sat alone in the empty airplane. The weeks of interrogating the Nazi high command were over. The Nazis he had just flown with would now be tried for war crimes at the Palace of Justice in Nuremberg. A majority of them would be hanged. Back at Ashcan, when Dolibois returned to his quarters to pack his bags, he came across a strange sight. Standing by the edge of the perimeter fence, not far from where Dolibois had first pulled up to this place in an army jeep three months before, he spotted a middle-aged man, apparently a local, with his hands in his pockets and a beret on his head. The man just stood there, shouting out in the direction of the Palace Hotel. Dolibois took a moment to pause and listen so he could make out what the man was saying. It took a moment for the significance of what the man was doing to register with Dolibois. The phrase translated into English as “Hello, Meier! Hello, Meier! So, how’s it going in Berlin?” The beauty of the moment dawned on him. In the early days of the war, Hermann Göring was so confident the Third Reich would win the war that he’d famously bragged to the German people, “If the British and the Americans ever bomb Berlin, my name is Meier.” In Washington, on July 6, 1945, in a classified memorandum with the subject heading “Exploitation of German Specialists in Science and Technology in the United States,” the Joint Chiefs of Staff finally approved—on paper—a Nazi scientist program. President Truman was not made aware of the initiative. The governing body that had been assigned to “exercise general supervision” over the program and to “formulate general policies for procurement, utilization and control of specialists” was the Military Intelligence Division of the War Department, G-2. A five-page memo was sent out to eight agencies within the War Department outlining “principles and procedures” governing the classified program. The three most important points were that “certain German specialists… could be utilized to increase our war making capacity against Japan and aid our postwar military research,” that “no known or alleged war criminals should be brought to the United States,” and that", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:Operation Paperclip_cleaned.txt:122:74bb045f6bed", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 6035, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "Operation Paperclip_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/031622104X", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "Operation Paperclip_cleaned", "chunk_index": 123, "text": "procurement, utilization and control of specialists” was the Military Intelligence Division of the War Department, G-2.

Included in the mix were Nazi bureaucrats, businessmen, accountants, and lawyers. The project also now had an official code name, Operation Overcast. The name Paperclip would not be used for another eight months. Military agencies that were interested in hiring German specialists were to submit their requests to the assistant chief of staff, G-2. “Only the most compelling argument should bring a German specialist to this country,” the initiative stated, and only the “chosen, rare minds whose continuing intellectual productivity we wish to use” would be approved. The British would be made aware of the program, in general terms. At some point after the first large group of scientists had arrived in the United States, a “suitable” press release would be generated by the War Department so as to “avoid possible resentment on the part of the American public.” A list of desired German scientists—“List I”—accompanied the memo. It included 115 rocket specialists. When the British learned about the U.S. Army’s intentions to hire the German rocket scientists, they asked to first be allowed to conduct two rocket exploitation projects of their own. The Americans agreed and released into British custody a group of scientists, engineers, and technicians including Wernher von Braun, Walter Dornberger, and Arthur Rudolph. Germany’s north coast, at a former Krupp naval gun range in Cuxhaven. Operation Backfire was designed to analyze technical data about the V-2 by having the Nazi rocket engineers fire four rockets, also taken piecemeal from Nordhausen, at a target in the North Sea. This would allow the British to evaluate various technical elements, from how the rocket was launched to its flight controls and fuels. Arthur Rudolph, the former Mittelwerk operations director, was considered an expert in launch techniques, and to his biographer, he later recalled a scene from Operation Backfire: “The V-2 ran on alcohol of the same chemistry as that appearing in say, Jack Daniels and Old Grandad [sic] .

The people at the test site apparently knew that.” One night, according to Rudolph, a group of British and German V-2 technicians got drunk together on the rocket fuel. A British officer came upon the group arm in arm, “apparently comrades now, and lustily singing, Wir Fahren gegen England, or ‘We Will March Against England.’” General Dornberger was not part of the drinking and singing. The British kept him on a short leash, away from the test firing and always under a watchful eye. The British had alternative plans for Walter Dornberger. They were not interested in the knowledge Dornberger possessed. They wanted to try him for war crimes. After the test, he would not be returned to the Americans as the British had originally promised. “The British pulled a sneaky on us,” explained Major Staver, who attended Operation Backfire. The Americans were not permitted to take Dornberger back after the Operation; instead, Dornberger was declared “on loan” and was taken to England. There, he and von Braun were “interrogated for a week by the British and then kept behind barbed wire in Wimbledon for four and one-half weeks while waiting to be picked up by the Americans.” Eventually, von Braun was returned but General Dornberger was not. Instead, he was issued a brown jumpsuit with the letters “PW” for Prisoner of War stenciled on the back. Under armed guard, he was taken to the London District Cage near the Windermere Bridge for interrogation. From there, General Dornberger was transferred first to a castle in Wales and then to Special Camp XI in Island Farm, South Wales, where he was an extremely unpopular prisoner. “Walter Dornberger was definitely the most hated man in the camp,” Sergeant Ron Williams, a prison guard, recalled. “Even his own people hated him. He never went out to the local farms to work like other prisoners.” Wherever General Dornberger went while he was at Special Camp XI, he required an escort. The British feared that other prisoners might kill him. On the morning of September 12, 1945, Wernher von Braun, Dr. Eberhard Rees, and five midlevel V-2 rocket engineers left their U.S. Army–sponsored housing, in the town of Witzenhausen, for the last time.

The men climbed into two army jeeps, headed for France. The Germans knew they were heading to the United States to work. They were not aware that their driver, First Lieutenant Morris Sipser, spoke German. As First Lieutenant Sipser drove the group to their destination in Paris, he listened to von Braun crack crass anti-American jokes. The jeep crossed over the Saar River into France, and Sipser overheard von Braun say to his colleagues, “Well, take a good look at Germany, fellows. You may not see it for a long time to come.” In Washington, Operation Overcast had been approved as a “temporary” program, but von Braun, ever the visionary, had the foresight to see that many of the rocketeers and engineers were heading to America to stay. “We felt no moral scruples about the possible future use of our brainchild,” von Braun later told New Yorker magazine writer Daniel Lang. “We were interested solely in exploring outer space. It was simply a question with us of how the golden cow could be milked most successfully.” Accompanying von Braun, Rees, and the five other V-2 engineers were four scientists from the Hermann Göring Research Institute, handpicked by Colonel Putt and headed for Wright Field. They were Theodor Zobel, Rudolph Edse, Wolfgang Noggerath and Gerhard Braun. Luftwaffe test pilot Karl Baur was also with the group; he had served as aircraft manufacturer Messerschmitt’s chief Me-262 test pilot. Accompanying him he had his mechanic, Andreas Sebald. A little before 10 : 00 p.m. , the Germans boarded a C-54 military transport plane waiting on the tarmac in the pouring rain. After a stop to refuel on the island of Santa Maria, in the Azores, the aircraft crossed the Atlantic, refueled in Newfoundland, and landed at New Castle Airport in Wilmington, Delaware, at 2:00 a.m. on September 20, 1945. Because the Germans were under military custody, they could not be traditionally processed by Customs. After a few hours, the sixteen Germans boarded a second, smaller airplane and were flown to the Naval Air Station at Squantum, in Quincy, Massachusetts. At the naval base the Germans were loaded into sedans and driven out to the edge of dock, where a troopship waited for them. They boarded the vessel and made a short trip to a chain of small islands in Boston Harbor, the Harbor Islands, and out to the far end to a gravel shoal off Nixes Mate, where they were obscured from civilian view. There, a small Boston whaler idled on the sea. Its captain was named Corky, and the twenty-one-year-old intelligence officer who would take charge of the Germans was named Henry Kolm.", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:Operation Paperclip_cleaned.txt:125:dafc327e8580", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 6038, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "Operation Paperclip_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/031622104X", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "Operation Paperclip_cleaned", "chunk_index": 126, "text": "edge of dock, where a troopship waited for them.

Each German scientist was lowered down into the little Boston whaler by a harness hanging from a rope. “They were all seasick as can be,” Kolm later recalled. Fort Strong, on an island in the middle of Boston Harbor, had been used as a training camp during the Civil War and remained in use on and off through World War I. The fortresslike nature of the coastal defense facility made it an ideal place for a secret military program like Operation Overcast. When the first German scientists arrived in September 1945, the fortress was still under army control but had not been used for nearly thirty years. Thick weeds grew in between the gun blocks and pedestal mounts. The administration and observation buildings had fallen into disrepair. But the army barracks was easily converted into what would become known as the Operation Overcast hotel. German prisoners of war were moved onto the island to work as staff, including as translators, cooks, bakers, and tailors. Kolm’s job was to process the scientists, which included fingerprinting, medical examinations, and coordination with the FBI. This all took time, and the Germans were not known for patience. Before long an insidious unease settled in among the scientists, Kolm recalled. When the weather was clear the Germans played volleyball games outside. Far off in the distance they could make out the Boston skyline and see the tall, shiny buildings on shore. But often the fog rolled in, and the island was soaked in a thick, dense mist for days at a time. To pass the time the scientists stayed indoors and played Monopoly, which they called the “capitalists’ game.” Still, it was impossible to deny that Fort Strong took on a penal colony feel, as Kolm recalled. Soon the Germans started calling their new home Devil’s Island. Finally, on September 29, 1945, Major James P. Hamill, an intelligence officer with the Army Ordnance Corps, was sent to the east coast of the island to escort a group of Germans off. Hamill had been in Nordhausen with Major Staver at war’s end and had personally assisted in the mission to locate enough rocket parts to reconfigure one hundred of them at the White Sands Proving Ground. His presence on Devil’s Island had to have been a welcome one among the rocket scientists.

Hamill took six of them—Eberhard Rees, Erich Neubert, The train ride began on October 6, 1945, and was a memorable event. Operation Overcast was a highly classified military matter, and Major Hamill was required to keep watch over von Braun twenty-four hours a day. Drawing any kind of attention to the German scientist was to be avoided at all cost. In St. Louis, Major Hamill and von Braun were assigned to a Pullman car filled with wounded war veterans from the 82nd Division, renowned for parachute assaults into Sicily and Salerno. Also in the train car were wounded war veterans from the 101st Airborne Division, men lauded for action in the Normandy invasion and the Battle of the Bulge. Hamill quickly arranged for himself and von Braun to be moved into a different car. The train moved along to the Texas border. Hamill watched as the man sitting next to von Braun began engaging him in friendly conversation, asking von Braun where he was from and what business he was in. Von Braun, apparently well versed in lying on demand, replied that he was from Switzerland and that he was in “the steel business.” “Well it turned out that this particular gentleman knew Switzerland like the back of his hand,” Major Hamill later recalled, “and was himself in the steel business.” Von Braun quickly qualified “steel business” to mean “ball bearings.” As it so happened the man was also an expert on ball bearings, Hamill explained. The train whistle blew. The approaching station stop was Texarkana, which was the businessman’s destination. As the man prepared to exit the train he turned back to von Braun and waved good-bye to him. Army Ordnance finally had their scientists on U.S. soil, and work commenced at Fort Bliss without delay. In Germany, the drama between the U.S. Chemical Warfare Service and FIAT over the suspected war criminal Otto Ambros escalated. Despite orders from SHAEF to arrest him, Ambros remained a fugitive in plain sight. He lived and worked with impunity in the French zone. At Dustbin, FIAT officers continued to learn more about who Ambros was and the wartime role that he had played in chemical weapons research and development. In an interrogation with Albert Speer, FIAT learned that no single person had been as critical to the development of Hitler’s vast arsenal of nerve agents and poison gases as Otto Ambros had been. “He is known to have spoken to Hitler at a highlevel German conference", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:Operation Paperclip_cleaned.txt:127:ae33660a425a", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 6040, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "Operation Paperclip_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/031622104X", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "Operation Paperclip_cleaned", "chunk_index": 128, "text": "worked with impunity in the French zone.

In an interrogation with Albert Speer, FIAT learned that no single person had been as critical to the development of Hitler’s vast arsenal of nerve agents and poison gases as Otto Ambros had been. “He is known to have spoken to Hitler at a highlevel German conference on Chemical Warfare,” a FIAT report read. Another stated, “Ambros’ importance, from the Intelligence point of view, has been re-emphasized by the recent Chemical Warfare investigation at ‘Dustbin.’ Speer and the German Chemical Warfare experts agree that he is the key man in German Chemical Warfare production.” Major Tilley was outraged by it all, but there was little he could do except put Ambros under surveillance. Initial attempts to capture Dr. Ambros maintained the fiction of civility. “At the end of August or beginning of September 1945, an attempt was made to induce Ambros to return to the American zone,” Tilley wrote in a FIAT report. In response, “ Ambros claimed to be unable to return then as the French authorities would not permit him to leave the French zone.” Major Tilley knew this was a lie. Ambros regularly traveled back and forth between Ludwigshafen, in the French zone, and the IG Farben guesthouse, Villa Kohlhof, outside Heidelberg, in the American zone. This made Tilley furious. “This man is thought to be far too dangerous and undesirable to be left at liberty, let alone be employed by the Allied authorities,” Tilley wrote. FIAT authorized him to set up a sting operation in an attempt to capture and arrest Ambros. Captain Edelsten was assigned the job of tracking Ambros day and night. Through the Counter Intelligence Corps in Heidelberg, Captain Edelsten, working with a Colonel Mumford, set up a network of undercover agents who began to follow Ambros’s every move. “Saw Ambros at LU [Ludwigshafen],” read one report. “Drives his own car, usually alone. Slept in car for two hours one night, on roadside,” another set of field notes revealed. Ambros traveled frequently: to Freiburg, Rheinfelden, and Baden-Baden. He’d even been back to Gendorf—a brazen move, considering the Seventh Army had an outstanding arrest warrant for him there. But Ambros was quicker than the U.S. Army and had a better intelligence network in place as well. Whenever the U.S. Army showed up to arrest him, he was already gone. Finally, Captain Edelsten reached Ambros on the telephone. “Edelsten told Ambros that Col. Mumford was anxious to see him again,” and asked if a meeting could be arranged for the following Sunday, at the Farben villa. Ambros agreed. FIAT planned its takedown. Plain clothes CIC officers would wait outside Villa Kohlhof, out of eyesight, until after Captain Edelsten placed Ambros under arrest.", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:Operation Paperclip_cleaned.txt:128:0cbda7c0bbda", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 6041, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "Operation Paperclip_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/031622104X", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "Operation Paperclip_cleaned", "chunk_index": 129, "text": "network in place as well.

Plain clothes CIC officers would wait outside Villa Kohlhof, out of eyesight, until after Captain Edelsten placed Ambros under arrest. Then they’d step in and transport the wanted war criminal back to Dustbin. Except Ambros was one step ahead. With his well established “private intelligence center complete with secretaries and errand boys,” he learned the meeting was a ruse to arrest him. When Edelsten arrived at the villa, Ambros’s secretary invited him inside. Smiling broadly, she apologized and said “Dr. Ambros is not able to come.” Edelsten feigned understanding and sat down at a large banquet table elegantly set for eight. The secretary whispered in his ear, “You have been at Gendorf,” as if to taunt him. Ambros, it turned out, had his own people following the FIAT agents who had been tailing him, a posse of “various deputies [between] Ludwigshafen and Gendorf.” Embarrassed and infuriated by the audacity of it all, Edelsten finished his tea and got up to leave. “Just as Edelsten was leaving, Ambros’s car pulled in (Chevrolet),” and for a fleeting moment Edelsten believed he would capture him after all. Instead, a look-alike “emerged from [the] car and said [Ambros] was unable to come.” Ambros had sent a double; Edelsten had been burned. FIAT was being made fun of, and there was little they could do. Captain Edelsten left the IG Farben villa red-faced and empty-handed. “Gave CIC description of Ambros’s car,” he noted in his report. “Light blue closed Saloon (Chevrolet).” Edelsten posted his men to watch the bridges around Heidelberg and promised to arrest Ambros if he ever arrived. But of course he never did. Adding insult to injury, the following day Dr. Otto Ambros sent Captain Edelsten a formal note, neatly typed on fancy stationery, with Farben’s wartime address still embossed on the letterhead. “Sorry that I could not make the appointment,” Ambros wrote. He signed his name in thick black ink. At Dustbin, Major Tilley continued to interrogate Ambros’s colleagues. In late August 1945, Tilley got a very lucky lead from Ambros’s former deputy, the Farben chemist Jürgen von Klenck. Von Klenck was back at Dustbin now, and under intense scrutiny after having been in attendance alongside Ambros at the meeting with Tarr and the representative from Dow Chemical, Wilhelm Hirschkind. Jürgen von Klenck had amassed a sizable Dustbin dossier of his own. A Nazi ideologue, von Klenck had been a loyal party member since 1933 and an officer with the SS since 1936.

One interrogator described him as “wily,” “untrustworthy,” and “not employable.” Von Klenck was also an elitist and had made more than a few enemies because of this. Speaking in confidence with Major Tilley, fellow chemist and Dustbin internee Wilhelm Horn candidly expressed his thought about Jürgen von Klenck. Von Klenck had a “magnetic presence, a brilliant mind, [was] handsome, polished and a wonderful talker, but lack[ed] the essential characteristics that would make him a truly great man,” said Horn. This was because von Klenck was “an egoist… very proud of the nobility implied in his name, and an opportunist who knew how to make the best of his chances.” Horn confirmed that von Klenck was a long-standing and avowed Nazi but that “it had always grated von Klenck’s pride that such common people as Hitler and his minions were in the highest places,” said Horn. Tilley asked Horn how high up von Klenck was in the production of war gases. Horn revealed that von Klenck had been deputy chief of the ultra-secret Committee-C for chemical weapons. In other words, Jürgen von Klenck was Otto Ambros’s right-hand man. Armed with this information, Major Tilley presented von Klenck with a piece of paper to sign. It was a declaration, “stating that he knew none of which had been concealed by others.” Von Klenck refused to sign. Tilley explained that withholding information was a crime. Threatened with arrest, von Klenck admitted that there were a few things he hadn’t been entirely truthful about. He told Major Tilley that in the late fall of 1944, Ambros had instructed him to destroy all paperwork regarding war gases, particularly the contracts between Farben and the Wehrmacht. Instead von Klenck had “carefully selected” a cache of important documents and secreted them away in a large steel drum. He had hired someone to bury the steel drum on a remote farm outside Gendorf. Where, exactly, von Klenck said he wasn’t sure. He told Tilley that he had “deliberately refused to learn where the [documents] were buried in order to be able to deny that he knew of any documents concealed anywhere.” He gave Major Tilley a list of possible hiding places. For two months Major Tilley searched the countryside around Gendorf for the steel drum, interviewing locals and patiently waiting for a solid lead. Finally, on October 27, 1945, he found what he’d been looking for.

Finally, on October 27, 1945, he found what he’d been looking for. During an interrogation with Gendorf’s fire chief, a man called Brandmeister Keller, the location was revealed. There was more. Brandmeister Keller had also hidden documents for Otto Ambros. “At first, Keller denied that he had secreted any documents,” read the FIAT report. “When he was told that his arrest order was in Major Tilley’s pocket he remembered four boxes Ambros had asked him to fetch in 1945.… Ambros gave him various barrels and boxes to hide with various farmers in Gendorf.” But the most important barrel, the large steel drum from von Klenck, had been “buried at the lonely farm of Lorenz Moser, near Burghausen.” Von Klenck’s hidden barrel produced hard evidence, including a letter from Ambros stating that he had been in charge of document destruction—and why. “All papers which prove our cooperation with Tabun and Sarin in the low-works, the DL-plant in the upper-work, must of course be destroyed or placed in security,” read one letter inside the drum, signed by Otto Ambros. It was attached to a stack of nerve agent contracts between Farben and Speer’s ministry, papers that von Klenck had been ordered to destroy. These contracts chronicled “full details of TABUN production and other details of DYHERNFURTH (now in Russian hands), including a detailed plan of all buildings and much or most of the apparatus… photographs and drawings… and many other valuable data, covering the period from 1938 or earlier until March 1945.” Now Major Tilley had two key pieces of evidence he had not had before. There was more damning information pertaining specifically to Otto Ambros that had been hidden in the steel drum. One document, written by Albert Speer, described two meetings with himself, Ambros, and Hitler in June 1944 which not only confirmed the high position that Ambros held but that he was a war profiteer. “I (SPEER) reported to the Führer that Dr. AMBROS of I.G. FARBEN had developed a new process by which Buna of the same quality as natural rubber can be produced. Some time in the future no further imports of natural rubber will be required… the Führer has ordered a donation of one million marks” to Ambros, Speer wrote. A final piece of evidence shined a light on Farben’s long-term plans for its business venture at Auschwitz. In addition to its Buna factory, IG Farben planned to produce chemical weapons at the death camp. The company had “plans for further construction of CW plant at AUSCHWITZ… in", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:Operation Paperclip_cleaned.txt:131:6beb4c676506", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 6044, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "Operation Paperclip_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/031622104X", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "Operation Paperclip_cleaned", "chunk_index": 132, "text": "rubber can be produced.

In addition to its Buna factory, IG Farben planned to produce chemical weapons at the death camp. The company had “plans for further construction of CW plant at AUSCHWITZ… in February 1945,” Tilley wrote in his FIAT report. Tilley returned to Dustbin with the steel drum and the documents. Von Klenck appeared shocked when Tilley told him that the steel drum had been located. “There are indications that he did not expect them to be found,” read Tilley’s intelligence report. FIAT now had documentary evidence that Ambros was “guilty of contravening American Military Government laws by concealing documents connected with German military preparations.” There were hundreds of documents, including “full data on Dyhernfurth, production sheets for Tabun and other war gases,” as well as “many other matters which [Ambros] claimed to have burned in the furnaces at Gendorf in April 1945. It may well be that these papers, added to the formulas, production methods, and the secret CW contracts between IG and the Reich from 1935 to 1945, which were discovered in a Gendorf safe on that same day, may give us a more complete picture of German CW preparations than of most other fields of German armament and general war production.” Major Tilley had pulled off a scientific intelligence coup d’état. Tilley took the information to a colleague, a veteran intelligence officer, who reminded him that there was an alternative theory to be considered regarding von Klenck. “Basing oneself on experience with enemy agents who confess plots freely, one may come to the conclusion that a lesser secret has been admitted to deflect the investigation from a more important secret,” the officer explained. Efforts to capture Ambros were redoubled. Two days after the steel drum find, on October 29, 1945, the British Intelligence Objectives Sub-committee issued a warrant for the “Arrest of Dr. Ambros.” Now there were two out of three Allied nations lobbying for the immediate arrest of Hitler’s favorite chemist. Otto Ambros was “dangerous” and “undesirable” and should not be “left at liberty,” read the arrest report. FIAT knew Ambros could remain protected as long as he stayed in the French zone. “He is wily and he will remain there as he knows the hunt for him is on in the U.S. Zone,” the report explained. There was little to do but wait. But patience again paid off. It took three months for Otto Ambros’s hubris to get the better of him.

On January 17, 1946, Ambros traveled outside the French zone and was arrested. He was sent to Dustbin, where Major Tilley was waiting to interrogate him. After FIAT squeezed him for information, Ambros was turned over to Colonel Burton Andrus, now commandant of the Nuremberg jail. Sometime in the foreseeable future Ambros would face judgment at Nuremberg. In the late summer of 1945, the Nazi scientist program underwent a significant organizational change. At the behest of the State-War-Navy Coordinating Committee, control over the program was removed from the Military Intelligence Division of the War Department, G-2, and given over to the Joint Chiefs of Staff. The newly created Joint Intelligence Objectives Agency (JIOA) would now be in charge of decision making for the rapidly expanding classified program. The JIOA was a subcommittee of the Joint Intelligence Committee, which provided national security information to the Joint Chiefs of Staff. To understand the JIOA’s power, and how it ran the Nazi scientist program so secretively, is to first understand the nature of the Joint Intelligence Committee. According to national security historian Larry A. Valero, who has written a monograph on the subject for the CIA, the JIC was and remains one of the most enigmatic of all the American intelligence agencies. “The JIC structure was always in motion, always morphing and changing, a flexible, ad-hoc system,” Valero says. “Subcommittees came and went, so did staff officers, but JIC decisions always had to be by consensus and were always reported to the Joint Chiefs.” Little has been written about the inner workings of the JIOA, but the stories of individual Nazi scientists, and the JIOA’s trail of partially declassified papers, help to define this powerful postwar organization. In the immediate aftermath of the German surrender, the Joint Intelligence Committee was focused on the emerging Soviet threat. Between June 15, 1945, and August 9, 1945, the JIC wrote and delivered sixteen major intelligence reports and twenty-seven policy papers to the Joint Chiefs. “The most important JIC estimates involved the military capabilities and future intentions of the USSR,” says Valero. Those intelligence estimates determined that the Soviets were ideologically hostile to the West and would continue to seek global domination, an attitude they had managed to skillfully conceal during the war. In September 1945, the JIC advised the Joint Chiefs that the Soviet Union would postpone “open conflict” with the West in the immediate future but only so it could rebuild its military arsenal and by 1952 be back at fighting strength. After this date, said the JIC, the Soviets", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:Operation Paperclip_cleaned.txt:133:1e8b5b10c817", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 6046, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "Operation Paperclip_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/031622104X", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "Operation Paperclip_cleaned", "chunk_index": 134, "text": "Those intelligence estimates determined that the Soviets were ideologically hostile to the West and would continue to seek global domination, an attitude they had managed to skillfully conceal during the war. In September 1945, the JIC advised the Joint Chiefs that the Soviet Union would postpone “open conflict” with the West in the immediate future but only so it could rebuild its military arsenal and by 1952 be back at fighting strength. After this date, said the JIC, the Soviets would be ready and able to engage the United States in “total war.” The following month, JIC intelligence report 250/4 (the fourth report in the JIC 250 series) warned the Joint Chiefs that “eight out of ten leading German scientists in the field of guided missiles” had recently gone missing from Germany, had most likely been captured by the Soviets, and were now at work in the USSR. Similarly threatening, noted the report, two German physics institutes had been seized by the Red Army and reassembled in the USSR—not just the laboratories and the libraries but the scientists as well. JIC 250/4 warned of “intensive Soviet scientific research programs” under way across Russia, all of which threatened the West. It was from within this environment of intense suspicion that the JIOA was created. The Nazi scientist program was an aggressive U.S. military program from the moment the JIOA took control, just a few weeks after two atomic bombs ended the war with Japan. The employment of German scientists was specifically and strategically aimed at achieving military supremacy over the Soviet Union before the Soviet Union was able to dominate the United States. Attaining supreme military power meant marshaling all the cutting-edge science and technology that could be culled from the ruins of the Reich. In the eyes of military intelligence, the fact that the scientists happened to be Nazis was incidental—a troublesome detail. It had no bearing on the bigger plan. The clock was ticking and, according to the Joint Intelligence Committee, would likely run out sometime around 1952. There was language in the existing Nazi scientist policy that now had to be dealt with by the JIOA. The phrase “no known or alleged war criminal” could not remain as part of policy nomenclature for long, nor could the phrase “no ardent Nazis.” These words had been put there to appease a few generals in the Pentagon, certain individuals in the State Department and moralists like Dr. H. P. Robertson, General Eisenhower’s chief of scientific intelligence. For the program to move forward according to this new strategy, the language needed to change. With the Joint Intelligence Objectives Agency now in control, a new, aggressive recruitment process would begin.

On its governing body, the JIOA had one representative of each member agency of the Joint Intelligence Committee: the army’s director of intelligence, the chief of naval intelligence, the assistant chief of Air Staff-2 (air force intelligence), and a representative from the State Department. The diplomat in the group was outnumbered by the military officers three to one. The State Department officer assigned to the JIOA was Samuel Klaus, and he was perceived by his JIOA colleagues to be a troublemaker from day one. Samuel Klaus was a forty-two-year-old shining star in the State Department, a brilliant lawyer, avid horseman, and Hebrew scholar who also spoke Russian and German. Because Klaus was the man on the JIOA who was in charge of approving the visas for all incoming German scientists, it was important that he be on board with what the JIOA wanted to accomplish. But Samuel Klaus was fundamentally opposed to the Nazi scientist program, and this created intense conflict within the JIOA. Klaus had hands-on experience with Nazi Party ideology, owing to his wartime work for the U.S. Foreign Economic Administration during the war. During the war, Klaus ran Operation Safe Haven, a program with international reach designed to capture Nazi assets, including stolen art and gold being smuggled out of Germany for safekeeping in neutral countries. During his years running Safe Haven, Klaus had interviewed hundreds of German civilians, and he had developed the belief that many “ordinary Germans” had profited from the Nazi Party and had had a tacit understanding of what was happening to the Jews. In his role as the State Department representative on the JIOA, Klaus argued that the Germans at issue were not brilliant scientists who had been unwittingly caught in a maelstrom of evil but rather that they were amoral opportunists of mediocre talent. JIOA records indicate that Klaus’s sentiments were shared by at least two of his State Department colleagues, including Herbert Cummings and Howard Travers. But it was Samuel Klaus who was unabashedly vocal about how he felt and what he believed. At a JIOA meeting in the late fall of 1945, Klaus vowed that “less than a dozen [German scientists] would ever be permitted to enter the U.S.” on his watch. For this, he was seen as a thorn in the side of military intelligence and he was also outnumbered. Per the JIOA’s charter, it was required to share its plan with a cabinet-level advisory board, which included a representative from the Department of Commerce.

As it so happened, the representative from the After the war in Europe ended, President Truman put the Department of Commerce in charge of a program designed to excite the nation about a unique form of reparations being culled from the defeated German state, namely, the acquisition of scientific and technical information. There would be no financial compensation coming from Nazi Germany, the Department of Commerce explained, but American industry could now benefit from a different kind of restitution: knowledge. Secretary of Commerce (and former vice president) Henry Wallace had been appointed by the president to supervise the release of thousands of what would become known as PB reports, named after the Commerce Department’s Office of the Publication Board. These reports contained non-armamentsrelated information collected by CIOS officers in Germany after the war. The idea behind the PB reports was to get average Americans to start their own small businesses inspired by German technological advances. These new businesses would be a boon to America’s postwar prosperity, the Commerce Department said. Thanks to Reich scientists, the public was told, beverage manufactures could now sterilize fruit juice without heat. Women could enjoy run-proof hosiery. Butter could be churned at the rate of 1,500 pounds per hour. These lists seemed not to end. Yeast could be produced in unlimited quantities, and wool could be pulled from sheepskins without injuring the animal’s hide—all because of brilliant German scientists. Hitler’s wizards had reduced suitcase-sized electrical components to the size of a pinkie finger and pioneered electromagnetic tape. Henry Wallace was one of the nation’s greatest champions of the idea that Americans could find prosperity thanks to science. Wallace had served under Roosevelt in 1944, when Roosevelt promised Americans sixty million jobs. The promise became the subject of a book by Wallace: Sixty Million Jobs. As secretary of commerce, he intended to make good on it. Business, industry, and government could work together to make the world prosperous in peace, Wallace said. German science was a jumping-off point. The public was not made aware of a second list regarding captured German scientific and technical information, one marked classified. This list catalogued eighteen hundred reports on German technology with military potential. Subject headings included: “rockets,” “chemical warfare,” “medical practice,” “aeronautics,” “ordnance,” “insecticides,” and “physics, nuclear.” The man in charge of both lists—the classified and the unclassified one—was Henry Wallace’s executive secretary and his representative on the JIOA, John C. Green. Regarding the classified list, Green got an idea.

Green. Regarding the classified list, Green got an idea. Peace and prosperity were, in principle, sound ideas. But there was big business in war. Green wanted to make the classified list available to certain groups in industry. “Specialized knowledge [should not be] locked up in the minds of German scientists and technicians,” Green said. It needed to be shared. To help foster this sharing, in the fall of 1945 John C. Green traveled to Wright Field, in Dayton, Ohio, to meet with Colonel Donald Putt. The first group of six Germans brought to Wright Field in the fall of 1945 lived in an isolated and secure housing area called the Hilltop, a cluster of five single-story wooden buildings and three small cottages that had once housed the National Youth Administration. Almost no one but the program’s administrators knew that the German scientists were there. There was a single-lane dirt road that passed by the Hilltop, used only by locals who needed to visit the town dump. Trucks and station wagons filled with trash sped by the Hilltop’s secret inhabitants, and when it rained the road turned into a sea of mud. This annoyed the Germans, and they began compiling a list of grievances to share with Colonel Putt at a later date. They knew better than to complain just yet. Considering the fate and circumstances of many of their colleagues back in Germany, theirs was a particularly good deal. But when the timing was right they would share this list of indignities, which would in turn affect the Nazi scientist program in the most unusual way. The original scientists at Wright Field were listed as Dr. Gerhard Braun, motor research; Dr. Theodor Zobel, aerodynamics; and Dr. Rudolph Edse, rocket fuels; the specialists were Mr. Otto Bock, supersonics; Mr. Hans Rister, aerodynamics; and Mr. Albert Patin, a businessman. Their salaries averaged $12, 480 a year, plus a $600 per diem—the equivalent of about $123, 400 in 2013. Because of an “oversight,” later caught and corrected, the Germans did not pay U.S. taxes for the first two years and twenty months of the program. At the Hilltop, a husband-and-wife team of housekeepers looked after the Germans’ domestic needs, washed their laundry, and made their beds. German prisoners of war who had already been brought to the United States and were not yet repatriated acted as cooks.

The six scientists and specialists and the others who would soon follow carried military-issue identification cards that had a large green “S” stamped on the front, indicating that they were not allowed to leave the base on their own. A gate running around the perimeter of the Hilltop was to be locked from 5:00 p.m. to 7:00 a.m. each night. On weekends, U.S. Army intelligence officers escorted the Germans into Dayton, where they could exercise at the local YMCA. A priest was brought in from Cincinnati to deliver Sunday mass in German. “We would like you to know and to appreciate that you are here in the interest of science and we hope that you will work with us in close harmony to further develop and expand your various subjects of interest,” read the introductory pamphlet issued to each specialist at Wright Field. “We have tried to make you comfortable in the quarters assigned to you.” What the Germans craved most was respect, and this eluded them. During the war Hitler’s scientists and industrialists had been treated with great admiration by the Reich. Most scientists enjoyed financial reward. But here at Wright Field, many of the Germans’ American counterparts looked down on them with disdain. “The mere mention of a German scientist is enough to precipitate emotions in Air Corp personnel ranging from vehemence to frustration,” one manager stated in an official classified report. As commanding general for intelligence at Wright Field, Colonel Donald Putt was in charge of the German specialist program. Putt had great admiration for each of the scientists, having handpicked almost every one of them in Germany, at the Hermann Göring Aeronautical Research Center at Völkenrode, and elsewhere. He could not fathom why the specialists were looked upon with contempt. “[A]ll they wanted was an opportunity to work,” Putt said. Colonel Putt’s vision for the Germans’ workload in America was threefold. Initially, he planned for the men to write reports on their past and future work. Next, those reports would be translated and circulated among American engineers at Wright Field. Then Air Technical Service Command would hold research and development seminars at Wright Field, with invitations sent out to defense contractors, university laboratories, and any other interested parties with Top Secret clearance and a contract with the Army Air Forces. But Putt’s idea came to a grinding halt after the War Department weighed in on his proposal, responding to what it called “calculated risk.” The German scientist program was a highly classified military program and", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:Operation Paperclip_cleaned.txt:138:357447e88bb2", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 6051, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "Operation Paperclip_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/031622104X", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "Operation Paperclip_cleaned", "chunk_index": 139, "text": "American engineers at Wright Field.

But Putt’s idea came to a grinding halt after the War Department weighed in on his proposal, responding to what it called “calculated risk.” The German scientist program was a highly classified military program and needed to remain secret. A War Department memo required that the Germans remain “properly segregated from persons not directly concerned with their exploitation.” There was to be no fraternizing with American scientists. Collaboration with defense contractors and others was impossible at this point in the program. The German specialists were offended by the way they were treated. Word from Dr. Herbert Wagner, inventor of the Hs 293 missile, was that Gould Castle on Long Island, where Wagner resided and worked, had marble bathtubs. Naval Intelligence allowed their German scientists to take field trips into Manhattan. The Germans at Wright Field told Putt they felt like “caged animals,” and they demanded that something be done about it. Putt saw opportunity here. He wrote to Army Intelligence, G-2, to say that the Germans’ overall malaise was “critically affecting” their ability to work. When the Pentagon ignored Putt’s concerns, he appealed to Major Hugh Knerr, his commanding general at Air Technical Service Command. Knerr wrote to the Pentagon. “Intangibles of a scientist’s daily life directly affect the quality of his product,” he said, but this too had little effect. In Washington the general feeling was that Operation Overcast was temporary and that the Germans should be happy to have jobs. Besides, the Nuremberg trials were about to begin. On October 18, 1945, an indictment was lodged by the International Military Tribunal against the defendants named as major war criminals. The trial would take place inside the east wing of the Nuremberg Palace of Justice, with opening statements beginning November 20. Because this was a military tribunal, sentences would be passed by judges, not jurors. Nuremberg as a city had played a unique role in the rise of the Nazi Party. It had been the site of Hitler’s Nazi Party rallies—colossal military parades supported by as many as 400,000 Nazi loyalists—and home to the Nuremberg race laws. Now the leaders in the regime would be tried in this location for conspiracy, crimes against peace, war crimes, and crimes against humanity. As the trial began, twenty-one defendants sat crammed onto two benches, inside Courtroom 600, headphones over their ears. (There were twenty-two defendants; Martin Bormann was tried in absentia.) Behind them on the wall, symbolically positioned over their heads, was a large marble statue of the hideous monster Medusa.

Behind them on the wall, symbolically positioned over their heads, was a large marble statue of the hideous monster Medusa. The twenty-one present faced the death penalty if convicted. “The wrongs which we seek to condemn and punish have been so calculated, so malignant, and so devastating,” Chief U.S. Prosecutor Justice Robert H. Jackson famously declared, “that civilization cannot tolerate their being ignored, because it cannot survive their being repeated.” The trial would last almost a year. With stories about Nuremberg and the Nazi war crimes dominating world news, complaints about comfort from the Germans at Wright Field meant very little to the War Department General Staff. The same month the Nuremberg trial opened, in October 1945, the Army Air Forces hosted a grand two-day-long fair at Wright Field. On display were captured German and Japanese aircraft and rockets seen by the public for the first time since war’s end. Over half a million people from twentysix countries came to marvel at the confiscated enemy equipment, said to be worth $150 million. Among the items on display were the V-2 rocket, the Focke-Wulf Fw 190 G3 fighter aircraft, and the Messerschmitt Me 262. Particularly fascinating to the public was that some of the airplanes still had swastikas painted on their tails. The fair was so popular that the Army Air Forces extended it for five days. There was no mention made of the fact that several of the men who had designed and engineered these weapons were living a stone’s throw away, at the Hilltop. Among the half-million visitors at the fair was John C. Green, the Commerce Department’s representative on the JIOA advisory board and its executive secretary overseeing the PB reports. The board had just changed its name to the Office of Technical Services, underscoring its transformation from a passive “board” to a more active “service” that would make use of cutting-edge science and technology. As planned, Green tracked down Colonel Putt at the Wright Field Fair. He had a myriad o f questions for Putt, all of which centered around one idea: How could all this science and technology on display benefit American industry moving forward? Initially, Putt was uneasy about Green’s attention, but in the end he decided to take a gamble on him. After all, John C. Green had access to the classified list. Putt shared with him some information about the German scientists on the Hilltop.

How they were like men kept in an ivory tower, how their talents were squandered by policy and prejudice in some circles in Washington, D.C. They needed employment opportunities, Putt lamented. Perhaps Green could help? Green seemed amenable, and Putt took note. “During his visit to the Air Forces Fair, Wright Field, [John C. Green] evidenced keen interest and inquired as to the reaction of industry toward the possible employment of German scientists,” Putt wrote in a memo. He was not yet clear if Green’s “influence is favorable or unfavorable.” But Putt decided to take the risk. He forwarded to Green several “letters of interest” from defense contractors regarding potential employment of the German scientists. These documents had already been received by Air Material Command. They included letters from Dow Chemical Company, the AiResearch Manufacturing Company, and the Aircraft Industries Association. Defense contracts meant that there was business in the wings waiting to be transacted. It was Washington, D.C., that stood in the way. Putt explained to Green that these private businesses did not have a high enough security clearance to deal directly with the German scientists themselves. John C. Green wrote to JIOA explaining what he had in mind: German scientists of “international repute” should be allowed, with their families, to enter the United States for long-term work, argued Green. This was good for American businesses. The letters from the defense contractors indicated that there was a great demand for this kind of work. The Commerce Department would set up a board to weed out the Nazis and bring the good Germans in. The German scientists’ knowledge and knowhow would be “fully and freely” available to all Americans, said Green. This boom to industry would help create tens of thousands of American jobs. Inside the JIOA, reactions were mixed, particularly among advisory board members. The assistant secretary of the interior was skeptical as to how Commerce could guarantee to keep old Nazis out of the program. The War Department did not like the idea of having to bring the families to America. Army Intelligence felt Green’s proposal had validity from an economic perspective. If Commerce got involved in the German scientist program, the army would not necessarily have to shoulder so much of the financial burden. The State Department continued to voice objections, saying that regardless of who footed the bill, visas were not going to be granted to former enemies of the state without thorough and individual investigations.

The Nazi scientist program was a temporary military program, State said. Nothing more. John C. Green had an alternative plan. Instead of arguing his case further to the JIOA advisory board, he appealed to his boss, Henry Wallace. In turn, Henry Wallace wrote directly to President Truman, requesting that the president support the German science program. Science would help create those sixty million jobs, Wallace said, and nothing had a higher national priority in peacetime than American jobs. It was “wise and logical” to bring to America “scientists of outstanding attainments who can make a positive contribution to our scientific and industrial efforts,” Wallace wrote to President Truman on December 4, 1945. The knowledge these men possessed, Wallace said, “if added to our own would advance the frontiers of scientific knowledge for national benefit.” To illustrate his point, Wallace used one of the most benign scientists in all of Germany, a concrete and road construction expert named Dr. O. Graff, who had helped design the autobahn. “If you agree that the importance of a selected few (approximately 50 in number) would be an asset to our economy, I suggest you declare that this to be U.S. policy,” Wallace urged the president. For Colonel Donald Putt at Wright Field and the military intelligence members of the JIOA, Henry Wallace’s endorsement of the program was like a shot in the arm. Before Wallace’s letter to the president, Samuel Klaus of the State Department had suggested that the public would be outraged by the program once they found out about it. It could not stay secret forever, nor was it meant to. Klaus had said that bringing Hitler’s former scientists to America for weapons research and development gave the impression that the army and the navy were willing to make deals with the devil for national security gains. Henry Wallace’s economically minded endorsement changed all that. It gave the German scientists program an air of democracy, offering counterbalance to what could be perceived as an aggressive military program. Henry Wallace had been staunchly anti-Nazi during the war. Preceding Truman in the vice presidency, Wallace had publicly called Hitler a “supreme devil operating through a human form.” In another famous speech, he had likened Hitler to Satan seven times. That Henry Wallace was encouraging President Truman to endorse the German scientist program in the name of economic prosperity gave Operation Overcast a future. Henry Wallace was exactly what the JIOA had been waiting for.

Henry Wallace was exactly what the JIOA had been waiting for. On November 4, 1945, a headline in the Washington Post caught the nation’s attention: “Army Uncovers Lurid Nazi ‘Science’ of Freezing Men.” The article, written by reporter George Connery, was a major news scoop. In an effort to garner support for subsequent military trials in Nuremberg, the War Department had leaked to Connery the secret CIOS report written by war crimes investigator Dr. Leo Alexander. The report chronicled the freezing experiments conducted at Dachau inside Experimental Cell Block Five. That human beings had been tortured to death by German physicians in the name of medical science was both horrifying and incomprehensible to most Americans. The Post article revealed that the only man believed to have survived the freezing experiments had been located by Dr. Leo Alexander. Most of the other victims—the so-called Untermenschen whom the Nazi doctors had experimented on—died in the process or were killed. It was likely that this sole surviving victim, a Catholic priest, would provide witness testimony in the Nuremberg courts. Americans were rapt. Kept secret from the public was an astonishing hypocrisy. Less than 150 miles from the Nuremberg courtroom, several of the physicians who had participated in, and many others who were accessory to, these criminal medical experiments were now being employed by the U.S. Army at the Army Air Forces Aero Medical Center, the classified research facility in Heidelberg. This laboratory, dreamed up by Colonel Harry Armstrong and Major General Malcolm Grow at a meeting in France in the spring of 1945, would remain one of the best-kept secrets of Operation Paperclip for decades to come. Here, starting on September 20, 1945, fifty-eight doctors handpicked by Dr. Strughold had been working on medical research projects begun for the Third Reich. Some of the data the Nazi doctors were using in their new Army research had been obtained in experiments in which test subjects had been murdered. For Grow and Armstrong, the plan was to have these Luftwaffe doctors reconfigure the results of their war work in Heidelberg under army supervision. The follow-on plan was for these doctors to come to the United States under Paperclip contracts. Because conducting military research inside Germany was a violation of Allied Control Council Law 25 of the Potsdam Accord, the Aero Medical Center’s classified nature shielded the Nazi doctors from chance exposure. The codirectors of the secret research facility, Colonel Harry Armstrong and Dr. Hubertus Strughold, were alike in many ways, so much so that some saw the two men as", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:Operation Paperclip_cleaned.txt:143:491b072f110d", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 6056, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "Operation Paperclip_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/031622104X", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "Operation Paperclip_cleaned", "chunk_index": 144, "text": "under army supervision.

The codirectors of the secret research facility, Colonel Harry Armstrong and Dr. Hubertus Strughold, were alike in many ways, so much so that some saw the two men as mirror images of one another. The growing success of the Aero Medical Center would prove to be a launching point for each man’s meteoric postwar career. Armstrong would eventually be promoted to U.S. surgeon general of the air force. Strughold would become the father of U.S. space medicine. Harry Armstrong, born in 1899, entered into the U.S. military when horses were still being ridden into battle. During World War I Armstrong learned how to drive a six-mule ambulance and decided to become a doctor. After receiving his medical degree from the University of Louisville, he opened a private practice in Minneapolis. He might have become a country doctor, but he was preoccupied by airplanes and dirigibles. Appointed first lieutenant in the Medical Corps Reserve, Armstrong entered the School of Aviation Medicine (SAM) at Brooks Field, in San Antonio, Texas, in 1924. In 1925 he decided to specialize in a field of medicine few had ever heard of, and soon he would become a flight surgeon. He had never flown in an airplane before. It was a master sergeant named Erwin H. Nickles who inspired Armstrong to make his first parachute jump. In a lecture that took place in a parachute hangar, Nickles presented the idea that one day entire troops of infantrymen just might jump out of airplanes into combat situations as a group. After the class was over, Armstrong got in a long conversation with Nickles. “He told me that he was puzzled by the fact that people who he supervised in practice jumps almost invariably failed to follow his instruction which was to count ten after leaving the airplane before pulling the rip cord,” Armstrong explained. He said that Nickles feared jumpers would “black out or get into a panic and pull the rip cord too quickly.” When Nickles “hinted that he would be very happy if some doctor would make a jump to see if they could solve his problem,” Armstrong’s mind was made up. “I decided I would make a practice jump and delay my opening as long as possible.” A few weeks later Armstrong was standing in the cockpit of a biplane, wearing a flying suit and a gabardine helmet and getting ready to jump. “I had a feeling of panic,” Armstrong explained, but he hurled himself out of the aircraft anyway.

As he fell through the air he kept his eyes closed and paid attention to what his body felt like as he descended. The feeling of panic disappeared, he later recalled. He did not lose consciousness or black out. Armstrong allowed himself to free-fall for approximately twelve hundred feet before he finally pulled the ripcord. His parachute opened and he floated the last one thousand feet to earth, where he landed in a grassy Texas field. Harry Armstrong had set a U.S. Army record. He was the first flight surgeon to make a free fall from an aircraft. When Armstrong arrived with his family at Wright Field, in 1934, the world was enamored with airplanes, which were not yet associated with war but with peacetime progress and the spirit of adventure. Jimmy Doolittle set a transcontinental record flying from California to New Jersey in eleven hours, sixteen minutes. Wiley Post and Harold Gatty circled the globe in eight days. At Wright Field, the primary task of the flight surgeon was determining who was physically fit to fly in the airplanes of the day. Armstrong was a man with a vision and he was also a soldier. He envisioned a future where wars would be fought in the air. The Army Air Corps’ most advanced fighter aircraft was a biplane with a speed of around 200 miles per hour and a flight ceiling of 18,000 feet. Armstrong’s work centered around resolving problems related to oxygen deprivation and exposure to cold. One day Armstrong spotted a trapdoor in the floor of his office inside Building 16 at Wright Field. He opened the door, saw a staircase, and climbed down. He found himself in a basement filled with old machinery and drafting tables. An unusual-looking chamber, like something out of a novel by Jules Verne, caught his eye. It was shaped like a globe, made of iron, and had windows like submarine portholes. This was the army’s first and only low-pressure chamber, built decades earlier for its World War I flight surgeon school. The school, located in Mineola, Long Island, had closed down after the war and the chamber had wound up here, at Wright Field. Armstrong got an idea. Next door to his office, Army Air Forces engineers were designing airplanes that could fly faster, higher, and farther than ever before. Armstrong wanted to begin research and development on the medical effects that flying these new airplanes would have on pilots. He wrote a letter", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:Operation Paperclip_cleaned.txt:145:5bc407d9b27f", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 6058, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "Operation Paperclip_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/031622104X", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "Operation Paperclip_cleaned", "chunk_index": 146, "text": "its World War I flight surgeon school.

Next door to his office, Army Air Forces engineers were designing airplanes that could fly faster, higher, and farther than ever before. Armstrong wanted to begin research and development on the medical effects that flying these new airplanes would have on pilots. He wrote a letter to the engineering division at Wright Field requesting permission. The letter was forwarded to Washington. In no time, Armstrong was appointed director of the Physiological Research Unit (later called the Aero Medical Research Laboratory and other variations on the name) at Wright Field. His lab took off. Shop mechanics built test chambers from old airplane parts. He hired a scientist from Harvard, a PhD named John “Bill” Heim. Using volunteer test subjects, Heim and Armstrong gathered data on how the body responds to speed, lower oxygen levels, and decompression sickness and extreme temperatures. But it was an experiment on himself, with a rabbit on his lap, for which Armstrong became legendary. He had been wondering what really happened to the human body above 10,000 feet. Why, and at what specific height, would a man die? Armstrong climbed into the low-pressure chamber with the rabbit on his lap. His technician adjusted the pressure to simulate high altitude. Armstrong’s chest began to tighten and his joints hurt. When he rubbed his hands, he felt tiny bubbles along his tendons, ones that he could move around under his skin. He surmised that these were nitrogen bubbles forming in his blood and tissues, and that death at high altitude was caused by blood clotting. Armstrong indicated to the technician that he should simulate an even higher altitude inside the chamber. He was wearing an oxygen mask, but the rabbit on his lap was not. Soon the rabbit would be dead. As the lab technician raised the pressure, the rabbit convulsed and died. When Armstrong got out of the chamber, he dissected the rabbit and found nitrogen bubbles, proving that his hypothesis was correct. Armstrong’s discovery gave way to a major milestone in aviation medicine. Working with Heim on more tests, he inserted a viewing tube into the artery of a test animal. The two men took data on what happens to a mammal’s body at forty thousand, fifty thousand, and finally sixty-five thousand feet. They were the first to witness that body fluids boil at sixty-three thousand feet. This point would become known as the Armstrong line. This is the altitude beyond which humans cannot survive without a pressure suit. In 1937, Captain Harry Armstrong was considered one of America’s aviation medicine pioneers.

On October 2 of that year he attended the Aero Medical Association’s first international convention, which took place in the Astor Gallery of the Waldorf-Astoria hotel. There, he and Heim reported the results of their recent studies at Wright Field. One of the doctors most interested in these studies was the Luftwaffe physician representing Germany, Dr. Hubertus Strughold. The two men, Armstrong and Strughold, were pioneers in the same field. “We hit it off immediately,” remembered Harry Armstrong decades later. That fortuitous meeting would profoundly shape Strughold’s post-Nazi career. Some men claim to be shaped by a single event. For Hubertus Strughold, it was watching Halley’s Comet streak across the sky from his backyard tree house in Westtünnen, Germany, in 1910. Forever after, said Strughold, he became preoccupied with what lies above. That same year, a second event shaped the rest of his life. Strughold watched a solar eclipse through a viewing glass and nearly went blind. The lens wasn’t as dark as he thought it was and he burned the retina of his right eye, causing permanent damage. “When I looked at somebody with the right eye, at his nose, he had no nose.… When I looked at somebody at the street, at a distance of about a hundred meters at somebody’s head [with the right eye], he did not have any head. It was always clear with both eyes,” Strughold later explained. Hubertus Strughold had learned the hard way that experiments using one’s own body could be dangerous. Still, as a young man, he pursued auto-experimentation with vigor and imagination. In college he studied physics, anatomy, and zoology, but it was physiology that interested him most, the functions of living organisms and their parts. At the University of Würzburg Strughold taught the world’s first college course on the effects high altitude had on the human body. His experimental test data came from himself. On weekends he flew hot air balloons, recording everything from vision to ear pressure to muscle effects. Inside the flying balloon, Professor Strughold recorded how his body responded to rapid acceleration and descent, which in turn made him curious to know how he would feel during radical banking turns.

For that he needed an airplane. Strughold found the perfect mentor in a World War I flying ace by the name of Robert Ritter von Greim. Von Greim was a legend. Renowned for his fearlessness in battle, in World War I he had recorded twenty-eight kills. In the 1920s and 1930s he was considered one of the top pilots in Germany and performed a variety of flight-related jobs, including exhibition dogfights against fellow World War I flying ace Ernst Udet. When Adolf Hitler needed a pilot to fly him from Munich to Berlin for the Kapp Putsch coup attempt in 1920, he chose Robert Ritter von Greim for the job. In 1926, von Greim was hired by Chiang Kai-shek to set up the Chinese air force in Canton, China. Returning to Germany, von Greim opened a flight school, located at the top of a mountain in Galgenberg, two miles from where Hubertus Strughold taught aviation medicine to college students. Strughold hired von Greim to teach him how to fly, paying him six marks per lesson. The two men became fast friends. In Robert Ritter von Greim, Hubertus Strughold found a brilliant match—another man willing to push pilot performance to the edge of unconsciousness. The men would strap themselves into harnesses in von Greim’s open cockpit airplane and fly loops and rolls in the skies over Galgenberg. Strughold kept track of their physiological reactions to extreme flight, seeking answers to questions. Can a man draw a straight line while flying upside down? Can a pilot mark a bull’s-eye on a piece of paper immediately after a barrel roll? With how little oxygen could a man legibly write his name? How far up can a man fly before his vision fades? Von Greim was challenged by Strughold’s strange requests, and he was willing to fly faster and higher as his new young physician friend recorded data on von Greim’s pilot performance and physical capabilities in the air. Strughold knew his tests were original and hoped they would attract interest from the United States. In 1928 his wish came true when he received a prestigious fellowship from the Rockefeller Foundation. Strughold packed his bags, boarded the SS Dresden, and headed to New York. Hubertus Strughold took to America like a fish to water, he later explained. As a Rockefeller Foundation fellow at the University of Chicago, he was at the center of the music scene in the roaring twenties. Listening to jazz music was his favorite pastime after flying.

His thick German accent distinguished him from everyone else around and made most people remember him. His first scientific paper in English was on oxygen deficiency and how to revive a heart using electric shock. For research he used dogs as test subjects, importing them from Canada at a time when experimenting on dogs from the United States was illegal. Strughold attended conferences in Boston and visited the laboratories at Harvard, at the Mayo Clinic in Minnesota, and at Columbia University in New York. And he met and became friendly with American aviation medicine pioneers like Harry Armstrong. The Rockefeller fellowship lasted only a year. Back in Germany, Strughold and von Greim took up where they left off. Von Greim was now flying a double-decker Udet Flamingo aircraft, an aerobatic sports biplane made of wood. To determine how many g-forces a man could take before his eyeballs suffered damage, the two men would climb high in the air, then dive down toward the ground until one of them blacked out. Von Greim’s longtime friend and colleague Adolf Hitler took power in 1933. In secret, von Greim was called upon by Hermann Göring to rebuild the German Air Force, in violation of the Treaty of Versailles. Through his personal friendship with von Greim, Strughold ingratiated himself into this inner circle of Nazi power. In 1935 he was offered a job that would shape the rest of his life. As director of the Aviation Medical Research Institute of the Reich Air Ministry in Berlin, he was now in the uppermost echelon of Luftwaffe medical research. The lab, located in the suburb of Charlottenburg, featured a state-of-the-art low-pressure chamber and a ten-foot centrifuge in which test subjects could be exposed to varying degrees of gravitational pull. The chamber could take both apes and humans to between fifteen and twenty Gs. The job required time, commitment, and most of all dedication. The Reich needed the Luftwaffe to help conquer all of Europe. This was why Strughold had packed his bags and moved to Berlin. He would report directly to Erich Hippke, chief of the Luftwaffe’s medical corps, who reported to Hermann Göring. This was a vertical career move for Strughold. He’d gone from a university teaching post to the top of the Reich’s aviation medicine chain of command. The Reich had vast resources and a desire to conduct groundbreaking experiments for the benefit of its pilots. There were risks but with risks came rewards. For Strughold, the reward was monumental.

He’d gone from a university teaching post to the top of the Reich’s aviation medicine chain of command. The Reich had vast resources and a desire to conduct groundbreaking experiments for the benefit of its pilots. There were risks but with risks came rewards. For Strughold, the reward was monumental. For ten years he enjoyed a career as one of the most powerful physicians working for the Third Reich. In Berlin, Strughold treated his expansive new laboratory as a haven for risk takers. Colleagues, including officials from the Nazi Party and the SS, would stop by to marvel over his work with the low-pressure chamber and the centrifuge. Experiments were almost always in progress. Strughold’s medical assistants were forever allowing themselves to be hooked up to these odd-looking contraptions with pipes, valves, and hoses projecting from all sides. Assistants, one with and one without an oxygen mask, would allow themselves to be locked inside the low-pressure chamber in order to determine how high up a man could go before becoming unconscious. During one experiment, two officials with the Reich Air Ministry were on hand to observe. The man without the oxygen mask began to lose consciousness. First his eyes closed, then his head fell to his chest. The second man inside the chamber, wearing a mask, administered first aid. It did not take long for the man to quickly recover. As the Luftwaffe prepared its pilots for war, Strughold continued to use his staff as test subjects. He also experimented on himself. He was said to have “ridden the centrifuge” for a full two minutes, simulating what it would be like to experience fifteen times the force of gravity while flying an airplane. After Germany invaded Poland in September 1939, the war spread into areas of extreme climates, from Norway to North Africa to the Russian front. These new combat theaters created urgent new medical problems for the Reich, most notably for foot soldiers but also for the Luftwaffe. As the war progressed and the Luftwaffe unveiled one new airplane after the next, the pilot physiology challenges grew. By 1940 new engine systems were being developed, including turbo and jet engines, with countless pilot parameters to explore, including the effects of speed, lower oxygen levels, decompression sickness, and extreme temperatures on the body. A web of institutions sprang up across Germany and its newly conquered lands, all financed by the deep pockets of the Reich Research Council, and including Strughold’s Aviation Medical Research Institute in Berlin. The institute worked hand in hand with two Luftwaffe facilities close by, and Strughold developed strong relationships with the director of each institute: Dr. Theodor Benzinger, of the Experimental Station of the Air Force Research Center at", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:Operation Paperclip_cleaned.txt:150:1c317ffd2001", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 6063, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "Operation Paperclip_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/031622104X", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "Operation Paperclip_cleaned", "chunk_index": 151, "text": "oxygen levels, decompression sickness, and extreme temperatures on the body. A web of institutions sprang up across Germany and its newly conquered lands, all financed by the deep pockets of the Reich Research Council, and including Strughold’s Aviation Medical Research Institute in Berlin. The institute worked hand in hand with two Luftwaffe facilities close by, and Strughold developed strong relationships with the director of each institute: Dr. Theodor Benzinger, of the Experimental Station of the Air Force Research Center at Rechlin, and Dr. Siegfried Ruff, of the German Experimental Station for Aviation Medicine, Aero Medical division, in Berlin. This is why, after the war, when Strughold was asked by Colonel Armstrong to be the codirector of the classified AAF Aero Medical facility in Heidelberg, Strughold asked Benzinger and Ruff to come along. He put each man in charge of one of the four areas of aviation research at the new facility. They trusted one another. They all had the same secrets to protect. Dr. Theodor Benzinger was tall, thin as a rail, 5^(′)11^(′′) and just 138 pounds. He had dark blue eyes, sharp, angular features, and kept his black hair slicked back, with a pencil part. Born in 1905, Benzinger was described, in his army intelligence dossier, as “an old school Prussian, willful, selfserving and willing to get what he wants by any means.” At Heidelberg he was put in charge of a department that developed oxygen equipment for airplanes. Benzinger was a committed Nazi and had been from the earliest days of National Socialism. He joined the Nazi Party the year Hitler took power, in 1933. He was also a member of the SA, holding the position of medical sergeant major. He and his wife, Ilse Benzinger, were members of the NSV, the Nazi Party’s so-called social welfare organization, which was overseen by Reich propaganda minister Joseph Goebbels. Ilse was active in NSV-sponsored programs like Mother and Child, whereby unwed German mothers could birth Aryan children on bucolic baby farms. In 1934, the twenty-nine-year-old Dr. Benzinger was made department chief of the Experimental Station of the Air Force Research Center. Like Harry Armstrong, Benzinger predicted that pilots would fly high-altitude missions to sixty thousand feet sometime in the near future. In service of this idea Benzinger and his staff at Rechlin researched high-altitude durability and explosive decompression. They took great risks experimenting on themselves. On one occasion, one of Benzinger’s technicians died as a result of complications from oxygen deprivation experienced inside a low-pressure chamber. In addition to researching aviation medicine, Benzinger became a pilot and served as a colonel in the Luftwaffe. He flew reconnaissance and combat missions over the British Isles. In 1939, showing “bravery before the enemy” Benzinger was awarded the Iron Cross, Class I and Class II.

In 1939, showing “bravery before the enemy” Benzinger was awarded the Iron Cross, Class I and Class II. In Heidelberg, at the Army Air Forces Aero Medical Center, Strughold put Dr. Siegfried Ruff in charge of work involving the effect g-forces have on human beings. This was work that Ruff had begun at the test center in Rechlin with Dr. Benzinger during the war. Ruff did not have the same striking looks as his colleague, Dr. Benzinger. Ruff’s smiling, professorial posture made it hard to imagine he had spent so much time supervising medical experiments inside the Dachau concentration camp, including Rascher’s murderous high-altitude studies in Experimental Cell Block Five. Like Benzinger, Ruff was an avowed and dedicated Nazi. He joined the party in 1938. The facility Dr. Ruff was in charge of for the Third Reich was located just ten miles across town from the institute that Dr. Strughold oversaw. As the directors of the two most important Luftwaffe medical facilities in Berlin, Ruff and Strughold collaborated closely on a number of projects during the war. Ruff and Strughold coauthored several papers together and coedited Aviation Medicine (Luftfahrtmedizin). One of the articles they cowrote so fascinated the U.S. Army Air Corps that in 1942 intelligence officers had it translated and circulated among flight surgeons at Wright Field. The two men also coauthored a book called the Compendium on Aviation Medicine, which served as a kind of handbook for Luftwaffe flight surgeons and included articles on explosive decompression and oxygen deficiency. At Heidelberg, Dr. Ruff was in charge of this work again, only now it was paid for by the U.S. Army. Working directly under Dr. Ruff at the Aero Medical Center was Dr. Konrad Schäfer, listed in declassified documents as also researching the effects of g-forces on the body. This was not Schäfer’s primary area of expertise. His wartime research work, which had been supported by both the Nazi Party’s Reich Research Council and the Luftwaffe, was the pathology of thirst. Schäfer was a tall man, slightly overweight with a receding hairline and thick-lensed glasses that made him appear slightly cross-eyed. Unlike most of his colleagues, Schäfer avoided joining the Nazi Party, which he later said cost him jobs. In 1941 he was drafted and sent to a Luftwaffe air base at Frankfurt on the Oder. When his talents as a chemist came to light—he’d worked as chief physiological chemist for the firm Schering AG—Schäfer was transferred to Berlin and given an assignment in Luftwaffe sea emergencies. “This included research on various methods to render seawater potable,” Schäfer later explained under oath.

When his talents as a chemist came to light—he’d worked as chief physiological chemist for the firm Schering AG—Schäfer was transferred to Berlin and given an assignment in Luftwaffe sea emergencies. “This included research on various methods to render seawater potable,” Schäfer later explained under oath. Sea emergencies were an area of great concern. As the man in charge of aviation medical research for the Luftwaffe, Dr. Strughold had solutions to sea emergencies high on his priority list. During the air war, every pilot knew that drinking ocean water destroyed the kidneys and brought death faster than suffering indomitable thirst. But German pilots shot down over the sea and awaiting rescue were known to break down and drink seawater anyway. The Luftwaffe announced a contest. Any doctor or chemist who could develop a method to separate the salt from seawater would be greatly rewarded. Konrad Schäfer, one of Strughold’s protégés in Berlin, aimed to solve that conundrum. Schäfer worked “in co-operation with IG Farben to create Wolfen, a mixture from barium and silver zeolith,” he later explained, which he synthesized into “a tablet named Wolfatit [which] was developed to separate the salt in a residue.” The results produced drinkable water, which was a remarkable achievement. Schäfer had succeeded where so many other doctors and chemists had failed. Dr. Oskar Schröder, head of the Luftwaffe Medical Corps, was thrilled. Konrad Schäfer had “developed a process which actually precipitated the salts from the sea water,” Schröder later testified. But another group of Luftwaffe doctors were already backing a different process, called the Berka method, which was bad news for the Schäfer process. “It was thought by the Chief of the Luftwaffe Medical Service to be too bulky and expensive,” Schröder explained. A second contest was proposed; this one to see which desalination method was superior. The effectiveness of both the Schäfer process and the Berka method would be tested on the Untermenschen at Dachau. A Luftwaffe physician named Hermann Becker-Freyseng was assigned to assist Dr. Schäfer, and to coauthor with him a paper documenting the results of the contest. The senior doctor advising Becker-Freyseng and Schäfer in their work was Dr. Siegfried Ruff. The resultant paper, called “Thirst and Thirst Quenching in Emergency Situations at Sea,” described saltwater medical experiments conducted on prisoners inside Experimental Cell Block Five. Dr. Hermann Becker-Freyseng had been a member of the Nazi Party since 1938. His specialty was oxygen poisoning in the human body. An odd-looking man, Becker-Freyseng’s unusually large ears gave the appearance of handles on either side of his head.

During the war Becker-Freyseng served as chief of the Department for Aviation Medicine and Medical Services in the Luftwaffe, another branch under an umbrella of medical facilities and laboratories overseen by Dr. Strughold. Becker-Freyseng was held in great esteem by his colleagues, many of whom, under interrogation, described him as “heroic” for the masochistic extremes he was willing to go in auto-experimentation. Becker-Freyseng conducted over one hundred experiments on himself, many of which rendered him unconscious. At least one took him to the brink of death. The story repeated most often about Becker-Freyseng was of a self-experiment he did in a chamber, also with a rabbit. Determined to learn how much oxygen would poison a man, Becker-Freyseng went into a low-pressure chamber with a rabbit with the goal of staying inside for three days. A few hours shy of his goal, Becker-Freyseng began to show symptoms of paralysis. “The rabbit died, Becker-Freyseng recuperated,” Strughold later explained under oath. That was all during the war. Now Ruff, Benzinger, Schäfer, Schröder, and Becker-Freyseng, with the approval of Strughold and Armstrong, continued their work on secret aviation medical projects initially conceived for Hitler’s war machine. The Army Air Forces Aero Medical Center in Heidelberg was a squat, brick, two-story facility facing the Neckar River. Only a few months prior it had been the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Medical Research, a bastion of Nazi science where chemists and physicists worked on projects for the Reich’s war machine. At its front entrance, the Reich’s flag came down and the U.S. flag went up. Photographs of Hitler were pulled from the walls and replaced by framed photographs of Army Air Forces generals in military pose. Most of the furniture stayed the same. In the dining room German waiters in white servers’ coats provided table service at mealtimes. A single 5^(′′) x 8^(′′) requisition receipt, dated September 14, 1945, made the transition official: “This property is needed by U.S. Forces, and the requisition is in proportion to the resources of the country.” The mission statement of the project, classified Top Secret, was succinct: “the exploitation of certain uncompleted German aviation medical research projects.” Dr. Strughold was put in charge of hiring doctors, “all of whom are considered authorities in a particular field of medicine.” Across the American zone of Germany, entire laboratories were dismantled and reassembled here at the secret facility in Heidelberg. More than twenty tons of medical research equipment was salvaged from the Tempelhof Airport, in Berlin, including a “huge human centrifuge… and a low pressure chamber the", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:Operation Paperclip_cleaned.txt:154:b7d56db05f8d", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 6067, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "Operation Paperclip_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/031622104X", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "Operation Paperclip_cleaned", "chunk_index": 155, "text": "Secret, was succinct: “the exploitation of certain uncompleted German aviation medical research projects.” Dr. Strughold was put in charge of hiring doctors, “all of whom are considered authorities in a particular field of medicine.” Across the American zone of Germany, entire laboratories were dismantled and reassembled here at the secret facility in Heidelberg. More than twenty tons of medical research equipment was salvaged from the Tempelhof Airport, in Berlin, including a “huge human centrifuge… and a low pressure chamber the length of two, ordinary Pullman cars.” There was equipment here that American physicians had never seen before: esoteric items including a Nagel Anomaloscope, a Zeiss-made interferometer, an Engelking-Hartung adaptometer, a Schmidt-Haensch photometer, and a precisionbuilt Siemens electron microscope—with which to study night vision, blood circulation, g-forces, and the bends. Even the low-pressure chamber from Georg Weltz’s research facility at Freising, near the Munich dairy farm, was brought to Heidelberg. This was the laboratory where Dr. Leo Alexander had experienced his revelation that Nazi doctors had been freezing people to death. It was a precarious time for doctors who had previously worked for the Reich. With the Nuremberg trial under way, the international press had its attention focused on war crimes. German doctors were looked at with suspicion. Articles about Nazi doctors, including the November 1945 piece in the Washington Post about the “science” of freezing humans, put a spotlight on German medicine. Many doctors fled the country to South America through escape routes called ratlines. Others tried to blend in by offering their services in displaced-persons camps. Some killed themselves. Maximilian de Crinis, chief of the psychiatric department at the University Charité in Berlin, swallowed a cyanide capsule in the last days of the war. Ernst-Robert Grawitz, physician for the SS and president of the German Red Cross, killed himself and his family, including his young children, by detonating a small bomb inside his house outside Berlin. The Reich Health Leader, Leonardo Conti, hanged himself in his cell at Nuremberg. Ernst Holzlöhner, the senior doctor at the University of Berlin who conducted the freezing experiments at Dachau with Sigmund Rascher, committed suicide in June 1945 after being interrogated by British investigators. The list of suicides was long, but the number of German doctors believed to have been involved in war crimes was even longer. The U.S. war crimes office for the chief counsel wrote up a list of doctors involved in medical research that resulted in “mercy killings,” a euphemism used by the Reich for its medical murder programs. The list was classified with a strict caveat that access to it remain “restricted for 80 years from the date of creation.” This meant that, by the time the world would know who was on this list, it would be the year 2025, and everyone named would be dead.

A copy of the list was given to the commander of the Army Air Forces Aero Medical Center, Robert J. Benford. Five doctors working at the center starting in the fall of 1945 were on the list: Theodor Benzinger, Siegfried Ruff, Konrad Schäfer, Hermann Becker-Freyseng, and Oskar Schröder. Instead of firing these physicians suspected of heinous war crimes, the center kept the doctors in its employ and the list was classified. The list remained secret from the public until 2012, when the Department of Defense (DoD) agreed to declassify it for this book. By the end of January 1946, 160 Nazi scientists had been secreted into America. The single largest group was comprised of the 115 rocket specialists at Fort Bliss, Texas, led by Wernher von Braun. The men resided in a two-story barracks on the Fort Bliss reservation and worked in a laboratory that was formerly the William Beaumont General Hospital. They ate in a mess hall shared with Native American Indians, which only enhanced von Braun’s perception that he was living life inside an adventure novel. “It is such a romantic Karl May affair,” von Braun wrote in a letter to his parents in Germany. Karl May was a German novelist famous for his cowboy and Indian westerns. Soon, von Braun would begin writing a novel of his own, in the science fiction genre, about space travel to Mars. Von Braun loved the desert landscape, the cactus, the vast gypsum dune fields, and the long drives in open army jeeps. Rocket work was not perfect, but it progressed. “Frankly we were disappointed with what we found in this country during our first year or so,” von Braun later recalled. “At Peenemünde, we’d been coddled. Here they were counting pennies,” he said of the U.S. Army. V-2 launchings would take place about eighty miles away, on the White Sands Proving Ground, and getting there meant a long and beautiful ride. An army bus took scientists around the Franklin Mountains, through El Paso, and along the Rio Grande to Las Cruces. Next came the rugged journey over the San Andreas pass and into the Tularosa Basin, where the army’s proving grounds began. Twelve to fifteen Germans were sent at a time to White Sands, where they lived in barracks alongside men from the General Electric Company and a technical army unit. The actual rocket firings took place inside a single forty-foot-deep pit, with the Germans watching the launches from a massive but", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:Operation Paperclip_cleaned.txt:156:68141b97bc40", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 6069, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "Operation Paperclip_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/031622104X", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "Operation Paperclip_cleaned", "chunk_index": 157, "text": "Paso, and along the Rio Grande to Las Cruces.

The actual rocket firings took place inside a single forty-foot-deep pit, with the Germans watching the launches from a massive but rudimentary concrete blockhouse nearby. When the first V-2 was launched, in April 1946, it climbed to three miles. Although one of the fins fell off, von Braun felt inspired to draft a memo to Robert Oppenheimer, director of Los Alamos, proposing the idea of merging his missile with the atomic bomb. The memo turned into a proposal, “Use of Atomic Warheads in Projected Missiles,” submitted to the army. In it, von Braun discussed building a rocket that could carry a two-thousandplus-pound nuclear payload a distance of one thousand miles. Two personal changes in von Braun were afoot. The first was that he joined an Evangelical Christian church and became “born again,” something he rarely discussed in public. The second was that he decided to marry his first cousin, Maria von Quistorp, the daughter of his mother’s brother, Alexander von Quistorp. Von Braun was nearly twice her age—she had just turned eighteen in the summer of 1946—and she lived in Germany. From Texas, von Braun began making plans to bring his future bride to the United States. Descriptions of life out west in America varied from scientist to scientist. “The conditions of employment were considered to be fair and generous by all,” said Dieter Huzel, the engineer who’d stashed the V-2 documents in the Dörnten Mine. Arthur Rudolph liked the fact that the swimming pool and the bowling alley were made available to the Germans exclusively one afternoon a week. He told his biographer, who did not want to be publicly identified and wrote using the pseudonym Thomas Franklin, that he missed his family and his Bible. Von Braun’s brother, Magnus, was being investigated by the FBI for selling a platinum bar he had illegally smuggled into the United States. Interrogators with the Department of Justice found Magnus von Braun to be “snobby” and “conceited” and said that he seemed to pose “a worse threat to security than a half a dozen discredited SS Generals.” For Army Ordnance there were many problems to overcome.

Funding was scarce. Shrinking military budgets offered very little room for missile development immediately after the end of a world war. Also at Fort Bliss the army discovered that not all the so-called rocket scientists had the talents they allegedly possessed. Karl Otto Fleischer, Major Staver’s original lead for the Dörnten mine and the man who led him on the wild goose chase around the Harz and to the Inn of the Three Lime Trees, claimed to have been the Wehrmacht’s business manager, when in reality he had been in charge of food services. In Texas, Fleischer was assigned the job of club manager until he was finally “repatriated” to Germany. Von Braun had also sold the army on hiring Walter Weisemann, a Nazi public relations officer who had done some work in the Peenemünde valve shop. Von Braun called him an “eminent scientist.” In reality, Weisemann learned engineering in America working for the army. Fifteen hundred miles across the country, in the winter of 1946, there were now thirty German scientists at Wright Field. Colonel Putt considered this sum to be offensively low. At least once a month, he wrote to Army Air Forces headquarters in Washington requesting more German scientists and inquiring why the importation of these “rare minds” was happening at a snail’s pace. In fact, there was very little for the Germans to do at Wright Field, and many of them were restless. The Air Documents Research Center, formerly in London, had also moved to the Air Material Command headquarters, at Wright Field. There, five hundred employees sorted, catalogued, indexed, and put on microfiche some 1,500 tons of German documents captured by Alsos, CIOS, and T-Forces after the war. So abundant was the material that more than one hundred thousand technical words had been added to the Air Material Command’s English-language dictionary. The plethora of information provided some work opportunities for a predominantly idle group of German specialists who in turn resented this kind of work. The Germans perceived themselves as inventors and visionaries, not librarians or bureaucrats. One of the Germans, a Nazi businessman named Albert Patin, had been keeping track of the groups’ complaints, which now made their way to Colonel Putt’s desk. It was not just the lack of challenging work, said the Germans; it was the whole package deal. The Hilltop was a dump. Payments were slow. The mail to Germany was even slower. Dayton had no civilized culture. The laboratory facilities at Wright Field were nothing compared to the grand laboratories of the Third Reich. In general, the Germans told Putt, they were beginning to “distrust” their American hosts “based on promises broken by USA officers.” When Patin’s facilities were first captured by the U.S. Army, one of the American technical investigators, Captain H. Freiberger, was so amazed", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:Operation Paperclip_cleaned.txt:158:9627b4bc57e7", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 6071, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "Operation Paperclip_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/031622104X", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "Operation Paperclip_cleaned", "chunk_index": 159, "text": "The Hilltop was a dump.

Freiberger, was so amazed by Patin’s industrial vision that he called “the soundness of his principles a revelation.” For Colonel Putt, Albert Patin’s wartime innovations represented the best and the brightest of Reich science. Putt coveted the scientific inventions that Patin’s factories mass-produced, which included navigation aids, in-flight steering mechanisms, and automatic control devices. This kind of technology would give the Army Air Forces a ten-year jump on anything the Russians had, Putt believed. Hiring Patin for a U.S. Army Air Forces contract meant ignoring his past. His armaments factories used slave labor, which was a war crime. In an autobiographical report for Putt, Albert Patin admitted that many of the people in his six-thousand-person workforce were slave laborers supplied by Heinrich Himmler’s SS. Patin stated that he was not ashamed of this; he explained to Colonel Putt that he had been one of the better bosses in the Third Reich. He didn’t encircle his factories in electric fencing like other industrialists did. Patin acknowledged that his wartime access to Hitler’s inner circle benefited his businesses, but he did not see how this made him a war profiteer. He was just following orders. Patin took summer holidays with the Göring family and winter trips with Albert Speer’s munitions procurement chief, Dieter Stahl, but so did a lot of people. He was no better and no worse. During this slow period at Wright Field, Colonel Putt had Albert Patin survey the other Germans. He told Patin to be alert to grudges so that Patin could formalize his list of complaints. Putt would in turn forward this summary to his superiors at Air Materiel Command. Patin’s job, Putt counseled, was to emphasize how the Germans had become depressed, even suicidal, without their families and without the promise of long-term work. Colonel Putt sent Patin’s summary of complaints to Air Force Headquarters in Washington, to the attention of Brigadier General John A. Samford. In his own cover letter, Putt requested that immediate action be taken to “improve the morale [of the Germans] and save the existing situation.” The name Albert Patin had already caught General Samford’s eye.

A letter had recently been sent to Patin in which lucrative offers from French and Russian intelligence agents were discussed. Brigadier General Samford’s office was made aware of this unwelcome development. Coupled with the summary of German scientists’ dissatisfaction, General Samford took action. He sent the complaint list as well as Patin’s intercepted mail to the War Department. “Immediate action in this situation is imperative if we are to divert the services of valuable scientists from France and Russia to the United States,” General Samford warned his colleagues. The timing created a perfect storm. The Joint Intelligence Committee was in the process of implementing a major policy change. It had just warned the Joint Chiefs that the existing idea of using restraint when dealing with the Soviets needed to be reconsidered. “Unless the migration of important German scientists and technicians into the Soviet zone is stopped,” read a JIC memo to the Joint Chiefs, “we believe that the Soviet Union within a relatively short time may equal United States developments in the fields of atomic research and guided missiles and may be ahead of U.S. developments in other fields of great military importance, including infra-red, television and jet propulsion.” The JIC also stated, incorrectly, that German nuclear physicists were helping the Russians develop a nuclear bomb and that “their assistance had already cut substantially, probably by several years, the time needed for the USSR to achieve practical results.” In reality the Soviets had gotten to where they were in atomic bomb development not because of any German rare minds but by stealing information from American scientists at Los Alamos. Not until 1949 would the CIA learn that the Russian mole was a British scientist named Karl Fuchs, who worked on the Manhattan Project. In response to the perception that the Soviets were getting all the “important German scientists,” the Joint Intelligence Committee proposed to the JIOA that three changes be implemented in the Nazi scientist program, effective immediately. The first was to do everything possible in Germany to prevent more scientists from working for the Russians. The second was that the U.S. Army was to make sure that German scientists and their families were given whatever it was they were asking for, including American visas. Third, a list was drawn up proposing that as many as one thousand additional Germans be brought to America for weapons-related research.

Third, a list was drawn up proposing that as many as one thousand additional Germans be brought to America for weapons-related research. For Samuel Klaus, the second proposed policy change was untenable. The Nazi scientist program was originally defined as “temporary,” with scientists working under military custody. That was how the War Department was able to circumvent immigration law for all the scientists already here. Now the JIOA was demanding that immigration visas be issued to scientists and their families. Even if the policy change were approved, Klaus argued, the visa process was a slow-going one. The State Department was legally required to approve each scientist’s visa application individually. This was not an overnight task but a lengthy investigative process. The person requesting a visa was required to list on his or her application contacts who would in turn be interviewed by a representative from State. The Office of the Military Government in Germany needed to compile a security report on each individual scientist. Nazi Party records would have to be pulled from the Berlin Document Center. If the scientist had won an honorary award from the National Socialist German Workers Party (NSDAP)—the Nazi Party—or was a member of the SS or the SA, that needed to be explained. This was the law, Klaus said. With the new information about the Soviets, Robert Patterson, now secretary of war, shifted from being weary of the Nazi scientist program to becoming its champion. Only a year earlier, Patterson had called the German scientists “enemies… capable of sabotaging our war effort,” and had warned the Joint Chiefs of Staff that “[b]ringing them to this country raises delicate questions.” Now he stated in a memorandum that “the War Department should do everything possible to clear away obstacles that may be raised in the State Department.” This in turn caused Secretary of State James F. Byrnes, Samuel Klaus’s boss, to soften his opposition to Operation Overcast. Due to the emerging Soviet threat, Secretary of State Byrnes and Secretary of War Patterson agreed informally that leaving German scientists unsupervised inside Germany, where they could be bought by the Russians, was too dangerous. If the State Department required individual investigations, so be it, Byrnes said. German scientists and their families should be allowed to enter the country under temporary military custody with an interim State Department blessing, Patterson wrote. The logic was simple. If we don’t get them, the Russians will. The State-War-Navy Coordinating Committee, now acting as an advisory body to JIOA, confirmed agreement with the positions of the Secretaries of War and State but added another consideration to the argument.

The State-War-Navy Coordinating Committee, now acting as an advisory body to JIOA, confirmed agreement with the positions of the Secretaries of War and State but added another consideration to the argument. German scientists left to their own devices presented “serious military implications to the future of United States Security,” according to SWNCC. In other words, Samuel Klaus’s argument could now be used against him in the military’s attempt to speed up the visa application process. Yes, the German scientists were inherently untrustworthy—so much so that they could not be trusted if they were left unsupervised, let alone left available to competing powers. On March 4, 1946, SWNCC Paper No. 275/5 went into effect. German scientists could now be admitted to the United States in a classified program that was in the “national interest.” This shifted the focus from whether or not someone was a Nazi to whether they were someone the Russians would be interested in. The commander in chief of U.S. Forces of Occupation in Germany and commander of U.S. Forces, European Theater (USFET), General Joseph T. McNarney, was told to draft a list of one thousand top scientists in Germany who were to be brought to the United States at once so the Russians couldn’t get them. A military intelligence officer named Colonel R. D. Wentworth was assigned to provide General McNarney with material support on behalf of Army Intelligence, G-2. The scientists’ families were to be given food and clothing and were to be housed in a secret military facility northeast of Munich called Landshut until their visa applications were approved. It was a radical revision of the initial terms of the German scientist program, and it was exactly what the JIOA had envisioned all along. The following month, the members of JIOA were called together to spend an entire day hammering out new program protocols. Expert consultants like Alsos scientific director Samuel Goudsmit were invited to attend. Expedite the German scientist program, said the Joint Chiefs of Staff. There were now 175 German scientists in America under military custody, none of whom had visas. The consensus, save Klaus, was that the application process needed to be sped up. The thorniest issue had to do with getting the State Department to approve certain individuals who had clearly been Nazi ideologues, including members of the SS and SA. Also at issue were those men who received high awards for their important contributions to the Nazi Party. These were people that by regulation were entirely ineligible for citizenship.

Also at issue were those men who received high awards for their important contributions to the Nazi Party. These were people that by regulation were entirely ineligible for citizenship. The meeting resulted in a clever workaround. Army Intelligence officers reviewing the OMGUS security reports of certain scientists could discreetly attach a paperclip to the files of the more troublesome cases. Those files would not be presented to the State Department right away. Instead, those men would remain under military custody in America, most likely for a longer period of time than some of their fellows. As a result, the Nazi scientist program got a new code name. Operation Overcast had apparently been compromised after the families of the German scientists starting calling their U.S. military housing Camp Overcast. So from now on, the Nazi scientist program would be called Operation Paperclip. Not everyone understood the discreet paperclip-attached-to-the-file protocol. The first major setback came just a few months later, on July 17, 1946. General Joseph McNarney wrote to JIOA stating that he had worked with Colonel Wentworth to identify 869 German scientists who were ready to sign Paperclip contracts. But there was an obstacle. “There is a large number of former Nazis and mandatory unemployables among those shown on the list,” General McNarney wrote. “These [men] cannot now or later be employed in the United States zone of Germany except in the labor category.” McNarney was following USFET rules that said all members of the SS and the SA had to go through mandatory denazification trials. Citing America’s “national interest,” the JIOA would now change the language of the core principle guiding Paperclip’s original charter. “No known or alleged war criminals” and “no active Nazis” would become no persons who might try and “plan for the resurgence of German military potential.” Assistant Secretary of War Howard Petersen felt this new language would allow the JIOA to “bypass the visa people,” as stated in a memo dated July 24, 1946. But this was meant to be temporary. Eventually, State Department officials like Samuel Klaus would take umbrage at this language. What JIOA really needed was an endorsement from President Truman. By the summer of 1946 the relationship between the United States and the Soviet Union was shattering. The legendary Long Telegram, written by George F. Keenan, America’s diplomat in Moscow, had been received at the State Department, reviewed by the president and his advisers, and sent to every U.S. embassy around the world. After analyzing the Soviet’s “neurotic view of world affairs,” Keenan warned his bosses at the State Department that “in the long run there can be no permanent peaceful coexistence” with the Soviet Union.

After analyzing the Soviet’s “neurotic view of world affairs,” Keenan warned his bosses at the State Department that “in the long run there can be no permanent peaceful coexistence” with the Soviet Union. The two nations were destined to become steadfast enemies, Keenan said. Influenced by Keenan’s insights, President Truman asked White House counsel Clark Clifford to prepare a study of the current state of affairs and the future prospects regarding Soviet-American relations from a military standpoint. To do so Clifford culled reports and briefings from the Secretaries of War, State, and Navy as well as the attorney general, the Joint Chiefs of Staff, various directors of military and civilian intelligence, and George Keenan. The result was an alarming Top Secret analysis. The report’s conclusion was made clear in the introduction: “Soviet leaders believe that a conflict is inevitable between the U.S.S.R. and the capitalist states, and their duty is to prepare the Soviet Union for this conflict.” Clifford warned that Soviet leaders were on a path “designed to lead to eventual world domination.” The Russians were developing atomic weapons, guided missiles, a strategic air force, and biological and chemical weapons programs. The idea of “peaceful coexistence of communist and capitalist nations is impossible,” Clifford wrote. The only way to counter this threat was to use the “language of military power.” Not military force, but military threat. On August 30, 1946, the undersecretary of the State Department, Dean Acheson, asked President Truman to make a decision on Paperclip. If the president did not act quickly, Acheson wrote, many of the German scientists “may be lost to us.” After four days of deliberation Truman gave his official approval of the program and agreed that Operation Paperclip should be expanded to include one thousand German scientists and technicians and allow for their eventual immigration to the United States. With presidential approval official, the attorney general was able to expedite the proposed changes to the program. A new JIOA contract was drawn up, allowing scientists who had been in the United States for six months to sign on for another year, and with the government maintaining the right to renew the contract for another five years. Operation Paperclip was transitioning from a temporary program to a long-term one. Former enemies of the state would now be eligible for coveted U.S. citizenship. In response to the Clifford Report, the Joint Intelligence Committee conducted its own classified assessment of the Soviet threat, JCS 1696. The Soviet Union, wrote the JIC, sought world domination and would begin by bringing other nations into Soviet control to isolate the capitalist world.

The Soviet Union, wrote the JIC, sought world domination and would begin by bringing other nations into Soviet control to isolate the capitalist world. JIC saw a future war with the Soviet Union as being of apocalyptic proportion. In a war “with the Soviet Union we must envisage complete and total hostilities unrestricted in any way on the Soviet part by adherence to any international convention or humanitarian principals,” noted JCS 1696. “Preparations envisaged on our part and our plans must be on this basis.” In other words, for the United States to prepare for “total war” with the Soviets, America had to maintain military supremacy in all areas of war fighting, including chemical warfare, biological warfare, atomic warfare, and any other kind of warfare the other side dreamed up. One of the scientists on the JIOA list of one thousand was Dr. Kurt Blome. The Allies were unsure what to do with Hitler’s biological weapons maker. Clearly, no discreet paperclip attached to Blome’s file would be able to whitewash the reality of his inner-circle role as deputy surgeon general of the Third Reich. But if the United States were to go to war with the Soviet Union it would mean “total war” and, according to JCS 1696, would likely include biological warfare. America needed to “envisage” such a scenario and to plan for it, with both sword and shield. Dr. Blome had spent months at the Dustbin interrogation facility, Castle Kransberg, but had recently been transferred to the U.S. Army Military Intelligence Service Center at Darmstadt, located eighteen miles south of Frankfurt. In the summer of 1946, Dr. Blome was employed there by the U.S. Army “in the capacity of a doctor.” Dr. Kurt Blome’s expertise was in great demand, but his future was as yet undecided. In his Posen laboratory, Blome had made considerable progress with live plague pathogens, including bubonic and pneumonic plague. How far that research progressed remained vague, likely because it would put an unwanted spotlight on human experiments many believed had taken place there. Blome repeatedly told investigators that he had intended to conduct human trials but never actually did. Blome’s American counterpart in wartime plague-weapon research was a left-leaning bacteriologist named Dr. Theodor Rosebury. During the war, the biological weapons work Rosebury conducted was so highly classified that it was considered as secret as atomic research. He had worked at a research facility outside Washington, D.C., called Camp Detrick. It was like Posen, only bigger. Detrick had 2,273 personnel working on Top Secret biological warfare programs.

Like Blome, Rosebury worked on bubonic plague. Rosebury’s colleagues worked on 199 other germ bomb projects, including anthrax spore production, plant and animal diseases, and insect research, in an effort to determine which bugs were the most effective carriers of certain diseases. Almost no one in America had any idea that the U.S. Army had been developing biological weapons until January 3, 1946, when the War Department released a slim, sanitized government monograph called the Merck Report. That is when the American public learned for the first time that the government’s Top Secret program had been “cloaked in the deepest wartime secrecy, matched only by the Manhattan Project for developing the Atomic Bomb.” The rationale behind developing these kinds of weapons, the public was told, was the same as it had been with America’s wartime chemical weapons program. If the Nazis had used biological agents to kill Allied soldiers, the U.S. military would have been prepared to retaliate in kind. Yes, the war was over, Americans were now told, but unfortunately there was a new and emerging threat out there, the Merck Report warned, an invisible and insidious evil capable of killing millions on a vast, unknowable scale. America’s bioweapons program needed to continue, the Merck Report made clear. America may have won the war with the mighty atomic bomb, but biological weapons were the poor man’s nuclear weapon. Biological weapons could be made by just about any country “without vast expenditures of money or the construction of huge production facilities.” A bioweapon could be hidden “under the guise of legitimate medical or bacteriological research,” the report said. The Merck Report was written by George W. Merck, a forty-eight-year-old chemist and the owner of Merck & Co., a pharmaceutical manufacturer in New Jersey. Merck had served Presidents Roosevelt and Truman as civilian head of the U.S. biological warfare effort during the war. Merck & Co. made and sold vaccines, notably the first commercial U.S. smallpox vaccine, in 1898, and, in 1942, it manufactured penicillin G, among the first general antibiotics. During World War II, U.S. soldiers received smallpox vaccines. The man diagnosing the bioweapons threat, George Merck, was also the man whose company might sell the government the solution to combat the threat. In 1946 this was not looked upon with the same kind of scrutiny as it might have been decades later, because America’s military-industrial complex had yet to be broadly", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:Operation Paperclip_cleaned.txt:166:3df7bdd7622f", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 6079, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "Operation Paperclip_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/031622104X", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "Operation Paperclip_cleaned", "chunk_index": 167, "text": "commercial U.S. smallpox vaccine, in 1898, and, in 1942, it manufactured penicillin G, among the first general antibiotics.

In 1946 this was not looked upon with the same kind of scrutiny as it might have been decades later, because America’s military-industrial complex had yet to be broadly revealed. The Merck Report did not specify what kind of germ warfare had been researched and developed by the United States, only that it took place at a Top Secret facility “in Maryland.” Camp Detrick was a 154-acre land parcel surrounded by cow fields about an hour’s drive north of Washington, and under the jurisdiction of the former Chemical Warfare Service, then the Chemical Corps. After the release of the Merck Report, and coupled with the ominous “total war” prospects as outlined in the Clifford Report and the JCS 1696, Congress would grant vast sums of money to the Chemical Corps for biological weapons research and Detrick would expand exponentially. Dr. Kurt Blome had information that was coveted by the bacteriologists at Camp Detrick, and plans were being drawn up to interview him. And then, in the summer of 1946, a totally unexpected event occurred inside the Palace of Justice in Nuremberg that would render hiring Dr. Kurt Blome for Operation Paperclip an impossibility, at least for now. In the tenth month of the trial, the Soviets presented a surprise witness, putting an unforeseen and unwelcomed focus on Dr. Kurt Blome. The witness was Major General Dr. Walter Schreiber—the shield to Blome’s sword. Schreiber was brought forth as a witness to show that, after the Nazis’ crushing defeat at Stalingrad, the Third Reich was planning to retaliate by conducting a major biological warfare offensive against Soviet troops. This was the first time information about biological warfare was being presented at the trial. The Allies were not informed that Schreiber was going to be a witness. U.S. prosecutors asked to interview him in advance of his testimony, but the Soviets denied the request. The medical war crimes investigator, Dr. Leopold Alexander, appealed to speak with Schreiber himself, to no avail. During the war, Schreiber held the position of wartime chief of medical services, Supreme Command, Wehrmacht.

According to Schreiber, he had opened a large military hospital in a subway tunnel around the corner from the Führerbunker and had been tending to “several hundred wounded” soldiers when the Soviets captured him. After being taken by train to the Soviet Union, he was moved around various interrogation facilities, he said, until he ended up in Lubyanka Prison, the notorious penitentiary located inside KGB headquarters in Moscow. Nuremberg was Schreiber’s first public appearance since war’s end. No one, including his family members, had any idea where he had been. That the former surgeon general for the Third Reich was now going to help Russian prosecutors send his former Nazi colleagues to the gallows for their crimes was as ironic as it was outrageous. Dr. Schreiber was on the U.S. Army’s Central Registry of War Criminals and Security Suspects list. Along with many of those colleagues, and since war’s end, Major General Walter Schreiber had been sought by the Allied forces for possible war crimes. If the Americans had located him and had a chance to interrogate him, he might well have been in the dock at Nuremberg facing the hangman’s noose alongside his colleagues. Instead, here he was, testifying against them. It was Monday morning, August 26, 1946, when Dr. Schreiber took the stand: Day 211 of the trial. Colonel Y. V. Pokrovsky, deputy chief prosecutor of the Soviet Union, presented Schreiber to the court as a witness. German defense lawyer Dr. Hans Laternser, counsel for the General Staff and Army High Command (Oberkommando des Heeres, or OKH), objected, on the grounds that the evidence was submitted too late. “The Tribunal is not inclined to admit any evidence so late as this, or to reopen questions which have been gone into fully before the Tribunal,” said the tribunal’s president, Lord Justice Sir Geoffrey Lawrence, “but, on the other hand, in view of the importance of the statement of Major General Schreiber and its particular relevance, not only to the case of certain of the individual defendants but also, to the case of the High Command, the Tribunal will allow Major General Schreiber to be heard as a witness.” In other words, Schreiber was a high-ranking Nazi general and the judges wanted to hear what he had to say. With that, Schreiber was brought to the witness stand. He stood five foot six and weighed 156 pounds. A long-sleeve shirt covered the saber scars on his right forearm.

With that, Schreiber was brought to the witness stand. He stood five foot six and weighed 156 pounds. A long-sleeve shirt covered the saber scars on his right forearm. At fifty-three years old, Schreiber had been an active military doctor since 1921. He was an expert in bacteriology and epidemiology and had traveled the globe studying infectious diseases, from a plague outbreak in West Africa to a malaria epidemic in Tunisia. He claimed to understand medical aspects of desert warfare and winter warfare better than anyone else in the Third Reich. He was also an expert in biological and chemical weapons, in typhus and malaria epidemics, and in the causes and conditions of jaundice and gangrene. When war came Schreiber, an affable and ambitious son of a postal worker, was catapulted to the top of the Wehrmacht’s medical chain of command. This was in part due to the Reich’s zealously germ-phobic core. Schreiber’s vast knowledge of and experience with hygiene-related epidemics made his expertise highly valuable to the Nazi Party. He was put in charge of the research to fight infectious disease, and also in remedial means to defend against outbreaks. In this way, he became privy to Reich medical policy from the top down. In 1942, Hermann Göring also put General Schreiber in charge of protection against gas and bacteriological warfare, which is how he came to be in charge of the Reich’s program to produce vaccines. “In the second World War things occurred on the German side which were against the unchangeable laws of medical ethics,” Schreiber said from the stand. “In the interests of the German people, of medical science in Germany, and the training of the younger generation of physicians in the future, I consider it necessary that these things should be thoroughly cleared up. The matters in question are the preparations for bacteriological warfare, and they give rise to epidemics and experiments on human beings.” Schreiber was saying that the Reich had been preparing for offensive biological warfare and had used the Untermenschen—the subhumans—as guinea pigs. “I myself took the initiative,” Schreiber declared. “When I heard the report of Dr. Kramer and Professor Holzlehner [Holzlöhner] here in Nuremberg I was deeply shocked at the obviously perverted conceptions of some of the German doctors,” he said. Holzlöhner and Schreiber had been close friends and colleagues. After Schreiber learned about Holzlöhner’s murderous freezing experiments—at the Nuremberg conference of 1942, “Medical Problems of Sea Distress and Winter Distress”—he invited Holzlöhner to come give the same lecture at the Military Medical Academy in Berlin. “In the prison camp German newspapers were available in the club room,” Schreiber claimed, making the notorious", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:Operation Paperclip_cleaned.txt:169:2b3a8f468f01", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 6082, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "Operation Paperclip_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/031622104X", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "Operation Paperclip_cleaned", "chunk_index": 170, "text": "Nuremberg I was deeply shocked at the obviously perverted conceptions of some of the German doctors,” he said.

As a result of the war situation the High Command authorities now had to take a different view of the question of the use of bacteria as a weapon in warfare from the one held up till now by the Army Medical Inspectorate,” Schreiber testified. “Consequently, the Führer, Adolf Hitler, had charged Reich Marshal Hermann Goering to direct the carrying out of all preparations for bacteriological warfare, and had given him the necessary powers,” Schreiber said. In this statement, Schreiber was contradicting the generally accepted notion that Hitler had never authorized his generals to use chemical or biological weapons against Allied troops. In fact, no chemical or biological weapons were ever used in World War II, which made it strange that Schreiber had been brought all the way to Nuremberg to testify to something that was ultimately irrelevant to the war crimes trial. Why, then, was Schreiber really there? “At [this] secret conference it was decided that an institute should be created for the production of bacterial cultures on a large scale,” Schreiber said, “and the carrying out of scientific experiments to examine the possibilities of using bacteria [in warfare]. The institute was also to be used for experimenting with pests which could be used against domestic animals and crops, and which were to be made available if they were found practicable.” Blome’s institute for plague research. “I do not know any details about them. I only know that aircraft were used for spraying tests with bacteria emulsion, and that insects harmful to plants, such as beetles, were experimented with, but I cannot give any details. I did not make experiments myself.” Instead of answering the question, General Schreiber went into minute detail regarding a meeting in March 1945 with Dr. Blome. “In March 1945, Professor Blome visited me at my office at the Military Medical Academy,” Schreiber", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:Operation Paperclip_cleaned.txt:170:0811a7fa03d2", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 6083, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "Operation Paperclip_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/031622104X", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "Operation Paperclip_cleaned", "chunk_index": 171, "text": "do not know any details about them.

He asked me whether I could accommodate him and his men in the laboratories at Sachsenburg so that they could continue their work there; he had been forced out of his institute at Posen by the advance of the Red Army. He had had to flee from the institute and he had not even been able to blow it up. He was very worried at the fact that the installations for experiments on human beings at this institute, the purpose of which was obvious, might be easily recognized by the Russians for what they were. He had tried to have the institute destroyed by a Stuka bomb but that, too, was not possible. Therefore, he asked me to see to it that he be permitted to continue work at Sachsenburg on his plague cultures, which he had saved,” Schreiber said. Dr. Blome wasn’t on trial. Why was Schreiber spending so much of his testimony talking about Dr. Blome? “During his visit Blome told me that he could continue his work at an alternative laboratory in [Geraberg,] Thuringia,” Schreiber said, “but that this was not yet completed. It would take a few days or even a few weeks to complete it, and that he had to have accommodation until then. He added that if the plague bacteria were to be used when the military operations were so near to the borders of Germany, when units of the Red Army were already on German soil, it would, of course, be necessary to provide special protection for the troops and the civilian population. A serum had to be produced. Here again time had been lost, and as a result of all these delays it had never been possible to put the idea into effect.” Was Schreiber’s testimony focused against Dr. Kurt Blome out of some kind of personal rivalry or vendetta? On the witness stand, Schreiber also fingered a number of other Reich medical doctors, none of whom was on trial. In addition to naming Kramer and Holzlöhner as organizers of the freezing experiments, Schreiber said that a man called Dr. Ding “had artificially infected [KZ prisoners] with typhus using typhus-infected lice” and that the “talented surgeon” Dr. Karl Gebhardt had “carried out cranium operations on Russian prisoners of war and had killed the prisoners at certain intervals in order to observe the", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:Operation Paperclip_cleaned.txt:171:349b50a28f76", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 6084, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "Operation Paperclip_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/031622104X", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "Operation Paperclip_cleaned", "chunk_index": 172, "text": "witness stand, Schreiber also fingered a number of other Reich medical doctors, none of whom was on trial.

Laternser had no further questions. The tribunal adjourned. Perhaps embarrassed by the fact that their star witness had been caught in a lie, the Russians did not call Schreiber back to the stand. Dr. Alexander made yet another attempt to interview him, again without success. The Russians said they were sorry, but Dr. Schreiber had already been transported back to Moscow. It was a curious event, but something did result from Schreiber’s bizarre testimony. Two days later, a military vehicle pulled into the U.S. Army Military Intelligence Service Center at Darmstadt, where Blome had been employed by the army as a post doctor. Dr. Blome was arrested and taken to the prison complex at the Nuremberg Palace of Justice. A “confidential change of status report” now listed him as a prisoner in the custody of the 6850 Internal Security Detachment, Nuremberg, where Colonel Burton Andrus served as prison commandant. One hundred and fifty miles from Nuremberg, at the Army Air Forces classified research facility in Heidelberg, the massive undertaking forged ahead. For an entire year now, day in and day out, fiftyeight German physicians in white lab coats had been working on an array of research projects in state-of-the-art laboratories studying human endurance, night vision, blood dynamics, exposure to bomb blast, acoustic physiology, and more. They all reported to Dr. Strughold, who reported to the facility’s commanding officer, Colonel Robert J. Benford. High-ranking military officers regularly visited the facility, including its two founders, General Malcolm Grow and Colonel Harry Armstrong. Grow was working in Washington, D.C., as the air surgeon (soon to be the first surgeon general of the U.S. Air Force). Harry Armstrong had returned to Texas where he was now commandant at the School of Aviation Medicine (SAM) at Randolph Field. Working alongside the Nazi doctors in Heidelberg were dozens of army translators preparing English-language versions of the physicians’ reports. By September 1946 there were over a thousand pages of documents completed. Soon everything would be compiled into a two-volume monograph for the Army Air Forces entitled German Aviation Medicine, World War II.

Soon everything would be compiled into a two-volume monograph for the Army Air Forces entitled German Aviation Medicine, World War II. Intelligence Corps, 303 Detachment, arrived at the center with five arrest warrants in hand. Doctors Theodor Benzinger, Siegfried Ruff, Konrad Schäfer, Hermann Becker-Freyseng, and Oskar Schröder were wanted by the International Military Tribunal, Nuremberg, for “War Crimes as suspect.” The men were arrested and taken to the prison complex at the Nuremberg Palace of Justice, to the same wing where Dr. Blome was already incarcerated. If any of this were to come to light—that the U.S. Army Air Forces had been employing war crimes suspects and had them conducting military research at a facility inside Germany, expressly prohibited by Allied peace agreements—Harry Armstrong’s institute would be shut down, Operation Paperclip would be exposed, and the U.S. Army would have an international scandal on its hands. The Nazi doctors’ trial was the first of the so-called subsequent trials to take place after the trial of the major war criminals at Nuremberg. It began on December 9, 1946. Unlike with the first trial, the twenty-three defendants at the doctors’ trial—twenty doctors and three SS bureaucrats—were virtually unknown figures in the eyes of the American public. What was known, from earlier press coverage, was that these proceedings would put lurid Nazi science on trial. In the words of chief prosecutor General Telford Taylor, Nazi doctors had become proficient in the “macabre science” of killing. Torturous medical experiments conducted on concentration camp prisoners included freezing experiments, high-altitude tests, mustard gas research, seawater drinkability tests, malaria research, mass sterilization, and euthanasia. The New York Times called the doctors’ crimes “beyond the pale of even the most perverted medicine” and cautioned that some details were difficult to report because they were impossible to comprehend. The New York Times cited one particularly grotesque example. Perfectly healthy people, “Jews and Slavs,” had been murdered at the request of SS physician Dr. August Hirt for a university skeleton collection of the Untermenschen. This was the same anatomist named by Dr. Eugen Haagen in papers discovered by Alsos officers in Strasbourg in November 1944. Hirt, an expert in dinosaur anatomy, had committed suicide before the trial. The defendants ran the gamut from “the dregs of the German medical profession” to doctors who had once been internationally esteemed, like Dr. Kurt Blome. On October 12, 1946, the Stars and Stripes newspaper, which operated from inside the Pentagon, listed the individual names of the doctors charged—a list that included the five Luftwaffe doctors who had been arrested at the U.S. Army Air", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:Operation Paperclip_cleaned.txt:173:889c3dd5dfc6", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 6086, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "Operation Paperclip_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/031622104X", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "Operation Paperclip_cleaned", "chunk_index": 174, "text": "Strasbourg in November 1944.

On October 12, 1946, the Stars and Stripes newspaper, which operated from inside the Pentagon, listed the individual names of the doctors charged—a list that included the five Luftwaffe doctors who had been arrested at the U.S. Army Air Forces Aero Medical Center: Theodor Benzinger, Siegfried Ruff, Konrad Schäfer, Hermann Becker-Freyseng, and Oskar Schröder. In a matter of weeks, these physicians had gone from being employed by the U.S. Army to being tried by the U.S. military for war crimes. The ultimate judicial punishment was on the line: Each doctor faced a possible death sentence. The following week, inside the prison complex at the Nuremberg Palace of Justice, there was a strange occurrence involving Dr. Benzinger. In Benzinger’s pretrial investigation he admitted being aware of the fact that medical experiments were taking place at concentration camps and that nonconsenting test subjects had been murdered in the process. Benzinger also admitted that he had attended the October 1942 conference in Nuremberg, “Medical Problems of Sea Distress and Winter Distress,” where data from murdered people was openly discussed among ninety Luftwaffe doctors. During Benzinger’s Nuremberg incarceration, prosecutors revealed to him that they had a new detail regarding his accessory to medical crimes, namely, the “motion picture of the record of the [medical murder] experiments” that had been shown at a private screening at the Air Ministry. Benzinger did not deny that he had been one of a select group of doctors invited by Himmler to attend this film screening; nor did he deny that he was one of nine persons chosen by Himmler to host the event. Benzinger was part of an elite inner circle of Luftwaffe doctors favored by the Reichsführer-SS, he conceded, but that was not a crime. But prosecutors also had a document that suggested Benzinger was far more implicated in the crimes than he let on. “After the showing of the film, most of the spectators withdrew and a small group of doctors remained behind [including] Benzinger. They asked Rascher… for a verbal report on the experiments,” the document read. Benzinger insisted that all he did was listen. That there was no evidence of his having participated in any of the medical murders and that there were no documents and no eyewitnesses that could prove otherwise. On October 12, 1946, Dr. Theodor Benzinger was announced as a defendant in the forthcoming doctors’ trial. And then, just eleven days later, on October 23, 1946, Benzinger was released from the Nuremberg prison without further explanation. He was returned directly to the custody of the Army Air Forces, as stated in his declassified Nuremberg prisoner file.

He was returned directly to the custody of the Army Air Forces, as stated in his declassified Nuremberg prisoner file. After spending a little over a month in the Nuremberg jail, Benzinger was back in Heidelberg continuing his U.S. Army research work. There was no explanation as to why Benzinger was dropped from the list of defendants in the upcoming doctors’ trial. It would take decades for an important clue to be revealed, by Nuremberg trial expert and medical history professor Paul Weindling. As it turned out, in the fall of 1946, Benzinger had recently completed a paper on pilot physiology concerning stratospheric, or extremely high-altitude, aircraft. “The US [Army] Air Forces, Wright Field circulated his report on this topic in October 1946—just weeks after his detention and release” from the prison complex at the Nuremberg Palace of Justice, Weindling explains. The suggestion is that perhaps someone in the Army Air Forces felt Benzinger’s expertise was more in the “national interest” than was trying him for war crimes. One of the Nuremberg prosecutors, a Boston attorney named Alexander G. Hardy, was outraged when he learned of Benzinger’s release and insisted that the “interrogations were sloppy.” Back at the AAF Aero Medical Center in Heidelberg, the arrests of the five doctors on war crimes charges had everyone on edge. The classified programs taking place there began to quietly wind down. While Doctors Ruff, Schäfer, Hermann Becker-Freyseng, and Schröder faced judgment at Nuremberg, thirty-four of the doctors remaining at the center prepared for shipment to the United States under Operation Paperclip. One of the first doctors in the group to head to America for work, in February 1947, was Dr. Theodor Benzinger. At Nuremberg, while the doctors from Heidelberg remained incarcerated in one wing of the prison awaiting trial, preparations of another kind were also going on. The trial of the major war criminals was over. On the morning of October 1, the judges took turns reading the verdicts: nineteen convictions and three acquittals of the twenty-two accused major war criminals (one, Bormann, in absentia). That same afternoon, the tribunal pronounced what sentences would be imposed: twelve death sentences, three life sentences, and four lengthy prison terms. Albert Speer, the only defendant who pled guilty, was sentenced to twenty years. The doctors from Heidelberg were housed in a separate wing of the prison where pretrial interviews would continue for another two months. Also in custody inside the prison complex at the Palace of Justice was Dr. Otto Ambros.

Ambros would be tried in a subsequent trial, Case VI or the Farben trial, which was scheduled to begin in the summer of 1947. As commandant of the facility, Colonel Burton Andrus was in charge of all prisoners, including those who were soon to be hanged. The condemned had roughly two weeks to live. Andrus described the surreal atmosphere of the last days at Nuremberg for the Nazis who had been sentenced to death. Ribbentrop, Kaltenbrunner, Frank, and Seyss-Inquart took communion and made a last confession to Father O’Conner, the Nuremberg priest. Göring bequeathed his shaving brush and razor to the prison barber. Streicher penned six letters. Ribbentrop read a book. Keitel requested that a German folk song be played on the organ as he was hanged. “On the night of 14th October, I made arrangements for the tightest security to be put around the prison,” Colonel Andrus recalled. “I wanted the condemned men to know only at the very last minute that their time had come to be hanged.” The Nuremberg gymnasium was chosen as the location where the executions would take place. Each night, the U.S. Army prison guards played basketball there to blow off steam. The night before the gallows were constructed Andrus allowed the usual game to go on. “Late at night,” remembered Andrus, “when the sweating players had trotted off to their showers, the grim-faced execution team passed through a door specially cut into the catwalk wall, and began their tasks in the gymnasium. A doorway had been cut into the blind side of the building so that no prisoner would see scaffolding being carried in.” The condemned prisoners were also shielded from seeing the stretchers that would soon carry their corpses away. While the gallows were being built, drama unfolded in the prison. Göring had requested death by firing squad instead of hanging—to be hanged was something he considered beneath him. His plea was considered by the Allied Control Commission and rejected. The night before he was to be hanged, Göring swallowed a brass-and-glass vial of potassium cyanide that he had skillfully managed to keep hidden for eighteen months. In a suicide note, he explained how he had managed to keep the vial hidden from guards by alternating its hiding place, from his anus to his flabby navel.

War crimes investigator Dr. Leopold Alexander would later learn that it was Dr. Rascher of the notorious Dachau experiments who had originally prepared Göring’s suicide vial for him. Shortly after midnight in the early morning hours of October 16, 1946, three sets of gallows had been built and painted black. Each had thirteen stairs leading up to a platform and crossbeam from which a noose with thirteen coils hung. The executioner was Master Sergeant John C. Woods, a man whose credentials included hanging 347 U.S. soldiers over a period of fifteen years for capitol crimes including desertion. At 1:00 a.m. Colonel Andrus read the names of the condemned out loud. After each name, a bilingual assistant said, “Tod durch den Strang,” or death by the rope. One by one the Nazis were hanged. At 4:00 a.m. the bodies were loaded onto two trucks and driven to a secret location just outside Munich. Here, at what was later revealed to be the Dachau concentration camp, the bodies of these perpetrators of World War II and the Holocaust were cremated in the camp’s ovens. Their ashes were raked out, scooped up, and thrown into a river. Some Nazis were hanged. Others now had lucrative new jobs. Many, like the four German doctors from the Army Air Forces Aero Medical Center at Heidelberg, now awaiting trial at Nuremberg, were in the gray area in between. Was the old German proverb true? Jedem das Seine. Does everyone get what he deserves? The same week that the major war criminals convicted at Nuremberg were hanged and their ashes thrown into a river, Undersecretary of State Dean Acheson called Samuel Klaus into his office at the State Department to discuss Operation Paperclip. At issue was the fact that JIOA had circulated a new Top Secret directive, JIOA 257/22. The way in which Paperclip participants’ would now receive visas had officially been changed. Instead of allowing State Department representatives to conduct preexaminations in Europe prior to visa issuance, as was required by law, that process would be completed here in America by the commissioner of the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS). “The Department of State would accept as final, the investigation and security reports prepared by JIOA, for insuring final clearance of individuals concerned,” wrote JIOA director Colonel Thomas Ford. Acheson and Klaus were both aware that JIOA had wrested control of how visas were issued and had done so in defiance of U.S. law. But the president had signed off on the directive.

Acheson and Klaus were both aware that JIOA had wrested control of how visas were issued and had done so in defiance of U.S. law. But the president had signed off on the directive. Operation Paperclip was now officially a “denial program,” meaning that any German scientist of potential interest to the Russians needed to be denied to the Russians, at whatever cost. There were now 233 Paperclip scientists in the United States in military custody. The State Department was told to expect to receive, in the coming months, their visa applications and those of their family members. The information contained within the scientists’ OMGUS security dossiers promised to be the “best information available.” Samuel Klaus knew this vague new language meant military intelligence officers could withhold damaging information about certain scientists from State Department officials. The pipeline to bring ardent Nazis and their families into the United States was open wide. Three weeks later the New York Times reported for the first time that there were Nazi scientists living in America under a secret military program. Its sources were the Russian army’s Berlin-based newspaper, Tägliche Rundschau, and the Russian-licensed East German newspaper Berliner Zeitung. In a follow-up article, an anonymous source told the newspaper that “one thousand additional German scientists” were on the way. “All were described as volunteers and under contract,” the article reported. “Their trial periods are generally six months, after which they can apply for citizenship and have their dependents brought to the United States.” Newsweek magazine revealed that the secret military program’s classified name was Project Paperclip. Rather than deny the story, the War Department decided to go public with a sanitized version of its program. They would also make several scientists at Wright Field “available to press, radio and pictorial services.” An open house was organized with army censors releasing details and photographs that would foster the appearance that all of the German scientists in the United States were benign. At Wright Field the “dirigible expert” Theodor Knacke gave a demonstration with a parachute. The eighty-year-old Hugo Eckener, former chairman of the Zeppelin Company, explained to reporters that thanks to his army contract he was now working with Goodyear on a new blimp design. Alexander Lippisch, inventor of the Messerschmitt Me 163 jet fighter, was photographed in a suit holding up a scale model of a sleek, futuristic, delta-wing jet, his hawkline nose staring down the end of the airplane.

The emphasis on Lippisch was not that his jet fighter held records for Allied shoot-downs in the war but that his aircraft set international records for speed. Ernst Eckert, an expert in jet fuels, discussed high-speed gas turbines in his thick German accent. It was by mistake that the War Department allowed Eckert to chat with reporters, considering that his JIOA file listed him as a Nazi ideologue and former member of the SS and the SA. The program was becoming unwieldy, and no matter how hard the JIOA tried to maintain control, they could not keep an eye on all things. One American officer, assigned as a spokesman for the Germans, told reporters he so enjoyed working with German scientists, “I wish we had more of them.” Other German scientists at Wright Field were kept away from reporters, particularly those men who had been members of Nazi Party paramilitary squads like the SA and the SS. In aerodynamicist Rudolf Hermann’s intelligence file, it was written that during the war, while working inside the wind tunnels in Kochel, Bavaria, Hermann had held morning roll calls in his brown SA uniform, and that he often gave speeches in support of Hitler. The information in engineer Emil Salmon’s OMGUS security report was even more incriminating. At the aircraft factory where he had worked, Salmon had been known to carry a rifle and wear an SS uniform. “He also belonged to the Storm Troops [sic] (SA) from 1933–1945 and held the position of Troop Leader (Truppfuehrer),” read one memo. When bringing him to America, the army stated, “This Command is cognizant of Mr. Salmon’s Nazi activities and certain allegations made by some of his associates in Europe,” namely, that during the war Emil Salmon had been involved in burning down a synagogue in his hometown of Ludwigshafen. But Emil Salmon was now at Wright Field because the Army Air Forces found his knowledge and expertise “difficult, if not impossible, to duplicate.” Emil Salmon built aircraft engine test stands. For various press events, the army provided photographs of some of the more wholesome-looking German scientists—definitely no one with a dueling scar. There were pictures of white-haired men playing chess, window-shopping outside a Dayton, Ohio, toy store, smoking cigarettes, and sunning themselves on army grounds.

The military placed its own article in the Stars and Stripes purporting to tell the official story: None of the Germans had ever been Nazis; the men were under strict supervision here in the United States; they were all outstanding scientists and technicians “vital to national security”; they were moral family men. The news stories about the scientists at Wright Field generated a flurry of response, including newspaper editorials and letters to congressmen. A Gallup Poll the following week revealed that most Americans believed that bringing one thousand more German scientists to America was a “bad idea.” Journalist and foreign affairs correspondent Joachim Joesten was outraged by the very idea of Paperclip, writing in the Nation, “If you enjoy mass murder, but also treasure your skin, be a scientist, son. It’s the only way, nowadays, of getting away with murder.” Rabbi Steven S. Wise, president of the American Jewish Congress, penned a scathing letter to Secretary of War Patterson that was made public. “As long as we reward former servants of Hitler, while leaving his victims in D. P. [displaced-persons] camps, we cannot even pretend that we are making any real effort to achieve the aims we fought for.” Eleanor Roosevelt became personally involved in protesting Operation Paperclip, organizing a conference at the Waldorf-Astoria hotel with Albert Einstein as honored guest. The former First Lady urged the United States government to suspend visas for all Germans for twelve years. When professors at Syracuse University learned that a new colleague, Dr. Heinz Fischer, an expert in infrared technology and a former member of the Nazi Party, had been sent by the army to work in one of their university laboratories under a secret military contract, they wrote an editorial for the New York Times. “We object not because they are citizens of an enemy nation, but because they were and probably still are Nazis.” The Society for the Prevention of World War III—a group of several thousand writers, artists, scholars, and journalists—did not mince words in their December journal. The group had been set up during the war to advocate for harsh punitive measures against a nation they perceived as inherently aggressive and militaristic, and against individuals they believed had substantially profited from the Nazi regime. “These German ‘experts’ performed wonders for the German war effort. Can one forget their gas chambers, their skill in cremation, their meticulous methods used to extract gold from the teeth of their victims, their wizardry in looting and thieving?” The society, which counted William L.

Shirer and Darryl Zanuck among its members, urged all fellow Americans to contact the War Department and demand that Hitler’s scientists be sent home. In the fall of 1946, of the 233 Nazi scientists in America, 140 were at Wright Field. With that many single men living together in isolation, the Hilltop became divided into social cliques. The Nazi businessman Albert Patin continued to serve as Colonel Putt’s ears and eyes among the Germans, reporting to Putt about the Germans’ needs and complaints. In this arrangement Patin wielded power at the Hilltop. With the arrival of former Mittelwerk general manager Georg Rickhey, in the summer of 1946, Albert Patin saw a business opportunity. Rickhey was a former employee of the Speer ministry. He served as the general manager of the Mittelwerk slave labor facility in Nordhausen where the V-2 rockets were built. Colonel Beasley of the United States Strategic Bombing Survey had evacuated Rickhey to London, and after that work was completed, Rickhey was hired to work at Wright Field. When asked by military intelligence officers what his job was, Rickhey said, “Giving my knowledge and experience in regard to planning, construction and operating underground factories.” Georg Rickhey was a tunnel engineer, and his value to the U.S. military was the knowledge he had gained while overseeing vast underground building projects for the Reich. A memo in Rickhey’s dossier, written by the army’s Office of the Deputy Director of Intelligence, kept his most powerful negotiating secret a secret: “He was in charge of all tunnel operations directly under Hitler’s headquarters in Berlin.” Georg Rickhey had overseen the building of the Führerbunker, where Hitler lived the last three months and two weeks of his life. With its more than thirty rooms, cryptlike corridors, multiple emergency exits, and hundreds of stairs, all located more than thirty feet under Berlin, the Führerbunker was considered an engineering tour de force. The army was impressed by how well Hitler’s Führerbunker had withstood years of heavy Allied bombing and was interested in learning from Georg Rickhey how to build similar underground command centers of its own. As the Cold War progressed, the U.S. Army would begin the secret construction of such facilities, notably ones that could continue to function in the aftermath of a chemical, biological, or nuclear attack. It would take decades for journalists to reveal that, starting in the early 1950s, several sprawling, multifloor, underground command centers had been secretly built for", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:Operation Paperclip_cleaned.txt:181:3d0757f8f8db", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 6094, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "Operation Paperclip_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/031622104X", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "Operation Paperclip_cleaned", "chunk_index": 182, "text": "of heavy Allied bombing and was interested in learning from Georg Rickhey how to build similar underground command centers of its own.

It would take decades for journalists to reveal that, starting in the early 1950s, several sprawling, multifloor, underground command centers had been secretly built for this purpose, including one in the Catoctin Mountains, called Raven Rock Mountain Complex, or Site R, and another in the Blue Ridge Mountains, called Mount Weather. Georg Rickhey’s expertise in underground engineering was not limited to the construction of the Führerbunker. During the war, he had also served as a director of the Reich’s Demag motorcar company, where he oversaw the construction of a massive underground facility where tanks had been assembled. And as general manager of the Mittelwerk, he oversaw the construction of the rocket assembly facility near Nordhausen. In his army intelligence dossier, it was noted that Rickhey had overseen the underground construction of more than 1,500,000 square feet of space. At Wright Field, Rickhey was meant to start consulting with American engineers on underground engineering projects for the army. But that work was slow and Rickhey was given a second job. Despite poor English skills, Rickhey was put in charge of examining V-2 documents captured at Nordhausen and, in his words, the “rendering of opinions on reports.” In the late summer of 1946 Albert Patin and Georg Rickhey started running a black market operation at the Hilltop, selling booze and cigarettes to their colleagues at premium prices. Rickhey had years of experience in wartime black market operations. Military intelligence would later learn that during the war, what little rations the slave laborers were allotted by the Speer ministry, Rickhey would sometimes sell off at a price. At Wright Field, Rickhey and Patin’s black market business quickly expanded, and the men enlisted outside assistance from Rickhey’s sister, Adelheid Rickhey, who was living in a hotel in New Jersey at the time. Adelheid Rickhey agreed to move to Ohio to help the men expand their black market business into Dayton and beyond. Because the Germans’ mail was monitored, it did not take long for the higher-ups at Wright Field to learn what was going on, but the Army Air Forces took no action against either man. The business continued into the fall of 1946, when it came to a head. In their private time Rickhey and Patin liked to gamble. They also liked to drink. The two men regularly hosted parties at the Hilltop, staying up late drinking and playing cards. One night, in the fall of 1946, a sixty-three-year-old German aircraft engineer named Hermann Nehlsen decided he had had enough.

The two men regularly hosted parties at the Hilltop, staying up late drinking and playing cards. One night, in the fall of 1946, a sixty-three-year-old German aircraft engineer named Hermann Nehlsen decided he had had enough. It was a little after midnight during the second week of October when Rickhey, Albert Patin, and a third man were playing cards. The noise woke up Hermann Nehlsen, who knocked on the door and told the three cardplayers to quiet down. After Nehlsen’s second request was ignored, he opened the door, walked into the room, and turned off the lamp on the card table. Rickhey, by Nehlsen’s account, was drunk. As Nehlsen was leaving, Rickhey lit a candle and laughed at his German colleague. A man “could still play cards with a good kosher candle,” Rickhey joked. The incident was a tipping point for Hermann Nehlsen, and he went to Colonel Putt to file a formal complaint against the two men. There was more to the story, Nehlsen told Colonel Putt. Rickhey was a war criminal. He had been the primary person behind a mass hanging at Nordhausen, the hanging by crane of a dozen prisoners, and had bragged about it on the ship ride coming over to the United States. As for Albert Patin, Hermann Nehlsen told Colonel Putt he was an ardent Nazi as well, a member of the SA. Patin’s companies used slave laborers from concentration camps. What Hermann Nehlsen did not know was that Colonel Putt was not interested in the past histories of the German scientists in the Army Air Forces’ employ. Or that Putt had a gentleman’s agreement with Albert Patin and had been using him to keep an eye on the other Germans at the Hilltop. Colonel Putt said he would look into the allegations. Instead, Putt had Nehlsen watched for future security violations. Hermann Nehlsen remained angry about the incident and wrote so in a letter to a friend in New York City named Erwin Loewy. Perhaps Nehlsen knew that all of his mail was read by military screeners, or maybe he did not. Either way, what Nehlsen wrote to Loewy caught the eye of Wright Field mail censors. Nehlsen’s letter was turned over to the intelligence division to be analyzed. Several weeks later, Hermann Nehlsen violated security and left Wright Field for a weekend visit with a relative in Michigan. Colonel Putt reported the violation to Air Material Command headquarters and arranged to have Nehlsen transferred to Mitchel Field, an air force base in New York.

Colonel Putt reported the violation to Air Material Command headquarters and arranged to have Nehlsen transferred to Mitchel Field, an air force base in New York. But Hermann Nehlsen’s letter to Erwin Loewy about Georg Rickhey had a life of its own. It made its way to Army Air Forces Headquarters, in Washington, D.C., where it was read by Colonel Millard Lewis, Executive Assistant Chief of Air Staff-2. The allegations were serious, Colonel Lewis decided. They involved alleged war crimes. Lewis sent a memorandum to the director of intelligence for the War Department General Staff summarizing the situation and advising that an investigating officer be assigned to look into the matter. “Mr. Nehlsen stated that Dr. Georg Rickhey, age 47, specialist in the field of engineering and production of guided missiles, was employed in the underground plant at Nordhausen as a strong Nazi Party member, where in 1944, twelve foreign workers were strung up on a cross beam and raised by a crane in the presence of the group of workers,” and killed, read Colonel Lewis’s memorandum. “One of the group who acted as an observer asserted that Dr. Rickhey was the chief instigator for the execution.” The Pentagon assigned an Air Corps Major named Eugene Smith to look into the Georg Rickhey case. Back at Wright Field, Colonel Putt likely believed that the allegations against Rickhey had fallen by the wayside. Meanwhile, Hermann Nehlsen had been banished to Mitchel Field. In January 1947 Putt recommended that Rickhey be given a long-term military contract for employment at Wright Field. That request was authorized, and on April 12, 1947, Georg Rickhey signed a new, five-year contract with the War Department. Separately, and without Putt’s knowledge, the Rickhey investigation was moving forward. At Army Air Forces Headquarters in Washington, Major Eugene Smith made preparations to travel to various military bases for interviews. It was Smith’s job to talk to Rickhey’s former colleagues from Nordhausen, to write up his findings, and to file a report. Colonel Putt did not learn about this investigation until Major Smith arrived at Wright Field. Putt suggested Major Smith discuss Rickhey’s case with Captain Albert Abels, the officer in charge of the Paperclip scientists at the Hilltop, so that Abels could clear things up. Abels told Major Smith that the stories were “petty jealousy” between scientists. Just gossip among men. Major Smith was unconvinced. He headed to Mitchel Field to interview Hermann Nehlsen and other German scientists who might have knowledge regarding the Rickhey case. Hermann Nehlsen stood by his original story. “In 1944, twelve foreign workers were simultaneously hanged by being strung up on a cross beam and raised by a crane in the presence", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:Operation Paperclip_cleaned.txt:184:57371211bc38", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 6097, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "Operation Paperclip_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/031622104X", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "Operation Paperclip_cleaned", "chunk_index": 185, "text": "Hilltop, so that Abels could clear things up.

Hermann Nehlsen stood by his original story. “In 1944, twelve foreign workers were simultaneously hanged by being strung up on a cross beam and raised by a crane in the presence of the workers,” Nehlsen swore in an affidavit. “Dr. Rickhey was the chief instigator for the execution,” meaning it was Rickhey’s idea to hang the men. A second witness emerged at Mitchel Field, a former engineer on the Nordhausen rocket assembly lines named Werner Voss. Voss also testified that Rickhey was involved in the hangings, and he provided important new details that added context to the executions. Shortly before the hangings, Voss said, British airplanes had dropped leaflets urging the Nordhausen slave laborers to revolt. A group of them did revolt, and those men were among the ones hanged. The execution was a public event, Voss said, meant to intimidate other slave workers into subservience. These were serious allegations of war crimes. Major Smith needed corroboration, and for that, he headed to Fort Bliss, Texas. Smith had been told by the army that he would be able interview Wernher von Braun as well as some of the other men who had worked closely with Georg Rickhey inside the Nordhausen tunnels. At Fort Bliss, in the evenings, the German rocket specialists gathered in a clubhouse built in a grove of cottonwood trees. There, they played cards while drinking American cocktails and beer. They strung hammocks between the trees and enjoyed balmy desert nights. Once a month, most of the Germans went into El Paso as a group to shop and have a restaurant meal. The nightmarish environment at Nordhausen, which the majority of the rocket engineers had participated in, must have seemed like another world—until Major Smith arrived to take official depositions for the U.S. Army and ask the men to recollect what those days had been like. Major Smith’s first interviews would be with Wernher von Braun and his brother Magnus von Braun. But after Major Smith arrived at Fort Bliss, he was told that both von Braun brothers were out of town. Smith interviewed Günther Haukohl instead. Haukohl had been the original designer of the Nordhausen rocket assembly line and, like Wernher von Braun, was an officer with the SS. Günther Haukohl told Major Smith that he had no clear memories about what happened in the tunnels in the last months of the war, but, yes, prisoners were abused. Rickhey’s involvement is “probably a rumor,” Haukohl said. V-2 engineers Hans Palaoro and Rudolph Schlidt seconded Haukohl’s position, repeating the idea that the end of the war was nothing but", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:Operation Paperclip_cleaned.txt:185:e85d76346ff5", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 6098, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "Operation Paperclip_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/031622104X", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "Operation Paperclip_cleaned", "chunk_index": 186, "text": "been the original designer of the Nordhausen rocket assembly line and, like Wernher von Braun, was an officer with the SS.

Rickhey’s involvement is “probably a rumor,” Haukohl said. V-2 engineers Hans Palaoro and Rudolph Schlidt seconded Haukohl’s position, repeating the idea that the end of the war was nothing but a blur. Engineer Erich Ball, who also worked on the rocket assembly lines at Nordhausen, told Major Smith that he had witnessed two sets of prisoner hangings in the tunnels but that Georg Rickhey had not been involved in either of them. Major Smith accepted that the men might not be able to remember details about what had gone on, but surely as engineers they could remember the layout of the facility. Smith asked Haukohl, Schlidt, Palaoro, and Ball to use their engineers’ precision and help him create an accurate illustration of the work spaces inside the Nordhausen tunnels, including where the rockets were assembled and where the hangings occurred. This was an important artifact for the investigation. Next, Major Smith interviewed the former Mittelwerk operations director Arthur Rudolph. Like Georg Rickhey, Arthur Rudolph had authority over the Mittelwerk’s Prison Labor Supply office, which was the unit responsible for getting food rations to the slave laborers. In his interview, Arthur Rudolph first denied ever seeing prisoners abused. Major Smith showed Arthur Rudolph the illustration that had been drawn by Rudolph’s Nordhausen colleagues Haukohl, Schlidt, Palaoro, and Ball. Major Smith pointed out to Arthur Rudolph that Rudolph’s office was directly adjacent to where the twelve so-called political prisoners had been hanged from the crane. As Arthur Rudolph continued to deny ever seeing prisoners abused, Smith found his testimony increasingly suspicious. Everyone else interviewed admitted to having seen some prisoner abuse. Rudolph was adamant: “I did not see them punished, beaten, hung or shot,” he told Major Smith. Smith approached the question in a different manner. He asked Rudolph if he could recall anything about the twelve men who had been hanged from the crane. This public execution, Smith said, had been confirmed by many of Rudolph’s colleagues, and Smith was trying to put together an accurate portrait of what had happened, and when. Rudolph replied, “[O]ne [dying prisoner] lifted his knees, after I got there.” In other words, Rudolph had witnessed the executions. Major Smith was now convinced that the truth about what happened at Nordhausen was being covered up, collectively, by the group, and that Arthur Rudolph knew a lot more than he let on. But as Smith noted in his report, the subject of the investigation was Georg Rickhey, not Arthur Rudolph. “Mr. Rudolph impressed the undersigned as a very clever, shrewd individual,” Smith wrote. “He did not wish", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:Operation Paperclip_cleaned.txt:186:4965a7e9e110", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 6099, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "Operation Paperclip_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/031622104X", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "Operation Paperclip_cleaned", "chunk_index": 187, "text": "after I got there.” In other words, Rudolph had witnessed the executions.

In Germany, a serendipitous incident occurred at this same time. William Aalmans, the Dutch citizen who had been working on the U.S. War Crimes Investigation Team, had been hunting down SS officers from Dora-Nordhausen for an upcoming regional war crimes trial. Aalmans had managed to locate only eleven out of three thousand SS officers who had run the concentration camp. Aalmans was the man who had interviewed many of the newly liberated prisoners back in April 1945, and he was also the individual who had found the Mittelwerk employee telephone list tacked to the tunnel wall. The two names at the top of that list were Georg Rickhey and Arthur Rudolph. Aalmans had no idea that both men had been recruited into Operation Paperclip. In Germany, no one Aalmans interviewed claimed to know the whereabouts of either man. Then, one afternoon in May 1947, Aalmans was taking a break from his Nazi hunting work, reading the Stars and Stripes newspaper in the sunshine, when, as he told journalist Tom Bower decades later, “I just saw a tiny headline, ‘German Scientist Applies for American Citizenship.’” The name mentioned was Georg Rickhey, Aalmans explained. “I screamed for joy and rushed into the head office shouting, ‘We’ve found him!’” Within three days the Georg Rickhey matter had been escalated to the attention of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. On May 19, 1947, an arrest warrant was issued for Georg Rickhey on orders from the War Crimes Branch, Civil Affairs Division, in Washington. “Georg Rickhey is wanted as a principal perpetrator in the Nordhausen Concentration Camp Case,” the document read. Rickhey’s immediate reaction was to claim he was being falsely accused. This was a case of mistaken identity, Rickhey declared. In response, the Office of the Deputy Director of Intelligence, Headquarters, European Command, had this to say: “The Dr. Georg Rickhey now employed at Wright Field and the Georg Rickhey engineer at Nordhausen are one and the same person.

This Group is making arrangements to have Rickhey returned to Germany for trial in the Nordhausen Concentration camp case.” The War Department’s Intelligence Division assigned the chief of security at Wright Field, Major George P. Miller, the role of escorting Rickhey back to Germany. Rickhey’s five-year contract was terminated. He was instead going to be a defendant in the Dora-Nordhausen war crimes trial. On June 2, 1947, JIOA deputy director Bosquet N. Wev wrote to J. Edgar Hoover, the powerful director of the FBI, alerting him of the situation and sending along Rickhey’s classified dossier. If the public learned that an Operation Paperclip scientist had been returned to Germany to stand trial for war crimes, the JIOA, the Army, the War Department, and the FBI would all have a lot of explaining to do. It was in everyone’s interest to keep the Georg Rickhey fiasco under wraps. On August 7, 1947, Georg Rickhey appeared as one of nineteen defendants in the Dora-Nordhausen trial. The Nazis were charged with the deaths of at least twenty thousand laborers who were beaten, tortured, starved, hanged, or worked to death while being forced to build V-2 rockets. The trial, which took place inside a former SS barracks adjacent to the Dachau concentration camp, lasted four months and three weeks. The prosecution requested that Wernher von Braun be allowed to testify at the trial, but the army said it was too much of a security risk to allow von Braun to travel to Germany. The Russians could kidnap him, the U.S. Army said. They did not say that von Braun had recently traveled to Germany to marry his cousin and bring her back to Texas with him. At the end of the trial, fifteen of the nineteen defendants were found guilty. Four, including Georg Rickhey, were acquitted. “Then, in an unprecedented move, the Army classified the entire trial record,” explains journalist Linda Hunt. The record would remain secret from the public for another forty years. There was far too much at stake for the U.S. Army to allow the information about what had really gone on in the Nordhausen tunnel complex to get out to the public.

The Russians had their rocket scientists and America needed hers, too. “After exchanged pleasantries, [Cox] inquired if we had ever returned a specialist to Europe for trial. I thought a moment and, realizing that the Rickhey case was in the public domain and in all probability facts known to the State Department since his sister made inquiries, I did not dare deny the story. I, therefore, told Mr. Cox that one Air Force case had been returned to Europe under suspicion, that my recollection was he was cleared; that in any event we did not desire to take further chances on the case and that he had not been returned to the United States.” The State Department appeared to have bought the story. Rickhey was gone, but there was no shortage of Nazis coming to Wright Field to work. On August 22, 1947, one of the Reich’s top ten pilots, Siegfried Knemeyer, arrived. This was the daring pilot and engineer whom Albert Speer had hoped would help him to escape to Greenland and whom Hermann Göring had called “my boy.” “Knemeyer is very popular with his fellow nationals since he is a good mixer and free of vanity,” read a memo in his intelligence dossier. “He is a diligent worker with an inventive mind. He is absorbed by his work and especially enthusiastic about participating in aerial tests.” Soon Knemeyer’s wife, Doris, and their seven children arrived in America to join him and to become U.S. citizens. The family moved into a large, drafty farmhouse on Yellow Springs Road. Doris Knemeyer hated provincial life in Dayton, Ohio. In Berlin, the Knemeyers had a grand home in the Charlottenburg district, with many servants to help take care of the Knemeyer brood. Raising seven children by herself in America was not what Doris Knemeyer had in mind. The difficulties at home did not go unnoticed by Knemeyer’s supervisors at Wright Field. “Since the arrival of his family he seems harassed and neglectful of his personal appearance,” read an internal security report. But Knemeyer was determined to succeed. Assigned to the Communication and Navigation Laboratory at Wright Field, Knemeyer found his stride. He began to make significant contributions to navigational instruments for his new employer, the U.S. Air Force— no longer part of the army anymore. Knemeyer is “a genius in the creation of new concepts in flight control,” wrote Colonel John Martin, Knemeyer’s superior at the lab.", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:Operation Paperclip_cleaned.txt:189:dd88594e8aa3", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 6102, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "Operation Paperclip_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/031622104X", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "Operation Paperclip_cleaned", "chunk_index": 190, "text": "he seems harassed and neglectful of his personal appearance,” read an internal security report.

Knemeyer is “a genius in the creation of new concepts in flight control,” wrote Colonel John Martin, Knemeyer’s superior at the lab. Knemeyer’s friend Werner Baumbach, Hitler’s general of the bombers, had been scheduled to come to Wright Field to work alongside Knemeyer, but an entry in Baumbach’s intelligence dossier noted that there had been a last-minute change: “Lt. Colonel Baumbach has since been substituted,” it read. Baumbach went to Argentina instead, to train fighter pilots for Juan Perón. Whether he had been dropped from Operation Paperclip or Juan Perón had offered him a better deal remains a mystery. Werner Baumbach died a few years later after an airplane he was testing crashed into the Río de la Plata, near Uruguay. Also arriving at Wright Field in the summer of 1947 was General Walter Dornberger, newly released from England’s Special Camp XI, outside Bridgend, South Wales (formerly Island Farm). Before turning General Dornberger over to the Americans, the British labeled him a “menace of the first order” and warned their Allied partners of his deceitful nature. While holding Dornberger for war crimes, British intelligence had eavesdropped on him and recorded what he said. When the Americans listened to these secret audio recordings, they, too, concluded that Hitler’s former “chief of all rocket and research development” had “an untrustworthy attitude in seeking to turn ally against ally.” Still, Dornberger signed a Paperclip contract, on July 12, 1947, just weeks after his release from prison. Dornberger’s skill at manipulation was put to use by Army Ordnance, which had him write classified intelligence briefs. America needed to develop missiles regardless of what any naysayers might think, Dornberger believed. “Russia strives now only for time to prepare for war before the United States,” Dornberger wrote in a classified budget pitch, financed by the Ordnance Department, in 1948. “The United States must decide upon a research and development program that will guarantee satisfactory results within the shortest possible time and at the least expense. Such a program must be set up even if its organization appears to violate American economic ideals and American traditions in arms development,” Dornberger wrote. At least it could be said that Dornberger remained true to his totalitarian-leaning principles—his belief that democratic ideals and traditions could be ignored in the quest for military supremacy.

A copy of the classified document was found in 2012 in Dornberger’s personal papers kept in a German state archive. Opposition to Operation Paperclip gained momentum with America’s scientific elite. On February 1, 1947, the Federation of American Scientists (FAS) met in New York City to ask President Truman to put an end to it. The American scientists saw the Nazi scientist program as a “drastic step in the search for military power.” When it was learned that some of the one thousand additional German scientists on the Paperclip recruiting list were being hired for short-term military work followed by longer-term positions at American universities, many were outraged. “Certainly not wishing to jeopardize the legitimate needs of the national defense, and not advocating the policy of hatred and vengeance toward our former enemies, we nevertheless believe that a large-scale importation of German scientists… is not in keeping with the best objectives of American domestic and foreign policy,” the members of FAS wrote. One American scientist was more forthright. “Certainly any person who can transfer loyalties from one idealology [sic] to another upon the shifting of a meal ticket is not better than Judas!” he said. Another important figure among the opposition was the nuclear physicist Hans Bethe. Bethe had fled Nazi Germany in 1933 and had worked on the Manhattan Project during the war. In the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists, Bethe and Dr. Henri Sack, a colleague from Cornell University, posed a series of simple questions about Operation Paperclip. “Was it wise, or even compatible with our moral standards to make this bargain, in light of the fact that many of the Germans, probably the majority, were die-hard Nazis?” Bethe and Sack asked. “Did the fact that the Germans might save the nation millions of dollars imply that permanent residence and citizenship could be bought? Could the United States count on [the German scientists] to work for peace when their indoctrinated hatred against the Russians might contribute to increase the divergency between the great powers? Had the war been fought to allow Nazi ideology to creep into our educational and scientific institutions by the back door?” Their final question struck at the dark heart of the Nazi scientist program. “Do we want science at any price?” The condemnation of Operation Paperclip by these leading American scientists and others had a ripple effect on the general public.

Reporters began searching for leads about individual German scientists’ wartime activities, but this proved an almost impossible effort given the program’s classified nature. Frustrated by the lack of information, some Americans sent threatening letters addressed to the German scientists at Wright Field and Fort Bliss. The army tightened security and surveillance. In Washington, D.C., the War Department was rightly concerned that intense opposition and bad publicity had put the entire program in jeopardy of collapse, and in the winter of 1947 the War Department forbade the further release of information about the program. Despite the precautions, two individuals from the program at Fort Bliss were exposed by an angry public as “real Nazis”: Mr. and Mrs. Herbert Axster. Herbert Axster, a former lieutenant colonel in the Wehrmacht, had been a Nazi Party member since 1940. He was not a scientist but rather a patent lawyer and an accountant. At Peenemünde he worked as General Dornberger’s chief of staff. His wife, Ilse Axster, was a leader of NS-Frauenschaft, a Nazi Party organization for women. During a routine investigation of the Axsters conducted for their visa applications, neighbors in Germany told army intelligence officers that Mrs. Axster was a particularly sadistic Nazi. On the Axsters’ estate, the neighbors said, the couple kept forty “political prisoners,” Russians and Poles, whom they used as slave laborers. The neighbors said Mrs. Axster was known to use a horsewhip on her servants. This information was first passed on to Rabbi Stephen Wise of the American Jewish Congress and then to the press. “These scientists and their families are supposed to have been ‘screened,’ Wise wrote to the War Department. “The Axsters prove that this ‘screening’ is a farce and the War Department ‘screeners’ are entirely incapable of performing this task.” The Department of Justice withdrew Herbert Axster’s application for legal immigration, but the Axsters were not sent home. Eventually they left Fort Bliss and Herbert Axster opened a law firm in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. The doctors’ trial was the first of twelve subsequent war crimes trials at Nuremberg wherein the U.S. government prosecuted individuals in specific professions—including industrialists, lawyers, and generals—who had served the Third Reich. The first trial, called the trial of the major war criminals, was prosecuted by the four Allied powers. When it ended, in October 1946, tensions between the Soviet Union and the United States had escalated to the degree that cooperation between the two nations was no longer possible.

When it ended, in October 1946, tensions between the Soviet Union and the United States had escalated to the degree that cooperation between the two nations was no longer possible. The subsequent twelve trials took place at the Palace of Justice, as the others had, but with only American judges and prosecutors. The twenty-three defendants in the doctors’ trial were charged with murder, torture, conspiracy, and atrocity in the name of medical science. “Mere punishment of the defendants,” said Brigadier General Telford Taylor in his opening statement, “can never redress the terrible injuries which the Nazis visited on these unfortunate peoples.” But General Taylor reminded the tribunal and the world that one of the central purposes of the trial was to establish a record of proof of the crimes, “so that no one can ever doubt that they were fact and not fable; and that this court, as agent of the United States and as the voice of humanity, stamps these acts, and the ideas which engendered them, as barbarous and criminal.” Dr. Leopold Alexander, the Viennese-born American psychiatrist who had first learned of the Luftwaffe freezing experiments, helped General Taylor write his opening speech. Dr. Alexander’s official title was expert consultant to the secretary of war, but in layman’s terms he was the most influential person involved in the doctors’ trial after Telford Taylor. Dr. Alexander worked tirelessly to supply information and answers for the prosecution team as they prepared to go to trial. He conducted hundreds of hours of pretrial interrogations with the defendants and interviewed scores of witnesses and victims. He was able to converse in both German and English and he took extensive notes in both languages. Throughout the trial Dr. Alexander delivered presentations of evidence and cross-examined witnesses. When the trial was over he would be given credit for writing the Nuremberg Code. Of the twenty-three defendants, no one outside a small group of American medical military elite had any idea that four of the accused had already worked for the U.S. Army under Paperclip. This fact would remain secret for forty years. Neither Siegfried Ruff, nor Konrad Schäfer, Hermann Becker-Freyseng, nor Oskar Schröder mentioned this damning fact during the trial. Siegfried Ruff was one of the few physicians who admitted he’d overseen the medical murders at Dachau but said he did not perform any of the experiments himself. In his defense, he said he didn’t believe that what he did was wrong. “It was understood that concentration camp inmates who had been condemned to death would be used in the experiments, and as compensation they were to have their sentences commuted to life", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:Operation Paperclip_cleaned.txt:193:9d6d8e66c865", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 6106, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "Operation Paperclip_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/031622104X", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "Operation Paperclip_cleaned", "chunk_index": 194, "text": "mentioned this damning fact during the trial.

The strange case of Konrad Schäfer played a unique role in Operation Paperclip. Having invented the Schäfer process to separate salt from seawater, Schäfer was clearly aware that concentration camp prisoners were going to be used in the testing process. Schäfer’s superior, Oskar Schröder, chief of medical services for the Luftwaffe, confirmed this under oath, “In May 1944, in order to discuss what further steps should be taken, Becker-Freyseng and Schäfer attended [a] meeting as representatives of my office. As a result of the meeting it was decided to conduct further experiments on human beings being supplied by the Reichsführer-SS, Heinrich Himmler.” It was Becker-Freyseng who drew up the letter, which was sent to Himmler, requesting more prisoners to conduct experiments on. But Schäfer said he never actually went to Dachau and no evidence placing him there survived the war. As for eyewitness testimony, all but one of the saltwater experiment victims had been killed. The sole survivor, Karl Höllenrainer, was located by Dr. Alexander and put on the witness stand. Höllenrainer did not recognize Konrad Schäfer but he recognized one of his codefendants in the dock. Höllenrainer’s testimony proved to be one of the most dramatic events in the doctors’ trial. Höllenrainer’s crime was that he had fallen in love with and married a German girl, a violation of the infamous Nuremberg law that prohibited a non-Aryan from marrying or having sexual relations with a German citizen. After being arrested, Höllenrainer was sent to three different concentration camps, first Auschwitz, then Buchenwald, and finally Dachau, where he was selected to take part in the seawater experiments being performed by Luftwaffe. At Dachau, Höllenrainer was deprived of food, forced to drink chemically processed seawater, and then monitored for signs of liver failure and madness. One experiment among the many stood out in his memory. Without using anesthesia, a Luftwaffe doctor had removed a piece of Karl Höllenrainer’s liver in order to analyze it. Now, from the witness stand, Höllenrainer was asked to identify the Nazi doctor who’d performed this liver puncture on him. Höllenrainer stared across the courtroom, his eyes focused sharply on one of the twenty-three defendants sitting in the dock, Dr.", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:Operation Paperclip_cleaned.txt:194:117750282c9f", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 6107, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "Operation Paperclip_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/031622104X", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "Operation Paperclip_cleaned", "chunk_index": 195, "text": "seawater, and then monitored for signs of liver failure and madness.

Now, from the witness stand, Höllenrainer was asked to identify the Nazi doctor who’d performed this liver puncture on him. Höllenrainer stared across the courtroom, his eyes focused sharply on one of the twenty-three defendants sitting in the dock, Dr. Wilhelm Beiglböck, 40, the Luftwaffe doctor in charge of the saltwater experiments. Beiglböck had deep crevices at each side of his mouth and five pronounced dueling scars running across his left cheek. As Höllenrainer stared at Dr. Beiglböck, “everyone in the courtroom waited tensely,” recalls Vivien Spitz, a young American court reporter whose job it was to take down the testimony. Spitz sat in front of the judges, within clear view of the witnesses and defendants. Höllenrainer “was a little man and I watched him stand up,” she explains. The prosecutor asked Höllenrainer to proceed to the defendants’ dock to identify the doctor who’d removed a piece of his liver without anesthesia. Karl Höllenrainer sprang into action. To Vivien Spitz’s eye, Höllenrainer seemed to leap over the German defense counsels’ tables and “appeared to be almost flying through the air toward the prisoners’ dock.” In his right hand, stretched up high in the air, Karl Höllenrainer clutched a dagger, Vivien Spitz recalls. “He was reaching for Dr. Beiglböck, the consulting physician to the German Air Force.” There was shock in the courtroom. Confusion and mayhem. The Nazis’ defense attorneys scrambled to get out of Höllenrainer’s way. Three American military police rushed forward and grabbed Höllenrainer. Vivien Spitz remembers how security “subdued” Karl Höllenrainer just before he reached Beiglböck, “preventing him from delivering his own brand of justice.” It took minutes for order to be restored in the courtroom. The military police set Karl Höllenrainer before Presiding Judge Walter Beals, who was furious. Seventy years old, overworked and in failing health, Judge Beals clung to the idea that his primary role at Nuremberg was to educate the German people in the ways of American democracy and due process. Karl Höllenrainer spoke in a tidy, pleading voice. The power and conviction that had allowed him to almost fly across the courtroom with the intent of stabbing Dr. Beiglböck with his dagger was gone. Now Höllenrainer was on the edge of tears. “Would the Tribunal please forgive me?” Höllenrainer asked. “I am married and I have a small son.” He pointed at Dr. Beiglböck. “This man is a murderer. He gave me salt water and he performed a liver puncture on me. I am still under medical treatment.” Karl Höllenrainer pleaded for mercy from Judge Beals. “Please, do not send me to prison.” “My heart broke,” Vivien Spitz recalls.

I am still under medical treatment.” Karl Höllenrainer pleaded for mercy from Judge Beals. “Please, do not send me to prison.” “My heart broke,” Vivien Spitz recalls. All she could do was lower her head. She was a professional court reporter and it was inappropriate for anyone to see that she was crying. Sixty years later, when recollecting the incident, she still wondered why Judge Beals did what he did. “It was impossible to be dispassionate.… Why ninety days? Why not one or two days—just to make a point? After all the torture the witness had suffered it seemed to me to be an outrageous elevation of process over substance.” Karl Höllenrainer was removed from the courtroom. He was led down a long, secure corridor and into the prison complex, the same location where Dr. Beiglböck and all of the other Nazi war criminals were being held. It had been Dr. Alexander who had made the decision to put Karl Höllenrainer on the witness stand, and in his journal he wrote about how conflicted he felt about his decision. Dr. Alexander had spoken with Höllenrainer ten days before he testified against Beiglböck and was aware how upset Höllenrainer was, noting in a report how his hands shook. Karl Höllenrainer shared with Dr. Alexander that he suffered from a “tremendous feeling of inner rage” whenever he thought about what had happened to him at the Dachau concentration camp. Höllenrainer felt powerless, he said. He could close his eyes and “see the doctor in front of him who… had ruined his life and killed three of his friends.” Dr. Alexander knew how powerful Höllenrainer’s testimony would be. He was the only known victim of the saltwater experiments to have survived. Witness testimony was powerful, as his proved to be. The thought of him being confined in a prison with the very doctors who had tortured him was unacceptable to Dr. Alexander, and that night he went to Judge Beals to advocate on Höllenrainer’s behalf. The judge showed clemency and released him, on bail, into Alexander’s custody. Four days later, on July 1, 1947, Karl Höllenrainer was allowed to continue his testimony. He rose to the occasion and provided harrowing details about what dying of thirst does to a man. He described how his friends “foamed at the mouth.” How “they had fits of raving madness” before succumbing to an agonizing death. The exchange could have served as a metaphor for the whole trial. Through the eyes of a Nazi it was and always would be the Übermenschen versus the Untermenschen.

Through the eyes of a Nazi it was and always would be the Übermenschen versus the Untermenschen. It was why General Taylor’s opening remarks sent such a powerful message. It wasn’t just the acts of the Nazi doctors that were “barbarous and criminal” but the very ideas that had engendered such acts. Late at night, Dr. Alexander wrote a private letter to General Telford Taylor stating how he felt about the Nazi doctors on trial. “I feel that all of the accused today, Schaefer, Becker-Freyseng and Beiglböck, would admit that this problem [seawater drinkability] could have been solved in one afternoon with a piece of jelly [and] a salt solution.” Instead, Dr. Alexander wrote, “All of these men on the dock slaughtered for gain of scientific renown [and] personal advancement. They were like Tantalus, a mythical, ambitious ruler who slew his own child for reward.” In a letter to his wife, Dr. Alexander penned a fascinating reveal: “Dr. Beiglböck from Vienna, turns out to have been in the same class with me during our final year at medical school,” before the war. The way Dr. Alexander remembered it, Beiglböck was caught cheating and had to leave the school. “He does not recognize me,” Dr. Alexander told his wife, “but I regularly recognize him.” Two men whose professional lives had begun so similarly had taken such radically diffent paths. There was another dramatic turning point in the doctors’ trial, and that involved the case of Dr. Kurt Blome. Blome was admittedly the director of biological weapons research for the Reich, which was not in itself a crime. But there were scores of documents in which Blome discussed the need to conduct experiments on human beings so as to further plague research at the Bacteriological Institute in Posen, where he was in charge. Blome’s defense, some of which he argued himself, was that he intended to experiment on humans but that he never actually performed the experiments. Intent, said Blome, was not a crime. The prosecution had been unable to find any witnesses to testify against Blome, and Blome used this fact in his defense.

There was the testimony of Major General Walter Schreiber against Blome from the first Nuremberg trial, but the Soviets had refused to let Dr. Alexander interview Dr. Schreiber himself, so the veracity of his testimony was never independently verified. The prosecution presented many documents in which Blome discussed with Himmler his plans to experiment on humans. But there were no documents showing Blome’s actual guilt. There was another element of Blome’s defense that the prosecution was completely unprepared for, and that was Dr. Blome’s wife, Bettina, a physician and bestselling author. Frau Blome meticulously researched experiments that were conducted by the U.S. Office of Scientific Research and Development (OSRD) during the war. This included malaria experiments on Terre Haute federal prison inmates. She also uncovered Dr. Walter Reed’s famous nineteenth-century yellow fever research for the U.S. Army, in which volunteer human test subjects had died. The defense counsel, Robert Servatius, picked up on this theme of U.S. Army human experimentation where Blome’s wife left off. Servatius had located a Life magazine article, published in June of 1945, that described how OSRD conducted experiments on eight hundred U.S. prisoners during the war. Servatius read the entire article, word for word, in the courtroom. None of the American judges was familiar with the article, nor were most members of the prosecution, and its presentation in court clearly caught the Americans off guard. Because the article specifically discussed U.S. Army wartime experiments on prisoners, it was incredibly damaging for the prosecution. “Prison life is ideal for controlled laboratory work with humans,” Servatius read, quoting American doctors who had been interviewed by Life reporters. The idea that extraordinary times call for extraordinary measures, and that both nations had used human test subjects during war, was unsettling. It pushed the core Nazi concept of the Untermenschen to the side. The Nuremberg prosecutors were left looking like hypocrites. On August 6, 1947, the verdicts were read. Seven defendants were given death sentences, and nine were given prison sentences of between ten years and life, including Beiglböck (fifteen years), Becker-Freyseng (twenty years), and Schröder (life). Seven Nazi doctors were acquitted, including Blome, Schäfer, Ruff, and Weltz. Of Blome’s acquittal, the Nuremberg judges noted, “It may well be that defendant Blome was preparing to experiment on human beings in connection with bacteriological warfare, but the record fails to disclose that fact, or that he ever actually conducted the experiments.” America as part of Operation Paperclip and was now in Texas, serving as “professional advisor” to Colonel Armstrong, the commandant of the School of Aviation Medicine at Randolph Field.

Hubertus Strughold’s job description also included “overall supervision of the professional activities of the German and Austrian scientists [to be] employed by the School.” Meanwhile, the FBI was having difficulty getting approval for Strughold’s visa application for immigration into the United States. The Bureau had conducted a special inquiry into Dr. Strughold back in Germany. “One informant, who had known the subject,” investigators learned, said that Strughold “had expressed the opinion that the Nazi party had done a great deal for Germany. He [Strughold] said that prior to Nazism, the Jews had crowded the medical schools and it had been nearly impossible for others to enroll.” To counterbalance this derogatory depiction of Strughold, Dr. Konrad Schäfer was asked to write a letter of recommendation for his former boss. In a sworn statement written just a few weeks after Schäfer was acquitted at Nuremberg, Schäfer praised Dr. Strughold for his “ethical principles” while conducting research work. “I also know that he strictly refused to take part [in] or permit scientific research work which was damaging to human health,” Schäfer wrote. The following year, Dr. Konrad Schäfer would be on a boat headed for America, an Operation Paperclip contract in hand. As for Dr. Blome, he was seen as a highly desirable recruit for Operation Paperclip. Blome allegedly knew more about bubonic plague research than anyone else in the world. But, given his former position in Hitler’s inner circle, coupled with the fact that Blome had worn the Golden Party Badge, bringing him to America as part of Operation Paperclip remained too difficult for the U.S. Army to justify. But as the Cold War gained momentum and intense suspicion of the Soviets increased, even someone like Kurt Blome would eventually be deemed eligible for Operation Paperclip. It had been nearly a year since State-War-Navy Coordinating Committee Paper No. 275/5 authorized JIOA to import one thousand Nazi scientists from Germany so as to deny them to the Russians. For the JIOA, things were not happening nearly fast enough. The number of Operation Paperclip scientists who had come to America in this time frame had nearly doubled, from 175 in March 1946 to 344 in February 1947, but none of these scientists had been granted visas yet. JIOA officials perceived State Department official Samuel Klaus to be the man most responsible for the holdup.

JIOA officials perceived State Department official Samuel Klaus to be the man most responsible for the holdup. On February 27, 1947, Klaus was called into a meeting in the Pentagon with his military counterparts. There, JIOA director Colonel Thomas Ford told Klaus that he had a list of German scientists already in the United States whose visas needed to be expedited. He asked Samuel Klaus to sign a waiver that would allow JIOA to begin this process. Klaus refused to rubber-stamp anything. “I told him that of course I could do no such thing and that certification presupposed that the Department should have an opportunity to pass judgment of some kind before affixing the signature,” he wrote in a State Department memo. Colonel Ford reminded Klaus of the language in a recent JIOA directive dated September 3, 1946. According to the directive, the Department of State was to “accept as final the investigation and security reports prepared by JIOA, for insuring final clearance of individuals concerned.” Klaus told Ford that he would not sign a document that was essentially a blanket waiver of anything—that he would have to see the list of scientists first. Ford told Klaus that the list was classified and that he did not have the clearance to see it. Klaus still refused to sign off on it. “Ford stated in various ways that if I did not accept the paper on behalf of the State Department he would give the information to several senators who would take care of the Department,” Klaus wrote of Ford’s threat. Colonel Ford accused him of standing in the way of “national interest.” Colonel Ford’s request was likely influenced by information the JIOA had recently received from the Office of the Military Government in Germany. After months of negative press attention directed at Operation Paperclip, spearheaded by the Federation of American Scientists and given further momentum by the American Jewish Congress’s having identified the Axsters, of Fort Bliss, as “real Nazis,” the War Department had asked OMGUS to conduct an internal review of the Operation Paperclip scientists working in the United States. It was OMGUS in Germany that oversaw the reports on all the German scientists issued by Army Intelligence, G-2. The War Department told OMGUS that it did not want to have to deal with any other exposés. In response, OMGUS sent the War Department 146 security reports that could potentially create scandals were the information contained in them to be revealed.

One report pertained to rocket engineer Kurt Debus. Debus was an ardent Nazi. He had been an active SS member who, according to the testimony of colleagues, wore his Nazi uniform to work. Most troublesome was the revelation in his OMGUS security report that during the war he had turned a colleague, an engineering supervisor named Richard Craemer, over to the Gestapo for making anti-Nazi remarks and for refusing to give Debus the Nazi salute. From Nazi-era paperwork, it was clear that Debus had initiated the investigation into Craemer. No one else had heard the conversation between the two scientists; Debus had gone home after work and taken it upon himself to write up a report of what was allegedly said, which he had then submitted, in transcript form, to the SS. The specifics of the incident made it impossible for the European Intelligence Division of the U.S. Army to cast Kurt Debus as an apolitical scientist trying to survive in a fascist world. Debus had gone out of his way to have a colleague arrested by the Gestapo. Craemer was subsequently prosecuted for treason. According to the report, and as a result of Debus’s actions, on November 30, 1942, “Craemer was called to Gestapo H.Q. and confronted with this damning evidence.” The army intelligence officer assigned to the case, Captain F. C. Groves, explained what happened next. On April 5, 1942, “he [Craemer] was dragged before a ‘Sondergericht’ [a special Nazi court] and sentenced to 2 years imprisonment.” Groves’s lengthy summary and analysis of the incident was sent to the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Debus’s “deliberate and vicious denunciation [of] Craemer” was not something army intelligence could disavow, wrote Groves. It was a matter of public record in Germany. An OMGUS report put von Braun on equally shaky footing, and army intelligence cautioned that, given his international profile, pushing the State Department for a visa for von Braun could cause problems. The report revealed that not only had von Braun been an SS officer with the high rank of SS-Sturmbannführer, or SS-Major, but his membership had been sponsored by Heinrich Himmler. In response, JIOA director Colonel Ford proposed contrary action to what was being advised. Ford believed that the best solution was to get these undesirables on an even faster track toward citizenship. If Klaus signed the waiver, JIOA could expedite the process.

With Klaus refusing to sign the documents, the situation escalated into a standoff. Klaus left the meeting and did some investigative work on his own. In the months that followed, he learned what had transpired with Georg Rickhey at Wright Field—that Rickhey had been returned to Germany to stand trial for alleged war crimes. The information had purposely been withheld from the State Department. In a memo to the undersecretary of state, Klaus defended his opposition to the JIOA’s bullish requests to have him sign a blind waiver. “That the department’s security fears were not baseless was recently demonstrated when a war criminal, wanted for war crimes of a bestial kind, was found here among these scientists, to be returned to Germany.” Klaus was determined to hold his ground, but so was the JIOA. The difficulty for Klaus was that he was outnumbered. The same month that the standoff between the State Department and the JIOA began, the Chemical Corps finally imported its first German scientist, an expert in tabun nerve agent synthesis named Dr. Friedrich “Fritz” Hoffmann. The U.S. Army had been interested in stockpiling tabun ever since it obtained its first sample from the Robbers’ Lair, in the British zone in Germany, in May of 1945. The man in charge of the tabun nerve agent program for the Chemical Corps was Colonel Charles E. Loucks, commander of the Army Chemical Center at Edgewood Arsenal, in Maryland. The fifty-one-year-old Colonel Loucks had dedicated his life to chemical warfare. Born and raised in California, Charles E. Loucks received a Bachelor of Arts degree from Stanford University and first became fascinated by war gas while serving in World War I. During his assignment with the first Gas Regiment at Edgewood Arsenal, in 1922, his life’s path seemed to have been set. While Loucks distinguished himself as an expert rifleman, competing in National Rifle and Pistol matches and winning awards, chemical weapons fascinated him the most. He went back to school, to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, to study chemical engineering, and in 1929 he received a Master of Science degree. By 1935 Loucks was the technical director of Chemical Warfare Service, Research and Development, at Edgewood. He had served as an officer with chemical weapons ever since. Major Loucks spent the first year of World War II refining the U.S. military’s standard-issue gas mask. He even worked with Walt Disney and the Sun Rubber Company to transform the spooky, apocalyptic-looking face protector into a more kid-friendly version with a Mickey Mouse face.

He even worked with Walt Disney and the Sun Rubber Company to transform the spooky, apocalyptic-looking face protector into a more kid-friendly version with a Mickey Mouse face. In August 1942, Loucks was made commander of the Rocky Mountain Arsenal, outside Denver, Colorado, where he was in charge of planning, building, and operating the largest-capacity toxic manufacturing plant in the United States. Rocky Mountain produced mustard gas and incendiary bombs on an industrial scale—incendiary bombs that were dropped on Germany and Japan. Loucks was awarded the Legion of Merit for his war service. During the war the U.S. Army had more than four hundred battalions ready for chemical combat. If chemical warfare broke out, the army expected it would involve mustard gas. Sixty thousand soldiers trained in chemical warfare were sent into battle with gas masks and protective suits, carrying a small card that explained what to do in the event of a chemical attack. Fortunately, World War II ended without the use of chemical weapons, but experts like Charles Loucks were caught off guard when they learned just how outperformed America’s chemists had been by Hitler’s. With the discovery that the Nazis had mass-produced previously unknown agents like tabun and sarin gas came the realization that if Germany had initiated chemical warfare it would have been a grossly uneven match. Since war’s end, the army’s Chemical Corps had received 530 tons of tabun, courtesy of the British, who had seized the Reich’s colossal cache from the Robbers’ Lair. But the Chemical Corps had yet to produce much tabun on its own, which is why Dr. Fritz Hoffmann had been brought to America under Operation Paperclip. Hoffmann arrived in February 1947 and immediately got to work synthesizing tabun. Nerve agents were Hoffmann’s area of expertise; he had synthesized poison gas at the Luftwaffe’s Technical Academy, Berlin-Gatow, and also at the chemical warfare laboratories at the University of Würzburg during the war. Fritz Hoffmann was a gigantic man, six foot four, with dark eyes, sharp, angular features, and high cheekbones. He kept his hair combed back behind the ears, perhaps with the help of hair oil. Hoffmann was a gifted organic chemist and a contemplative man who also had a PhD in philosophy. He had suffered from polio as a child. According to the State Department, he was one of the minority of individuals recruited into Operation Paperclip who had been anti-Nazi during the war. When Hoffmann was captured at war’s end he carried with him an unusual document, an affidavit from the U.S. Embassy in Zurich, Switzerland, signed by American Consul General Sam E. Woods. “The bearer", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:Operation Paperclip_cleaned.txt:203:5da46960f14d", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 6116, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "Operation Paperclip_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/031622104X", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "Operation Paperclip_cleaned", "chunk_index": 204, "text": "a gifted organic chemist and a contemplative man who also had a PhD in philosophy.

Woods. “The bearer of this document… Dr. Frederick Wilhelm Hoffmann [was] anti-Nazi during the whole war,” the document stated. It further explained that Hoffmann’s father-in-law, the German economist Dr. Erwin Respondek, had risked life and limb to work as a spy for the Americans during the war. Respondek “rendered extremely valuable services to the Allied war effort,” wrote Consul General Woods. “These services, which are known to the former Secretary of State, the Honorable Cordell After being interrogated by army intelligence in Germany, Hoffmann was found “fit for exploitation for the Office of the Military Government, United States.” He was sent to the Army Chemical Center in Berlin, where he started working for the Chemical Warfare Service until his Operation Paperclip contract was finalized. When Friedrich Hoffmann arrived at Edgewood Arsenal in February 1947, America’s premier chemical weapons research and development facility had been producing war gases for thirty years. The three-thousand-acre peninsula, thick with field and forest, was located twenty miles northeast of Baltimore, Maryland, on the Chesapeake Bay. Because Fritz Hoffmann was the first German at Edgewood thus far, he was quartered inside a barracks with American soldiers. The Top Secret research and development division he had been assigned to was called the Technical Command, and it was there that he began work “synthesizing new insecticides, rodenticides and miticides,” which meant tabun. Colonel Loucks had been ordered by the Chemical Corps to determine how to produce tabun on an industrial scale under a classified program code-named AI.13. Army intelligence believed the Soviets’ chemical weapons program to be considerably ahead of its own, and the Chemical Corps w a s under pressure to catch up. The Soviets had captured the entire IG Farben laboratory at Dyhernfurth and had since reassembled it outside Stalingrad, in the town of Beketovka, under the codename Chemical Works No. 91. In addition to having the laboratory and the science, the Soviets had also captured some of the Farben chemists who had worked at Dyhernfurth. Through their own version of Operation Paperclip, a parallel exploitation program called Operation Osoaviakhim, the Soviets captured German chemist Dr. von Bock and members of his team. The group was taken to Chemical Works No. 91, where von Bock, an expert in air filtration systems, decontamination systems, and hermetically sealed production compartments, was put to work.

Von Bock’s esoteric knowledge gave the Soviets access to critical technical aspects of producing tabun. The hope was that Fritz Hoffmann could bring the Americans up to speed at Edgewood. Indeed, Fritz Hoffmann proved to be a great asset for the classified program. Within months of his arrival at Edgewood he was delivering “work of a high order” and had “shown considerable ingenuity and excellent knowledge,” according to a declassified internal review of his performance. Tabun work progressed. When military intelligence learned that the Soviets’ Chemical Works No. 91 was also producing sarin, Edgewood was told to continue working on tabun but also to redouble efforts in sarin production, with a plan to start producing it on an industrial scale as soon as possible. Project AI.13 was given even higher priority and a new code name, Project AI.13-2.1. In Germany, Nazi scientists with knowledge of tabun and sarin were now being even more aggressively sought for recruitment into Operation Paperclip. Declassified documents reveal that the Chemical Corps wanted to employ Otto Ambros, but he was not available. Ambros was incarcerated inside the prison complex at Nuremberg, awaiting a war crimes trial. Imprisoned alongside Ambros were fellow Farben board members Fritz Ter Meer and Karl Krauch as well as Hermann Schmitz, Farben’s powerful CEO and the man who kept the Auschwitz scrapbook hidden in a secret wall safe. SS-Brigadeführer Dr. Walter Schieber, Ambros’s liaison to the Speer ministry and the man who oversaw the work at Dyhernfurth, was also high on the Paperclip target list, but recruitment of Schieber would have to wait. Schieber was also being held at Nuremberg. The IG Farben trial, officially called United States of America v. Carl Krauch et al., was scheduled to begin in a few months, in the summer of 1947. Time would tell who, if any, of Hitler’s chemists would become available. It had been a little over four months since the New York Times had broken the story of Operation Paperclip, and the negative attention to the program had not subsided. Then, on March 9, 1947, journalist Drew Pearson reported the most outrageous news story about Operation Paperclip to date. According to Pearson, the U.S. Army had offered Farben executive Karl Krauch a Paperclip contract while he was incarcerated at Nuremberg.

Krauch was the lead defendant in the upcoming war crimes trial. He had served as Göring’s plenipotentiary for chemical production and had advocated for the use of nerve agents against the Allies. Krauch was the man who galvanized his fellow German industrialists to mobilize resources to help the Nazis go to war. Drew Pearson’s column, “Washington Merry-Go-Round,” was widely read and highly influential, and the report about Krauch caused such a scandal that General Eisenhower, the U.S. Army chief of staff, demanded to know what was going on with Operation Paperclip. The man who briefed Eisenhower was chief of military intelligence Stephen J. Chamberlin. After what was reported to be a twenty-minute meeting, General Eisenhower remained in support of the Paperclip program. For the military chiefs inside the JIOA, the problems with the public’s perception of Paperclip were almost universally blamed on the State Department. Dean Rusk, who worked in the office of the assistant secretary of war, summed up JIOA’s attitude toward the State Department in a memorandum the day after the Eisenhower briefing. “The public relations people are feeling mounting pressure on the German scientist business.… Our position is inherently weak because the State Department finds this whole program difficult to support.” The JIOA decided it was time to get rid of Samuel Klaus. Director Thomas Ford wrote General Stephen Chamberlin saying that Klaus was “obnoxiously difficult” and needed to be removed. Within the week, Klaus was transferred from the visa section of the State Department to the Office of the Legal Adviser. He no longer had any say over the policies and procedures regarding Operation Paperclip. It remains a mystery if Klaus had anything to do with the public’s perception of the program, but in years to come, and as McCarthyism expanded, Klaus would be accused of having leaked negative stories about the German scientist program to the press. But even with Klaus banished from the program, for the first time since Paperclip’s inception in the spring of 1945, the entire operation was now in danger of collapse. Assistant Secretary of War Howard Petersen worried with colleagues that the War Department would be buried in scandals involving Nazi scientists. Petersen predicted that the whole program would be shut down in a matter of months. Instead the opposite happened. With the signing of the National Security Act by President Truman, on July 26, 1947, America’s armed services and intelligence agencies were restructured.

The War Department was reconstituted into the Department of Defense, the State-War-Navy Coordinating Committee became the National Security Council, and the Central Intelligence Agency was born. A new age was dawning for the controversial Paperclip program. On the one hand, it struggled to hold up a false face of scientific prowess behind which lay a tawdry group of amoral war opportunists, many of whom were linked to war crimes. But just as von Braun admitted to New Yorker writer Daniel Lang that what he really cared most about was seeing “how the golden cow could be milked most successfully,” the newly created CIA saw the Paperclip scientists in similar quid pro quo terms. There was advantage to be had in using men who had everything to lose and were, at the same time, uniquely focused on personal gain. Sometime in the spring of 1947, scientists at Edgewood Arsenal began conducting human experiments with tabun nerve agent. All soldiers used in these experiments were so-called volunteers, but the men were not made privy to the fact that they were being subjected to low-level concentrations of tabun. Some of the tests took place in Utah, at the Dugway Proving Ground. Other tests took place inside Edgewood’s “gassing chamber for human tests,” a 9 x 9-foot tile-and-brick cube with an airtight metal door. One of the people observing the tabun tests was Dr. L. Wilson Greene, technical director of the Chemical and Radiological Laboratories at the Army Chemical Center at Edgewood and a close collaborator of Fritz Hoffmann’s. Greene was a short man with a square jaw and a barrel chest. What he lacked in height he made up for in vision. While observing the behavior of the soldiers in the tabun gas experiments, L. Wilson Greene had a revelation. Greene noticed that, after soldiers were put in the “gassing chamber,” they became “partially disabled for from one to three weeks with fatigue, lassitude, complete loss of initiative and interest, and apathy.” What struck Greene most was that the men were wholly incapacitated for a period of time but not permanently injured. The men recovered entirely on their own; the antidote was time. Dr. L. Wilson Greene saw in this a new kind of warfare. He sat down and began outlining his idea for America’s war-fighting future in an opus that would become known as “Psychochemical Warfare: A New Concept of War.” In the monograph, Greene wrote, “The trend of each major conflict, being characterized by increased death, human misery, and property destruction, could be reversed.” His seminal vision for psychochemical warfare—a term he coined—was to incapacitate", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:Operation Paperclip_cleaned.txt:207:1dda67e0940e", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 6120, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "Operation Paperclip_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/031622104X", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "Operation Paperclip_cleaned", "chunk_index": 208, "text": "their own; the antidote was time.

Greene believed that in this way the face of warfare could change from barbaric to human. Incapacitating agents were “gentle” weapons; they knocked a man out without permanent injury. With psychochemical warfare, Greene explained, America could conquer its enemies “without the wholesale killing of people or the mass destruction of property.” Greene was not proposing to use low levels of tabun gas on the battlefield. He was talking about using other kinds of incapacitating agents, drugs that could immobilize or temporarily paralyze a person, “hallucinogenic or psychotomimetic drugs… whose effects mimic insanity or psychosis.” “There can be no doubt that their will to resist would be weakened greatly, if not entirely destroyed, by the mass hysteria and panic which would ensue,” Greene explained. Greene proposed that an immediate “search be made for a stable chemical compound which would cause mental abnormalities of military significance.” He sought drugs that made people irrational. In his monograph, Greene provided the army with a list of ^( ∘ 𝔠)61 materials known to cause mental disorders.” These sixty-one compounds, he said, should be studied and refined to determine which single compound would be the best possible incapacitating agents for U.S. military use. Greene requested a budget of fifty thousand dollars, roughly half a million dollars in 2013, which was granted. Research began. Greene assigned his colleague and friend Fritz Hoffmann the job of researching a multitude of toxins for potential military use. Fritz Hoffmann was by now recognized at Edgewood as one of the most gifted organic chemists in the Chemical Corps. If anyone could find and prepare the ideal incapacitating agent for the battlefield, Hoffmann could. He began a broad spectrum of research on everything from well-known street drugs to highly obscure toxins from the third world. There was mescaline, obtained from the peyote cactus and used by Native American Indians, with side effects ranging from divination to boredom. He studied fly agaric, a hallucinogenic mushroom found on the barren slopes of Mongolia and rumored to facilitate contact with the spirit world, and piruri, a toxic vegetable leaf from Australia, used by Aborigines, that was found to suppress thirst. Yaxee and epena, from Venezuela, Colombia, and Brazil, caused people to see things that weren’t really there.

It was a drug that for centuries had been “used by primitive tribes to escape the realities of their plight by using hallucinogenic properties.” Soon Hoffmann would travel the world in search of these incapacitating agents on behalf of the Chemical Corps. Dr. Greene’s idea of psychochemical warfare would have a profound effect on the future of the U.S. Army’s Chemical Corps, but it would also greatly affect the direction of the newest civilian intelligence organization in Washington, the CIA. The Agency had deep pockets and big ideas. For the CIA, using drugs to incapacitate individuals had many more applications than just on the battlefield, and the Agency began developing programs of its own. Fritz Hoffmann and L. Wilson Greene were at the locus of a growing partnership being forged between the Chemical Corps and the CIA. Soon, biological warfare experts from Camp Detrick would also be brought into the fold. This particular biological weapons program, which would be run by a group called Special Operations Division, or SO Division, was fueled by Operation Paperclip and would develop into one of the most controversial and collaborative efforts in the history of the CIA. It had been a year and a half since the Merck Report on the biological weapons threat had been released, and an influx of congressional funding had transformed Camp Detrick into a state-of-the-art bioweapons research and development facility. The army purchased 545 acres of land adjacent to what had been called “Area A” and created a new area, designated “Area B,” where some of Detrick’s first postwar field tests with crop dusters and spray hoses would occur. During the war, dangerous pathogens like anthrax and “X” had been tested and cultured inside Detrick’s germ lab, a rudimentary wooden building covered in black tarpaper and nicknamed the Black Maria by scientists. During the war, an industrial-size boiler, used for fermenting, sat on the lawn outside the germ lab. Now, given the scope of work planned for the immediate future, Detrick needed an aerosol chamber that was bigger and better than anything else like it in the world. The job of designing such a structure was assigned to a bacteriologist named Dr. Harold Batchelor. Detrick’s British counterparts, at Porton Down, had an excellent chamber of their own, but it fit only two or three mice. What Batchelor came up with was a monstrous spherical one-million-liter chamber called the Eight Ball, shaped like a giant’s golf ball and held upright by iron “legs.” The Chicago Bridge", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:Operation Paperclip_cleaned.txt:209:702d2acb0aab", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 6122, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "Operation Paperclip_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/031622104X", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "Operation Paperclip_cleaned", "chunk_index": 210, "text": "that was bigger and better than anything else like it in the world.

What Batchelor came up with was a monstrous spherical one-million-liter chamber called the Eight Ball, shaped like a giant’s golf ball and held upright by iron “legs.” The Chicago Bridge and Iron Works was commissioned to build the Eight Ball to specifications that made it airtight and bombproof. The Eight Ball was to have portholes, doors, and hatchways and steel walls of one and a half inches. Inside the Eight Ball, airflow would simulate weather systems, with scientists on the outside controlling temperatures on the inside within a range of 55 to 90 degrees Fahrenheit. Humidity could be controlled inside the Eight Ball to fluctuate between 30 and 100 percent. This state-of-the-art environmental control would allow Detrick’s scientists to understand how aerosolized biological agents would work at different altitudes in the open air. The sphere would weigh more than 131 tons and would stand four stories tall. A catwalk around its center would allow scientists to observe, through portholes, the test subjects sitting inside as they were exposed to the world’s deadliest germs. The Chicago Bridge and Iron Works agreed to a delivery date of 1949. With the chamber’s design complete, Dr. Batchelor prepared to travel to Germany. There was an important German scientist who was just now becoming available for an interview. This was a man who knew more than almost anyone else in the world about biological weapons. He was particularly knowledgeable about weaponized bubonic plague. A meeting was arranged for November 10, 1947, between Blome and Batchelor. Present alongside Dr. Batchelor were Detrick doctors Dr. Charles R. Phillips, a specialist in desterilization, Dr. Donald W. Falconer, an explosives expert, and Dr. A. W. Gorelick, a dosage expert. Lieutenant R. W. Swanson represented the U.S. Navy and Lieutenant Colonel Warren S. LeRoy represented the army’s European Command Headquarters. An interpreter and a stenographer were also present. Dr. Blome was told in advance that everything discussed would be classified. Dr. Batchelor spoke first, setting the tone for the all-day affair. “We have come to interview Dr. Blome personally as well as professionally,” Batchelor said. “We have friends in Germany, scientific friends, and this is an opportunity for us to enjoy meeting [Dr. Blome] and to discuss our various problems with him.” To begin, Batchelor asked, “Would it be possible for Dr. Blome to give us an overall picture of the information that he has? The nature of the world under discussion?” Blome spoke in English, pausing on occasion for the interpreter to help him with a word. “In 1943 I received orders from Goering for all the research of", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:Operation Paperclip_cleaned.txt:210:3bfd658f9f08", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 6123, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "Operation Paperclip_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/031622104X", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "Operation Paperclip_cleaned", "chunk_index": 211, "text": "scientific friends, and this is an opportunity for us to enjoy meeting [Dr. Blome] and to discuss our various problems with him.” To begin, Batchelor asked, “Would it be possible for Dr. Blome to give us an overall picture of the information that he has? The nature of the world under discussion?” Blome spoke in English, pausing on occasion for the interpreter to help him with a word. “In 1943 I received orders from Goering for all the research of Biological Warfare,” Blome explained, “all the research for BW [would fall] under the name Kanserreseach.… Cancer Research had already started long before that, and I was already working all the time but in order to keep this development secret [the Reich] disguised it.” Dr. Blome laid out the command structure of those involved in biological weapons work under Himmler, and where the men were now. It was a surprisingly small group of “around twenty” men. As head of the Reich Research Council, Blome explained, Göring was at the top, as the Reich’s dictator of science. There were three men in equal positions directly under Göring, Dr. Blome explained. Blome was in charge of all research and development of pathogens. Doctors and scientists working in this area reported to him. Major General Dr. Walter Schreiber—the Russians’ surprise witness at Nuremberg and the man who had pointed the finger at Blome—was in charge of vaccines, antidotes, and serums for biological weapons. All doctors and scientists working in these areas ultimately reported to Schreiber. Finally, Blome explained, Field Marshal Wilhelm Keitel oversaw the Lightning Rod Committee, Blitzableiter, the code name for the ordnance experts who worked on delivery systems for biological bombs. Anyone conducting tests with these kinds of weapons had to go through Keitel. Göring had committed suicide and Keitel had been hanged at Nuremberg after the trial of the major war criminals. Major General Walter Schreiber was working for the Russians now. It appeared that Dr. Blome was the last available man standing with extensive inside knowledge of the Third Reich’s bioweapons program. Blome spoke of the Reich’s outpost on the island of Riems, a facility that specialized in “Sickness of Cattle” research, including rinderpest and foot-and-mouth disease. Blome said that because “the isle was completely isolated except by wire,” it was a perfect place to conduct this kind of dangerous research. The scientist in charge of the laboratory was Professor Otto Waldmann and his assistant was Erich Traub “of international fame.” Blome was referring to the fact that before the war, Traub spent several years in America doing research at the Rockefeller Institute, in New Jersey. Rinderpest was a terrible disease, Blome said. In many ways it was the biological weapon he feared most. “Germany depended on milk and butter for 60% of her fat resources,” said Blome. “In 1944 it would have resulted in a great catastrophe if foot-and-mouth", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:Operation Paperclip_cleaned.txt:211:d7cfde6a50f7", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 6124, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "Operation Paperclip_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/031622104X", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "Operation Paperclip_cleaned", "chunk_index": 212, "text": "Otto Waldmann and his assistant was Erich Traub “of international fame.” Blome was referring to the fact that before the war, Traub spent several years in America doing research at the Rockefeller Institute, in New Jersey.

In many ways it was the biological weapon he feared most. “Germany depended on milk and butter for 60% of her fat resources,” said Blome. “In 1944 it would have resulted in a great catastrophe if foot-and-mouth disease had been used against Germany. It would have been the greatest catastrophe ever faced,” according to Blome, “[i]f a country relies on all its fat resources to get milk and butter. Once the disease starts there is no stopping it.” The Detrick scientists were very interested to learn more. How did the Reich acquire and develop the pathogen, Batchelor asked? Blome had already explained this to the Operation Alsos interrogators, but that was two years ago, before the doctors’ trial, and apparently these Detrick scientists were not familiar with what Blome had said when he was at Dustbin. “By international law it was prohibited to have the virus for this sickness in Europe,” Blome said. “The virus was in Turkey and Himmler ordered that for the Isle.” Blome confirmed that Dr. Erich Traub went to Turkey on direct orders from Himmler and acquired a strain of the dangerous virus there. At Riems, Traub then succeeded in producing a dry form of the virus. Dry forms were the deadliest of all, said Blome. “After a period of seven months based on experimentation on the Isle, this virus was still effective. After seven months they still spread and the cattle were all infected.” Dr. Blome had been acquitted of war crimes charges five weeks earlier. Seven of his codefendants were to be hanged. Clearly, the subject of experiments on humans was not something he was going to discuss. The question was rephrased: What did Blome believe was the most groundbreaking biological weapons work conducted by the Reich? Blome said that at Posen, he had been working at dispersing biological agents in a “combination with gas that [a]ffects the throat. When membranes are hurt [that is, damaged]… bacteria have a better chance to infect,” Blome said. Blome was no fool. “Professor Kliewe has not worked himself with experiments,” Blome said. Heinrich Kliewe performed intelligence work. He was in charge of keeping tabs on the biological weapons programs being pursued by nations at war with the Reich. “Kliewe investigated Polish and Russian sabotage,” Blome said. “The activity here was not to cause an epidemic amongst the population, merely to kill certain people.” During the war, Polish resistance fighters in Posen had succeeded in assassinating “about twenty people,” Blome said, most of whom were SS officers. “A lot of cases of Typhoid,” said Blome. “The waiters in restaurants took fountain pens filled with the", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:Operation Paperclip_cleaned.txt:212:9fbc9d92ef1f", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 6125, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "Operation Paperclip_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/031622104X", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "Operation Paperclip_cleaned", "chunk_index": 213, "text": "on the biological weapons programs being pursued by nations at war with the Reich. “Kliewe investigated Polish and Russian sabotage,” Blome said. “The activity here was not to cause an epidemic amongst the population, merely to kill certain people.” During the war, Polish resistance fighters in Posen had succeeded in assassinating “about twenty people,” Blome said, most of whom were SS officers. “A lot of cases of Typhoid,” said Blome. “The waiters in restaurants took fountain pens filled with the inoculum and injected the inoculum into the soup or the food on their way to and from the dining room. This has been proved. Polish resistance movement was heading all these activities. A German-Polish woman doctor was working in the hospital and got hold of the bacteria and forwarded it to the other people.” Blome explained that there was an extensive and well-funded Reich research program going on in the field of vaccines, antidotes, and serums—against many pathogens and diseases, from cholera to parrot virus to plague. But Blome explained that the holy grail of biological weapons research was the plague. “I believe the only thing of danger to Germany would have been the plague. Because for propaganda reasons the plague got more attention tha[n] any others,” Blome added. “People all over the world believe it is the worst sickness there is.” “Schreiber, as the head of the department [epidemics] had very good vaccine material on hand for typhoid, paratyphoid, cholera, diphtheria and Ruhr,” Blome explained. “For the plague, they had serum on hand but the serum was not very powerful, it was very weak. They did not have any vaccine so I started to build an institute which has never been completed.” On occasion, Blome said, he worked in concert with Schreiber’s vaccine research laboratory to provide them with “good vaccine material,” meaning the germs. “Was he under Kliewe?” Dr. Phillips asked, apparently still unaware that Professor Schreiber was the same Dr. Schreiber who had testified at Nuremberg. If, at Nuremberg, the Russians meant to send a message to American biological weapons makers with Schreiber’s testimony, this had gone over the head of these bacteriologists from Camp Detrick. Blome repeated that Schreiber was “in the same position as I would be under Göring for my cancer researches, so this man was [directly] under Göring.” Meaning Blome and Schreiber were equals in the Reich’s chain of command. They were also archenemies. “Schreiber is a Russian PW [prisoner of war] and everybody who knew Schreiber is convinced he is working for them,” said Blome. In this world of intense suspicion, of deviance and trickery, it was impossible to know who was lying and who was telling the truth. The time came to have a meal. “In closing this particular angle we express our gratitude to Dr. Blome for his wholehearted cooperation,” Dr. Batchelor said.

The time came to have a meal. “In closing this particular angle we express our gratitude to Dr. Blome for his wholehearted cooperation,” Dr. Batchelor said. He suggested that they all have dinner together. Pleasant talk. “During that time we will not discuss this matter,” Batchelor said. As if the Americans had not just tried to hang Dr. Blome for war crimes. As if Blome had not been a hard- core Nazi ideologue and member of the inner circle, or had not worn the Golden Party Badge. Pleasantries were exchanged and the meeting was adjourned. After the meeting, the Detrick doctors requested from the Army Chemical Corps everything they knew about Dr. Erich Traub. That Dr. Blome said he was most afraid of an outbreak of cattle plague was serious news. Traub was the world’s leading expert in the disease. Now the U.S. Army wanted him as their own. Dr. Traub was a virologist, microbiologist, and professor and a doctor of veterinary medicine. He had been the second in command at the Reich’s State Research Institute at Riems since 1942. He was also an expert in Newcastle disease, a contagious bird flu, that he was rumored to have weaponized. The Chemical Corps knew Traub spoke fluent English, that he had dark brown hair, gray-brown eyes, and two pronounced saber scars on his face—on the forehead and upper lip. And they knew that from 1932 until 1938, Traub had been a staff member at the Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research, in New Jersey. But after meeting with Dr. Blome, the Chemical Corps wanted more information on Traub, and they tracked down two of his former American colleagues for interviews. One of them, Dr. Little, described Traub as a “domineering German and a surly type individual with a violent temper.” Another colleague, Dr. John Nelson, found that despite “long training in the care of animals, [Traub] went out of his way to be cruel to animals.” This troubled Nelson, who felt that “any person who is cruel to animals shows little distinction and difference to his treatment of his fellow human beings.” Before the war, Traub was given the opportunity to stay in America and continue his research fulltime. He chose to return to Germany, citing loyalty to the Reich. In 1939, Traub was drafted into the Wehrmacht, Veterinary Corps, and in 1940, he was elevated to captain and fought in the campaign against France. He was a member of several Nazi organizations, including the Nationalsozialistisches Kraftfahrerkorps (NSKK), or National Socialist Motor Corps; the National Socialist People’s Welfare (NSV); and the Reichsluftschutzbund (RLB), or State", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:Operation Paperclip_cleaned.txt:214:605a9f60883b", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 6127, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "Operation Paperclip_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/031622104X", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "Operation Paperclip_cleaned", "chunk_index": 215, "text": "Traub was given the opportunity to stay in America and continue his research fulltime.

He was a member of several Nazi organizations, including the Nationalsozialistisches Kraftfahrerkorps (NSKK), or National Socialist Motor Corps; the National Socialist People’s Welfare (NSV); and the Reichsluftschutzbund (RLB), or State Air Protection Corps. Dr. Traub’s talents as a virologist had been identified, and he had been pulled back from the front lines and assigned to biological weapons work. According to Blome, Traub was the most talented scientist working on anti-animal research—biological weapons designed to kill the animals that a nation relies upon most for food. At the end of the war, when the Riems lab fell to the Russians, with it went Dr. Traub, his wife, Blanka, and their three children. The laboratory was renamed the Land Office II for Animal Epidemic Diseases and the Soviets put Traub back to work on bioweapons research. Now, in 1947, the Army began a plan to lure Traub away. As for Dr. Blome, the scientists from Detrick knew it was far too risky to offer him a Paperclip contract just weeks after he’d been acquitted of capital war crimes at Nuremberg. Drew Pearson’s reporting on the Paperclip contract offered to Karl Krauch in prison had upset General Eisenhower and nearly brought the program to its knees. While Blome made clear his willingness to work for the Army, the Detrick scientists knew he would have to remain an under-the-radar consultant, relegated to the JIOA target list for potential hire at a future date. The army bacteriologist and biological weapons expert Dr. Harold Batchelor returned to Camp Detrick with many new ideas to explore, including assassination-by-poison techniques that had been shared with him by Dr. Blome. The Reich had been researching biological weapons that would initiate epidemics but could also “kill certain people,” according to Blome. In 1947, however, with scientific frontiers opening up wide, there would be hundreds of new ways to assassinate individuals using a single device carrying a biological or chemical agent. This was an area in which the CIA was interested. The Chemical Corps had the perfect scientist for the job of exploring poisons that could be used for individual assassinations, Fritz Hoffmann. But Hoffmann had a backlog of work. He still had to figure out how to synthesize tabun gas so the Chemical Corps could hurry up and begin producing it on an industrial scale. In June 1948, Colonel Charles E. Loucks, the man who oversaw the Paperclip scientists at Edgewood, was made brigadier general and transferred to Heidelberg. Loucks now served as chief of intelligence collection for Chemical Warfare Plans, European Command.

In June 1948, Colonel Charles E. Loucks, the man who oversaw the Paperclip scientists at Edgewood, was made brigadier general and transferred to Heidelberg. Loucks now served as chief of intelligence collection for Chemical Warfare Plans, European Command. In Heidelberg, he had access to a whole new group of Hitler’s former chemists, from those who had been at the top of the chain of command on down. Within weeks of his arrival, Loucks formed a working relationship with Richard Kuhn, the former director of the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Medical Research in Heidelberg. Because Kuhn had an international profile before and during the war, he was a problematic candidate for Operation Paperclip. Though Kuhn had once been revered among scientists, Samuel Goudsmit of Operation Alsos was never afraid to remind colleagues that Kuhn had become an active Nazi during the war, and that he began his lectures with “Sieg Heil” and the Nazi salute. Kuhn had lied to Goudsmit in a postwar interview, swearing that he had never worked on Reich projects during the war. In fact Kuhn was a chemical weapons expert for the Reich and developed soman nerve agent. Soman was even deadlier than sarin and tabun but considered too delicate and therefore too costly to industrialize. Richard Kuhn began working with General Loucks in Heidelberg on chemical weapons projects for the Chemical Corps. General Loucks’s friendly relationship with Richard Kuhn drew ire from the British. When formally queried about his professional partnership with Kuhn, Loucks replied, “I was under the impression that Professor Kuhn had been cleared of his Nazi complicity or had suffered the penalty and is now in the good graces of both the British and the Americans.” Further, wrote Loucks, “I am sure our people are certainly familiar with his background.” To General Loucks, moving forward on military programs considered vital to U.S. national security was more important than dredging up an individual’s Nazi past. Through the lens of history, this remains one of the most complicated issues regarding Operation Paperclip. When working with ardent Nazis, some American handlers appear to have developed an ability to look the other way. Others, like General Loucks, looked straight at the man and saw only the scientist, not the Nazi. Richard Kuhn had a connection with a scientist in Switzerland with whom General Loucks was particularly interested in working. The scientist had been investigating a little-known incapacitating agent that was far more potent than anything the Chemical Corps was working on at the time. This Swiss chemist had recently given a lecture, “New Hallucinatory Agent,” to a gathering of the Swiss Society of Psychiatry and the Association of Physicians in Zurich.

This Swiss chemist had recently given a lecture, “New Hallucinatory Agent,” to a gathering of the Swiss Society of Psychiatry and the Association of Physicians in Zurich. On December 16, 1948, General Loucks took a trip to Switzerland. So as not to draw attention to himself or the U.S. military, he took the unusual step of taking off his military uniform. This story does not appear in any known declassified army record but is told in Loucks’s own words, in his personal diaries that were left to the U.S. Army Heritage Center in Pennsylvania. “Went back to the house and put on civilian clothes,” Loucks wrote in his diary. His wife, Pearl, took the plainclothed general to the train station. En route to his destination in Switzerland, Loucks shared a compartment with a “foreigner, dark, nationality unknown,” and a “Dutchman who acted Jewish in quizzing me all about myself.” The train compartment, Loucks noted, provided a clean, comfortable, well-lit ride, and General Loucks arrived in Bern at 8:55 that night. Before heading to bed, Loucks enjoyed a fire in the fireplace in his hotel room. General Loucks did not note in his journal any of the details of the meeting with the mysterious Swiss scientist. The mission was classified. Loucks returned to Germany the following day, and he did note in his journal that Richard Kuhn came over to his house for lunch with a special guest, Dr. Gerhard Schrader, the inventor of Preparation 9/91, or tabun gas. With snow coming down outside the Louckses’ home in flurries, Richard Kuhn, Dr. Gerhard Schrader, and General Loucks had a pleasant chat and “lunch of pork chops.” Decades later, in a speech prepared for the Amherst chapter of the Daughters of the American Revolution and the Sons of the American Revolution, General Loucks revealed that this Swiss chemist referred to him by Richard Kuhn had been Professor Werner Stoll, a psychiatric researcher at the University of Zurich. The hallucinatory agent that Loucks was after in Switzerland would be the ultimate “incapacitation chemical” also sought by L. Wilson Greene at Edgewood “to knock out not kill.” The chemical, said Loucks, was called “Lysergic Acid Diethylamide,” or LSD. Stoll did not discover LSD. That distinction went to Albert Hofmann, a chemist for Sandoz pharmaceutical company in Basel. Werner Stoll, a colleague of Hoffmann’s (and the son of Sandoz chief chemist, Arthur Stoll), repeated Albert Hofmann’s original LSD experiment and concluded, “modified LSD-25 was a psychotropic compound that was nontoxic and could have enormous use as a psychiatric aid.” In 1947, Werner Stoll", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:Operation Paperclip_cleaned.txt:217:6f44bc5ea4b7", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 6130, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "Operation Paperclip_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/031622104X", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "Operation Paperclip_cleaned", "chunk_index": 218, "text": "“to knock out not kill.” The chemical, said Loucks, was called “Lysergic Acid Diethylamide,” or LSD.

Stoll’s second paper, entitled “A New Hallucinatory Agent, Active in Very Small Amounts,” was published two years later, in 1949. But General Loucks did not see LSD as a psychiatric aid but rather as a weapon, an incapacitating agent with enormous potential on the battlefield. Soon the army and the navy would all be experimenting with LSD as a weapon, and the CIA would be experimenting with LSD as a means of controlling human behavior, an endeavor that soon came to be known as mind control. Eventually, physicians and chemists from Operation Paperclip would work on jointly operated classified programs code-named Chatter, Bluebird, Artichoke, MKUltra, and others. LSD, the drug that induces paranoia and unpredictability and makes people see things that are not really there, would become a strange allegory for the Cold War. He left a return telephone number and his name, Schieber. General Loucks had been in Germany since June. As chief of intelligence collection for chemical warfare plans in Europe, it was Loucks’s job to determine which Western European countries were developing chemical weapons and to monitor their progress. Loucks was also working on unfinished business back at Edgewood, namely, the continuing failure by the Chemical Corps to develop industrial-scale production of nerve gas, an effort that by now had officially switched from the pursuit of tabun to the pursuit of sarin. The American university professors Loucks had hired back in the U.S. were making very little progress. “We put samples [of sarin] in front of them and everything, but yet they… could not come up with any process to make some Sarin,” General Loucks explained decades later in an oral history for the U.S. Army. A fire in the sarin plant at Edgewood had set the program back even further. Schieber was a Nazi Bonzen, a big wheel. He was unattractive, fat, and wore a Hitler mustache and false teeth. Since the 1920s he had been regarded as one of Hitler’s Alte Kämpfer, the Old Fighters, trusted members of Hitler’s inner circle who wore the Golden Party Badge. Dr. Schieber was also a loyal SS man and served on the personal staff of Heinrich Himmler. SS-Brigadeführer Dr. Walter Schieber had been a dedicated and loyal member of the Nazi Party since 1931.

He had also been frequently photographed alongside Hitler, Himmler, Bormann, and Speer as part of the inner circle. A number of these photographs survived the war, which made public dealings with Schieber impossible. U.S. Army transactions with him were classified Top Secret. As head of the Reich Ministry of Armaments Supply Office (Rüstungslieferungsamt), first under Fritz Todt when the ministry was called the Munitions Ministry, or Organisation Todt, and then under Albert Speer, Schieber was an engineer and a chemist and handled business in both areas for the Third Reich. As an engineer, he oversaw many of the Reich’s underground engineering projects. “Designs for concentration camp armaments factories remained almost the exclusive work of Schieber,” writes Michael Thad Allen, an expert on the SS and slave labor. Schieber also wore his chemist’s hat for at least one concentration camp experiment. In an attempt to save the SS money and address the growing problem of food shortages among slave laborers, Schieber designed a “nourishment” program called Eastern Nutrition (Östliche Kostform). It was tested at the Mauthausen concentration camp. For a period of six months, starting in December 1943, a group of one hundred and fifty slave laborers were denied the watery broth they usually received and instead were fed an artificial paste designed by Schieber and made up of cellulose remnants, or pieces of used clothing. One hundred and sixteen of the one hundred and fifty test subjects died. After the war, there was a judicial inquiry into Schieber’s Eastern Nutrition program. The West German courts determined that the resulting deaths could not necessarily be “attributed to nutrition” because there were so many other causes of death in the concentration camp. Walter Schieber was further linked to the deaths of hundreds, if not thousands, of slave laborers through the various chemical weapons programs that were carried out at Farben’s multiple production plants. Schieber was not tried at Nuremberg but was used as a witness for the prosecution instead. During the war, with his expertise as a chemist, SS-Brigadeführer Dr. Walter Schieber was the Speer ministry’s liaison to IG Farben and he oversaw the industrial production of tabun and sarin gas. According to his intelligence file, one of his titles was “confidential clerk of IG Farben AG.” Dr. Walter Schieber and Dr. Otto Ambros worked together at the Dyhernfurth nerve agent production facility.

By the late summer of 1948, Otto Ambros had been tried and convicted at Nuremberg and was serving an eight-year sentence at Landsberg Prison for mass murder and slavery. Schieber had been released from his obligations as a witness for the tribunal and was a free man. Now, here he was on the telephone, requesting to speak with Brigadier General Loucks. Schieber was looking for work with the U.S. Army Chemical Corps. Four months prior, in February 1948, former SS-Brigadeführer Walter Schieber had signed a Top Secret Operation Paperclip contract with the JIOA. He had been recruited by Colonel Putt at Wright Field, now Wright-Patterson Air Force Base. Putt wanted to make use of Schieber’s underground engineering skills—just as Georg Rickhey’s skills had been used before Rickhey was returned to Germany to stand trial for war crimes. Hiring a top Nazi like Walter Schieber was risky, and the potential problems facing the U.S. Air Force for doing so were candidly discussed in an exchange of memorandums. A JIOA case officer wrote to military headquarters in Frankfurt summarizing how things were progressing. “Subject is Dr. Walter Schieber … requested priority shipment to Wright Field. Schieber’s ability is outstanding and his potentialities believed invaluable to the United States.” For the past three months, the case officer explained, Schieber had been working on “the underground factory project,” a massive undertaking, at U.S. military headquarters in Germany. The project was spearheaded by Franz Dorsch, and Schieber had been working as Dorsch’s first assistant. In Germany, Schieber and Dorsch had supervised “150 scientists and technicians” who had built underground factories for the Reich. The result was a thousand-page monograph for U.S. Air Force. Schieber, the report explained, “has been especially cooperative and is agreeable to going to [the] United States. He is well known to the Soviets and is desired by them. His exploitation in the United States is therefore believed highly desirable.” There was, however, a problem that needed to be addressed, wrote the case officer. “His party record is as follows: Entered party in June 31, Brigade Fuhrer in the SS, holder of the Golden Party Badge, member of SS, DAF [Deutsche Arbeitsfront, or German Labor Front], NSV [Nationalsozialistische Volkswohlfahrt, or National Socialist People’s Welfare], and VDCH [VDCh, or Association of German Chemists].” There was no way to disguise that Schieber had been in Hitler’s inner circle, but the JIOA also proposed a solution. “In order to minimize the possibility of unfavorable publicity in the United States your views requested on advisability of", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:Operation Paperclip_cleaned.txt:220:6dd4ffaa2767", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 6133, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "Operation Paperclip_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/031622104X", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "Operation Paperclip_cleaned", "chunk_index": 221, "text": "in June 31, Brigade Fuhrer in the SS, holder of the Golden Party Badge, member of SS, DAF [Deutsche Arbeitsfront, or German Labor Front], NSV [Nationalsozialistische Volkswohlfahrt, or National Socialist People’s Welfare], and VDCH [VDCh, or Association of German Chemists].” There was no way to disguise that Schieber had been in Hitler’s inner circle, but the JIOA also proposed a solution. “In order to minimize the possibility of unfavorable publicity in the United States your views requested on advisability of shipping subject via air under escort and or under an alias.” Schieber could be part of Operation Paperclip as long as no one knew who Schieber really was. Unlike standard operating procedure with Operation Paperclip applicants, there was to be no photograph of SS-Brigadeführer Dr. Walter Schieber attached to his intelligence file. The air force agreed with JIOA’s suggestions. “ Ship Dr. Walter Schieber to Wright Field Dayton Ohio. Air Force requests case be expedited and given top priority.” There was one caveat that JIOA and the air force agreed upon. Dr. Schieber had to undergo a denazification trial first. “Trusting he would be placed in Class 3^(∘) —the category for individuals who were “less incriminated”—after his denazification trial, Dr. Walter Schieber packed his bags and awaited transport to the United States. Instead, on March 11, 1948, a different verdict came in: “the civilian Internee Dr. Walter Schieber, born 13-09-1897 at Beimerstetten, former Chief of Armaments Deliveries on the Reich Ministry for Armaments and War Production, Head of the Central Office for Generators, Deputy Head of the Reich Organization Industry, SS-Brigadefueher [sic] , PSt [presently] held at this enclosure,” read the decree, “was tried by the Sonder-Spruchkammer for Hesse, Neustadt-Lager, and sentenced to Group Five days after his trial, Schieber contacted the U.S. Army Counter Intelligence Corps to relay to his Paperclip handler his version of events. “Herr Berbeth [the judge] had subject brought into the chamber and asked him about his trip to the United States, to which Schieber replied that he did not think it would be wise for him to go to the U.S. as an offender. Herr Berbeth suggested that he should immediately apply for a re-trial or ask the Minister for Political Liberation for a pardon. Herr Berbeth also told Schieber that he would recommend such a pardon.” Schieber told his Paperclip handler that, after leaving the courtroom, he had returned to the internee camp where he was being held. Then, according to Schieber, something rather shocking happened: “Berbeth of the court joined Schieber and told him, contrary to his previous statement, not to apply for another trial or a pardon, but to go to Frankfurt immediately, contact the Russian Liaison Officer and ask for an Interzonal Pass. With this pass, subject [Schieber] was to enter the Russian Zone and proceed to one of his factories in the Schwarza/Saale [where] he could be assured of", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:Operation Paperclip_cleaned.txt:221:531d605c99dd", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 6134, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "Operation Paperclip_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/031622104X", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "Operation Paperclip_cleaned", "chunk_index": 222, "text": "where he was being held.

With this pass, subject [Schieber] was to enter the Russian Zone and proceed to one of his factories in the Schwarza/Saale [where] he could be assured of every possible help, should he have the desire to work in his former position.” In other words, according to Schieber, the judge at this trial worked for the Russians and was offering him a job. Schieber claimed to have told the judge that his offer sounded impossible. Was he really being advised to ignore the court’s judgment, to flee the camp, get an interzonal pass, and begin working for the Russians “at a high pay grade” comparable to what he was paid during the Hitler regime? “The President of the Spruchkammer assured [me] that arrangements would be made,” Schieber said. Did this really happen? Was the judge a Russian mole? Or was Schieber playing the Americans with the proverbial Russian card? Schieber’s Counter Intelligence Corps handler asked him what he thought of the judge’s black market offer. “Schieber believes that the [Spruchkammern] sentence was imposed to prevent his contract with the United States and to make his residence in Germany so difficult as to force him to accept the Russian Offers.” The handler had his own thoughts. “Cancellation of Schiebers [sic] contract after he has possibly jeopardized his safety and after he has cooperated so whole-heartedly with intelligence agencies here is certain to have an adverse effect on the future contracting or exploitation of specialists and will only serve as another example of broken faith on the part of the United States.” The CIC officer felt that when “considering the magnitude of Schiebers [sic] potential value to the United States either for military or civil exploitation,” it was obvious that his contract needed to be honored one way or other. The officer recommended that Schieber be paid as a consultant to the U.S. Army in Heidelberg. In the meantime, he could appeal the judgment of the Spruchkammern trial and become part of Operation Paperclip after the attention died down. The air force had already soured on Schieber. At the Pentagon, his case had been reviewed again. The air force now saw Schieber’s Nazi Party history in a wholly different light. In their eyes, Schieber had transformed from a brilliant engineer to a ruthless, greedy war profiteer. “Walther Schieber started his business career at the Gustloff Werke in Weimar, a combine owned by the Nazi Party and comprising five industrial corporations,” read the air force response. “He soon became the leader in the German Cellulose and Rayon Ring, which was the", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:Operation Paperclip_cleaned.txt:222:c2953c31f091", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 6135, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "Operation Paperclip_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/031622104X", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "Operation Paperclip_cleaned", "chunk_index": 223, "text": "his case had been reviewed again.

He founded Thuringische Zellwolle A.G. in Schwarza and subsequently gained control of the French Synthetic Fiber combine,” meaning that with the help of SS officers, Schieber had confiscated Jewish-owned businesses in France and made them the property of the Third Reich. “Schieber was appointed by Speer to the position of Chief of the Office for Delivery of Armament Goods in the Ministry for Armaments and Munitions and was named deputy leader of the National Group Industry by [Walter] Funk,” read the air force report. How he went from dealing fabrics to weapons production remained unclear, but his ambition had to have come into play. “Described as a top-ranking figure in the Nazi war economy, he is said to have constantly profited from being a party man,” noted the air force. There was only one conclusion: “Cancel Air Force request for Walter Schieber. Subject considered ineligible Paperclip.” United States European Command (EUCOM) headquarters in Frankfurt—various commands had different headquarters—cabled the JIOA office at the Pentagon to let them know that cancellation of the request was an unsound idea: “It is believed here that these considerations outweigh the risk of possible criticism of his being sent to the United States, and if necessary, warrant an exception to present policy. Further, it is considered advisable that for Schieber’s future personal safety and for intelligence reasons, he not be present… when and if official action against him occurs. Therefore it is strongly recommended that reconsideration be given the decision to cancel Schieber’s contract and that he be sent to the United States regardless of the outcome of his appeal.” EUCOM wanted Schieber moved out of Germany and sent to the United States—now. Nothing happened for three months—until Brigadier General Charles Loucks arrived in Heidelberg. After the second Schieber call came in to General Loucks’s office, Loucks told his lieutenant to set up a meeting with the man. As of 2013, their official meeting remains classified. But General Loucks wrote regularly in his desk diary, which fills in what the declassified Operation Paperclip case file on Schieber leaves out. On October 14, 1948, Dr. Schieber was invited to attend a roundtable conference at Army Chemical Corps headquarters in Heidelberg. “Classified matters” were discussed, Loucks penned in his journal that night. Schieber told Loucks he had been in on the Reich’s manufacturing of nerve gas “from the beginning.” He appealed", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:Operation Paperclip_cleaned.txt:223:ac0c61c4ace9", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 6136, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "Operation Paperclip_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/031622104X", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "Operation Paperclip_cleaned", "chunk_index": 224, "text": "of 2013, their official meeting remains classified.

Schieber told Loucks he had been in on the Reich’s manufacturing of nerve gas “from the beginning.” He appealed to General Loucks’s patriotic side. “I want you to know that if there is anything I can do to help the West I shall do it,” Schieber said. Loucks liked Schieber’s willingness to help the cause so much that he invited Schieber to join him at his house for a drink. That evening Loucks recorded his thoughts: “Attended conf. with… Dr. Walter Schieber— classified matters. No particular info but hope for more later, possibly when better acquainted. I’ll try to see him next time he reports in to Div. of Intell. He directed the production of war gases on a rather high echelon so doesn’t have the detailed knowledge that I want, but possibly I can get the names of useful people from him. Took him to the house for a drink.” Chemical weapons, like biological weapons, were perceived by some to be “dirty business,” as President Roosevelt once said. But to men like General Loucks and Walter Schieber, to advance a nation’s arsenal of chemical weapons was a challenging and necessary job. It “was more interesting than going down to Paris on weekends,” Loucks wrote in his journal. General Loucks asked to meet with Dr. Schieber again, this time to ask Schieber if he could assist with a “problem” the U.S. Army was having producing sarin gas. Schieber was happy to help. He told Loucks that during the war it was the Farben chemists who had produced sarin gas and that he knew all these chemists very well. They were his friends. “They worked with me during the war,” On October 28, 1948, Loucks and his wife, Pearl, hosted a dinner party in their home. Again, Schieber was a guest. Loucks had by now taken an extraordinary liking to Dr. Schieber and wrote his impressions of the man in his diary that night. “Schieber is interesting—an independent thinking, intelligent and very competent man. He related much of his experience with the Russians. A prisoner of war after the 1st World War for a year. He was an honorary (?) Brigade Fuehrer of SS this last war.

Is willing to do anything for the future of the world and Germany.” Why was General Loucks so willing to overlook SS-Brigadeführer Dr. Walter Schieber’s criminal past and his central role inside the Third Reich? A story that Charles Loucks told an army historian decades later sheds light on this question. At the end of World War II, after the Japanese surrendered, Colonel Loucks went to Tokyo, where he served as the chief chemical officer for the U.S. Army. Sometimes Loucks took day trips into the countryside. In the last five months of war in Japan, American bombers conducted a massive incendiary bombing campaign against sixty-seven Japanese cities that killed nearly a million citizens, most of whom burned to death. Still, the Japanese refused to surrender, and it took two atomic bombs to end the war. The incendiary bombs dropped on those sixty-seven cities were produced at the Rocky Mountain Arsenal. Colonel Loucks oversaw the production of tens of thousands of them. In Japan, after the fighting was over, and when Loucks took day trips, he often brought his camera along and took photographs of the landscape, the damage, and the dead. When Loucks returned home to America, he compiled these photographs into an album of more than one hundred black-and-white snapshots. One photograph in the album, which is archived at the U.S. Army Heritage Center in Pennsylvania, shows Colonel Loucks standing next to an enormous pile of dead bodies. Years later Colonel Loucks explained to the army historian what the photograph meant to him. “Driving one day in a Jeep from Yokohama to Tokyo, I stopped along the side of a road. The incendiary attacks had done their work,” Loucks explained. The area “was all burned out; a wasteland all the way through. We dropped tens of thousands of them [incendiary bombs] on the whole area between Yokohama and Tokyo.” Out there in the Japanese countryside, said Loucks, “I noticed a great stack of incendiary bombs— small ones. I went over to take a look at them. They looked like something that we had made at Rocky Mountain. Sure enough, they were. Here in one place they had a great stack of them. They were burned out but the bodies were still there because they didn’t burn. They stacked them up in this big high pile. I had a picture of me standing beside them, because I had been responsible for the manufacturing of them. That was just one of those", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:Operation Paperclip_cleaned.txt:225:ca0c37f61e53", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 6138, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "Operation Paperclip_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/031622104X", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "Operation Paperclip_cleaned", "chunk_index": 226, "text": "to take a look at them.

I had a picture of me standing beside them, because I had been responsible for the manufacturing of them. That was just one of those incidents that didn’t mean anything, but I just happened to see what had happened to some of our incendiary bombs that were over there.” In describing the photograph—an enormous pile of dead bodies next to a stack of incendiary bombs—Colonel Loucks expressed a peculiar kind of detachment. To the army historian interviewing him, Loucks made clear that what interested him in the photograph was noting the effectiveness—or in this case ineffectiveness—of the bombs he had been responsible for manufacturing. Similarly, Loucks expressed detachment as far as Dr. Schieber was concerned, as evidenced in his journal entries. It was as if Loucks could not, or would not, see Schieber in the context of the millions of Jews murdered on the direct orders of Schieber’s closest wartime colleagues. What interested Loucks about Schieber was what an effective chemical weapons maker he was. During the next meeting between General Loucks and Dr. Schieber, Loucks got very specific with Schieber in terms of what he was after. “Could you develop the process and put it on paper with drawings, specifications and tables and safety regulations to make Sarin?” Loucks asked, as noted in his desk diary. Loucks recalled the next conversation the two men had. “He said they had a big works outside of Berlin that was just completed when the war was over and made little token amounts but no production. When [the Reich] announced that the Russians were taking over, those engineers and chemists both came West into the American and British occupied zones.” Schieber was lying to General Loucks. The nerve gas production plant outside Berlin to which Schieber referred was Falkenhagen, and it was run by Otto Ambros’s deputy and the man who had stashed the steel drum outside Gendorf, Jürgen von Klenck. By war’s end, the factory at Falkenhagen had produced more than five hundred tons of sarin gas, hardly “little token amounts,” as Schieber claimed. If Loucks had read von Klenck’s OMGUS security report, or any of the CIOS reports written by Major Edmund Tilley, he would have learned that Schieber was lying to him. Instead, General Loucks asked Schieber if he could locate these chemists who knew so much about sarin production and bring them to Heidelberg. He held out to Schieber the promise of a U.S. Army contract. Further, “We will pay all their [the chemists’] expenses and give them something for their work,” Loucks said.", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:Operation Paperclip_cleaned.txt:226:6b53067e0959", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 6139, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "Operation Paperclip_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/031622104X", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "Operation Paperclip_cleaned", "chunk_index": 227, "text": "read von Klenck’s OMGUS security report, or any of the CIOS reports written by Major Edmund Tilley, he would have learned that Schieber was lying to him.

He held out to Schieber the promise of a U.S. Army contract. Further, “We will pay all their [the chemists’] expenses and give them something for their work,” Loucks said. On October 29, 1948, Colonel Loucks wrote a memorandum to the chief of the Army Chemical Corps. The best, fastest way to get German technical information on tabun and sarin gas was to hire Dr. Schieber, Colonel Loucks advised. In his diary, Loucks wrote, “ Hope the chief will support us. If he does, we’ll be able to get all of the German CW technical ability on our side and promptly. They know on what side they belong. All we need to do is treat them as human beings. They recognize the military defeat and the political and ideological defeat as well and accept it.” One week later, General Loucks told Schieber that he had been authorized to pay him 1,000 marks a month for consulting work. Schieber gave Loucks the contact information for the six chemists and technicians who would join him in his efforts to explain precisely how to produce sarin gas. On December 11, 1948, Loucks hosted the first roundtable meeting of Hitler’s chemists in his Heidelberg home, secrecy assured. For the next three months, the chemists met every other Saturday at Loucks’s home. There, they created detailed, step-by-step reports on how to produce industrial amounts of sarin gas. They drew charts and graphs and made lists of materials and equipment required. Years later, Loucks reflected, “One of the team [members] was a young engineer who had an excellent command of English which helped greatly and was his major contribution [and that was] Jurgend [sic] von Klenck.” When the work was finally compiled and sent to Edgewood, the results were the perfect recipe for the deadly nerve agent. According to General Loucks, without Hitler’s chemists, the American program had been a failure. With them, it was a success. “That’s when we built the plant out in Rocky Mountain Arsenal,” Loucks explained. The incendiary bombs that Colonel Loucks oversaw at Rocky Mountain Arsenal during World War II would now be replaced by M34 cluster bombs filled with sarin gas. The Top Secret program was code-named Gibbett-Delivery. A friendship between two brigadier generals, Loucks and Schieber, had been solidified. The following summer, Schieber sent Loucks a thank-you note and a gift, not identified in the records but described by Schieber as a piece of “equipment… that once stood at the beginning of the same work group.” The unknown item had been used by Schieber during the Nazi era, when", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:Operation Paperclip_cleaned.txt:227:6ebd92aeb85c", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 6140, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "Operation Paperclip_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/031622104X", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "Operation Paperclip_cleaned", "chunk_index": 228, "text": "now be replaced by M34 cluster bombs filled with sarin gas.

Over the next eight years the two brigadier generals exchanged Christmas cards. But General Loucks noted in his diary that he had every intention of defying this superior’s request. He had become good friends with the German chemists. He regularly had meals with Walter Schieber and Richard Kuhn, and, on at least one occasion, Schieber had spent the night at Loucks’s house. “I’ll see them anyhow,” he wrote, in a diary entry dated February 1, 1950. The following day, Loucks was called back in to the Pentagon. “Went to Pentagon,” he wrote, “long session with H.Q. Int. [headquarters, intelligence] people… seemed interested in what we are doing [in Heidelberg]— would give me money necessary to exploit the Germans for scientific and technical intelligence.” In other words, what some at the Pentagon refused to condone, others were willing to support through covert means. General Loucks’s secret Saturday roundtable at his house in Heidelberg with the Nazi chemists remained hidden from the public for six decades. Here was a brigadier general with the U.S. Army doing business with a former brigadier general of the Third Reich allegedly in the interests of the United States. It was a Cold War black program that was paid for by the U.S. Army but did not officially exist. There were no checks and no balances. Operation Paperclip was becoming a headless monster. The CIA’s working relationship with the JIOA and Operation Paperclip had begun within a few months of the Agency’s creation. Within the CIA, Paperclip was managed inside the Office of Collection and Dissemination, and one of the first things requested by its administrator, L. T. Shannon, was “a photostatted copy of a set of files compiled by Dr. Werner Osenberg and consisting of biographical records of approximately 18,000 German scientists.” By the winter of 1948, hundreds of memos were going back and forth between the JIOA and the CIA. Sometimes the CIA would request information from the JIOA on certain scientists, and sometimes the JIOA would ask the CIA to provide it with intelligence on a specific scientist or group of scientists. Also in the first three months of the CIA’s existence, the National Security Council issued Directive No. 3, dealing specifically with the “production of intelligence and the coordination of intelligence production activities within the intelligence community.” The National Security Council wanted to know who was", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:Operation Paperclip_cleaned.txt:228:8db6cb03bc71", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 6141, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "Operation Paperclip_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/031622104X", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "Operation Paperclip_cleaned", "chunk_index": 229, "text": "the CIA.

Also in the first three months of the CIA’s existence, the National Security Council issued Directive No. 3, dealing specifically with the “production of intelligence and the coordination of intelligence production activities within the intelligence community.” The National Security Council wanted to know who was producing what intelligence and how that information was being coordinated among agencies. In the opinion of the CIA, “the link between scientific planning and military research on a national scale did not hitherto exist.” The result was the creation of the Scientific Intelligence Committee (SIC), chaired by the CIA and with members from the army, the navy, the air force, the State Department, and the Atomic Energy Commission. “Very early in its existence the SIC undertook to define scientific intelligence, delineate areas of particular interest and establish committees to handle these areas,” wrote SIC chairman Dr. Karl Weber, in a CIA monograph that remained classified until September 2008. “Priority was accorded to atomic energy, biological warfare, chemical warfare, electronic warfare, guided missiles, aircraft, undersea warfare and medicine”—every area involving Operation Paperclip scientists. Eight scientific intelligence subcommittees were created, one for each area of warfare. Despite the urgency, the JIOA’s plan to make Operation Paperclip over into a long-term program was still at a standstill. By the spring of 1948, half of the one thousand German scientists bound for America had arrived, but not a single one of them had a visa. Troublemaker Samuel Klaus was gone from the State Department, but the JIOA could still not get the visa division to make things happen fast enough. On May 11, 1948, military intelligence chief General Stephen J. Chamberlin, the man who had briefed Eisenhower in 1947, took matters into his own hands. Chamberlin went to meet FBI director J. Edgar Hoover to enlist his help with visas. Cold War paranoia was on the rise, and both men were staunch anti-Communists. The success of Operation Paperclip, said Chamberlin, was essential to national security. The FBI had the Communists to fear, not the Nazis. Hoover agreed. Paperclip recruits needed the promise of American citizenship now more than ever, Chamberlin said, before any more of them were stolen away by the Russians. Chamberlin asked Hoover to put pressure on the State Department. J. Edgar Hoover said he would see what he could do. What, if anything, Hoover did remains a mystery. Three months later, the first seven scientists had U.S. immigrant visas. Now it was time to put the transition process to the test.

Now it was time to put the transition process to the test. For Operation Paperclip, moving a scientist from military custody to immigrant status required elaborate and devious preparation, but in the end the procedure proved to be infallible. Scientists in the southwestern or western United States, accompanied by military escort, were driven in an unmarked army jeep out of the country into Mexico either at Nuevo Laredo, Ciudad Juárez, or Tijuana. With him, each scientist carried two forms from the State Department, I-55 and I-255, each bearing a signature from the chief of the visa division and a proviso from the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Section 42.323 of Title 22, signifying that the visa holder was “a person whose admission is highly desirable in the national interest.” The scientist also had with him a photograph of himself and a blood test warranting that he did not have any infectious diseases. After consulate approval, the scientist was then let back into the United States, no longer under military guard but as a legal U.S. immigrant in possession of a legal visa. The pathway toward citizenship had begun. If the scientist lived closer to the East Coast than the West Coast, he went through the same protocols, except that he would exit the United States into Canada instead of Mexico and reenter through the consulate at Niagara Falls. It was an international crisis in June of 1948 that finally gave Operation Paperclip its long-term momentum. Early on the morning of June 24, the Soviets cut off all land and rail access to the American zone in Berlin. This action would become known as the Berlin Blockade, and it was seen as one of the first major international crises of the Cold War. “The Soviet blockade of Berlin in 1948 clearly indicated that the wartime alliance [between the Soviets and the United States] had dissolved,” explained CIA deputy director for operations Jack Downing. “Germany then became a new battlefield between east and west.” The CIA presence in Germany was redoubled as its plans for covert action against the Soviets shifted into high gear. The CIA needed to hire thousands of foreign nationals living in Germany to help in this effort—spies, saboteurs, and scientists—many of whom had spent time in displaced-persons camps and interrogation facilities operated by the U.S. Army in the American zone of occupied Germany. Initially, the CIA and the JIOA worked hand in glove inside Germany to thwart Soviet threats, but soon the two agencies would start competing for German scientists and spies.

Initially, the CIA and the JIOA worked hand in glove inside Germany to thwart Soviet threats, but soon the two agencies would start competing for German scientists and spies. The two agencies worked together inside a clandestine intelligence facility in the American zone informally called Camp King. The activities there between 1946 and the late 1950s have never been fully accounted for by either the Department of Defense or the CIA. Camp King was strategically located in the village of Oberursel, just eleven miles northwest of the United States European Command (EUCOM) headquarters in Frankfurt. Officially the facility had two other names: the U.S. Military Intelligence Service Center at Oberursel and the 7707th European Command Intelligence Center. A small plaque in a park outside the officers’ club explained to visitors the significance of the informal name. Colonel Charles B. King, an intelligence officer, had been in the process of accepting the surrender of a group of Nazis on Utah Beach in June 1944 when he was double-crossed and slain by a “strong and concentrated barrage of enemy artillery fire.” There was tragic irony in the name. Camp King had become home to many well-intentioned American officers trying to make deals with untrustworthy enemies. Many of these American officers would be double-crossed and at least one of them would be killed. A lot had changed at Camp King since John Dolibois had personally delivered six Nazi Bonzen here in August 1945. The interrogation facility had become one of the most clandestine U.S. intelligence centers in Western Europe, and for more than a decade it would function as a Cold War black site long before black sites were known as such. Camp King was a joint interrogation center and the intelligence agencies that shared access to prisoners here included Army Intelligence, Air Force Intelligence, Naval Intelligence, and the CIA. By 1948, most of its prisoners were Soviet-bloc spies. How the CIA used Camp King remains one of the Agency’s most closely guarded secrets. It was here in Oberursel that the CIA first began developing “extreme interrogation” techniques and “behavior modification programs” under the code names Operation Bluebird and Operation Artichoke. The unorthodox methods the CIA and its partner agencies explored included hypnosis, electric shock, chemicals, and illegal street drugs. Camp King was chosen as an ideal place to do this work in part because it was “off-site” but mainly because of its access to prisoners believed to be Soviet spies. When the Americans captured the facility in the spring of 1945, the Nazis had been using it as an interrogation facility for Allied fliers.

When the Americans captured the facility in the spring of 1945, the Nazis had been using it as an interrogation facility for Allied fliers. Camp King’s first commanding officer was Colonel William Russell Philp, and through the fall of 1945, Philp shared the Military Intelligence Service Center at Oberursel with General William J. Donovan, founding director of the Office of Strategic Services. General Donovan oversaw an operation here whereby high-ranking Nazi generals, including those dropped off by John Dolibois, were paid to write intelligence reports on subjects like German order of battle and Nazi Party chain of command. Dolibois, fluent in German, acted as Donovan’s liaison to the Nazi prisoners during this time. General Donovan kept an office at Oberursel until the OSS was disbanded in September 1945, after which he returned to Washington, D.C., and civilian life. Colonel Philp’s job was to handle the rest of the prisoners. In the months that followed war’s end, the Camp King prisoner population grew to include Russian defectors and captured Soviet spies. There was valuable intelligence to be gained from these individuals, Philp learned, willingly or through coercion. But Philp also found that his officers lacked a greater context within which to interpret the raw intelligence being gathered from the Soviets. Russia had been America’s ally during the war. Now it was the enemy. The Soviets were masters of disinformation. Who was telling the truth? The Nazi prisoners claimed to know, and Colonel Philp began using several of them to interpret and analyze information from Soviet defectors. These Nazis were “experts in espionage against the Russians,” Philp later said. Two of them seemed particularly knowledgeable: Gerhard Wessel, who had been an officer in the German intelligence organization Abwehr, and Wessel’s deputy, Hermann Baun. Philp put the men to work. What started out as a “research project using POWs” became a “gradual drift into operations,” said Philp. He moved the Nazis into a safe house on the outskirts of Camp King, code-named Haus Blue, where they oversaw counterintelligence operations against the Soviets under the code name Project Keystone. Philp found that working with Nazis was a slippery slope, and in a matter of months the Germans had transformed from prisoners to paid intelligence assets of the U.S. Army. In the summer of 1946 a major event occurred that influenced the CIA’s future role in Operation Paperclip and Camp King. Major General Reinhard Gehlen, former head of the Nazis’ intelligence operation against the Soviets, arrived at Camp King. Gehlen had been in the United States under interrogation since 1945. Here at Oberursel, Army Intelligence decided to make Gehlen head of its entire “anti-Communist intelligence", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:Operation Paperclip_cleaned.txt:232:d36f3580c2c1", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 6145, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "Operation Paperclip_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/031622104X", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "Operation Paperclip_cleaned", "chunk_index": 233, "text": "months the Germans had transformed from prisoners to paid intelligence assets of the U.S. Army.

Major General Reinhard Gehlen, former head of the Nazis’ intelligence operation against the Soviets, arrived at Camp King. Gehlen had been in the United States under interrogation since 1945. Here at Oberursel, Army Intelligence decided to make Gehlen head of its entire “anti-Communist intelligence organization,” under the code name Operation Rusty. Eventually the organization would become known simply as the Gehlen Organization. A network of former Nazi intelligence agents, the majority of whom were members of the SS, began working out of offices at Camp King side by side with army intelligence officers. Colonel Philp was in charge of overall supervision. By late 1947, the Gehlen Organization had gotten so large it required its own headquarters. Army intelligence moved the organization to a self-contained facility outside Munich, in a village called Pullach. This compound was the former estate of Martin Bormann and had large grounds, sculpture gardens, and a pool. The two facilities, at Oberursel and Pullach, worked together. Gehlen and Baun claimed to have six hundred intelligence agents, all former Nazis, in the Soviet zone of occupied Germany alone. According to documents kept classified for fifty-one years, relations between Gehlen and Philp declined and became hostile as Philp finally realized the true nature of who he was dealing with. The Gehlen Organization was a murderous bunch, “free-wheeling” and out of control. As one CIA affiliate observed, “American intelligence is a rich blind man using the Abwehr as a seeing-eye dog. The only trouble is—the leash is much too long.” The army became fed up with the Gehlen Organization, but there was no way out. Its operatives were professional double-crossers and liars—many were also alleged war criminals—and now they had the army over a barrel. Decades later it would emerge that General Gehlen was reportedly earning a million dollars a year. In late 1948, CIA director Roscoe Hillenkoetter met with army intelligence to discuss the CIA’s taking charge of the Gehlen Organization. The two parties agreed, and on July 1, 1949, the CIA officially assumed control of Gehlen and his men. That same summer, the CIA created the Office of Scientific Intelligence (OSI), and its first director, Dr. Willard Machle, traveled to Germany to set up a program for “special interrogation methods” against Soviet spies. The CIA had intelligence indicating that the Soviets had developed mind control programs. The Agency wanted to know what it would be up against if the Russians got hold of its American spies.

The facility offered unique access to Soviet spies who had been caught in the Gehlen Organization’s web. Revolutionary new interrogation techniques could be practiced on these men under the operational code name Bluebird. A limited number of official CIA documents remain on record from this program. Most were destroyed by CIA director Richard Helms. Initially the CIA envisioned Operation Bluebird as a “defensive” program. Officers from Scientific Intelligence were “to apply special methods of interrogation for the purpose of evaluation of Russian practices.” But very quickly the Agency decided that in order to master the best defensive methods it needed to first develop the most cuttingedge offensive techniques. This sounded like doublespeak and was indicative of the Cold War mindset that was taking hold in intelligence circles and also in the military. The CIA believed it needed to develop the sharpest sword to create the strongest, most impenetrable shield. Operation Bluebird was just the beginning. Soon the program would expand to include mind control techniques and Nazi doctors recruited under Operation Paperclip. In the fall of 1948, in Germany, one of the most unusual press conferences of the Cold War took place. Major General Walter Schreiber, the former surgeon general of the Third Reich, had last been seen on the stand at Nuremberg testifying against fellow members of the Nazi high command. Then, on November 2, 1948, he reappeared at a press conference. After three years, five months, and three days in Soviet custody, Schreiber had allegedly “escaped” from his Soviet captors. Now the vaccine specialist said he had important news to share with the free world. The press conference opened with Schreiber delivering a brief statement about what had happened to him—he’d been a prisoner of the Soviets since the fall of Berlin and had recently escaped—followed by a lengthy question-andanswer period with an American official acting as translator. The first question asked by a reporter was, How did Schreiber manage to escape? “How was it possible the Russians let him get out?” asked another member of the press, a question on everyone’s mind. In the two years since General Schreiber’s stunning testimony at Nuremberg, he’d been made starshina, or elder, in the Soviet military. It was almost inconceivable that a major player like Schreiber simply slipped away from his Soviet guards. Yet here he was. In November 1948, Berlin was a city under psychological and physical siege.

In the two years since General Schreiber’s stunning testimony at Nuremberg, he’d been made starshina, or elder, in the Soviet military. It was almost inconceivable that a major player like Schreiber simply slipped away from his Soviet guards. Yet here he was. In November 1948, Berlin was a city under psychological and physical siege. For more than four months now, the Soviets had blocked all rail, canal, and road access between East and West Berlin. To feed the civilians in the western zone, the Americans were flying in airplanes full of food. Schreiber’s “escape” happened during the height of the Berlin Blockade. Pressed further, Major General Dr. Schreiber reconstructed some of the events in his tale of escape. He’d been in Soviet Russia until the summer, he said. There, he and a group of other former Nazi generals lived together in a villa outside Berlin. In July or August, six of the generals, including Schreiber, were unexpectedly transported to a country house on the German-Polish border, near Frankfurt on the Oder, east of Berlin (not to be confused with Frankfurt on the Main, located in the American zone, southwest of Berlin). With regard to this mysterious journey and its greater purpose, Major General Schreiber said, “We were not asked, but we were told that we were going to join the police.” Only then, Schreiber explained, did he learn he had been “appointed Chief Medical officer for the newly formed [East] German police.” Schreiber said he was offered “food, clothing, housing, furniture… for advantages.” Four of the Nazi generals agreed to take the job. Schreiber said he objected. He was a scientist, not a policeman, he claimed to have told his Soviet handlers. The group of generals was transported to a home in Saxony, close to the Czechoslovakian border. Finally, “The last day of September, the four [generals] who had agreed were sent to Berlin in order to start their jobs,” Schreiber said. He and another general, who had by this time also voiced objection, remained “guarded by police.” Two days later Schreiber was sent to Dresden, in the Soviet zone. “There we were very well received, and I was offered the chance to become professor at the University of Leipzig,” Schreiber told the press corps. “I demanded the University of Berlin. I had special reason for this demand. That was denied of me. For this reason, I made myself free.” So that was that. A chorus of West German reporters wanted more details. How does one simply make oneself free of Soviet military police, especially if one is the former surgeon general of the Third Reich? For the Soviets, turning high-ranking Nazi generals into Communist officials was an immense propaganda coup in the early days of the Cold War.

How does one simply make oneself free of Soviet military police, especially if one is the former surgeon general of the Third Reich? For the Soviets, turning high-ranking Nazi generals into Communist officials was an immense propaganda coup in the early days of the Cold War. One had to assume that Soviet military intelligence (Glavnoye Razvedyvatel’noye Upravleniye, or GRU) was keeping a watchful eye on each of the generals through their transition from Soviet Russia into the East German zone. The GRU’s notorious official emblem featured an omnipotent bat hovering above the globe. The GRU kept radarlike track of people. They had eyes in the night. To allow Dr. Schreiber to get away sounded implausible. Next, Schreiber began to lecture his audience on the Soviet threat. He singled out a former colleague, Vincenz Müller, to blame, not unlike what he had done with Dr. Blome before the International Military Tribunal at Nuremberg. Lieutenant General Vincenz Müller was a dangerous man, exclaimed Schreiber. Now that he’d gone over to the Russian side, he was a threat to world peace. Lieutenant General Müller had recently been installed by the Soviet government as the new police leader in Berlin, Schreiber said. “He is a fanatical communist,” promised Schreiber, “completely devoted to the Russians. This is all the more astonishing as Müller comes from a very devout Catholic family.” The Russians had plans to arm Müller’s new Berlin police force with “heavy weapons, tanks, [and] artillery.” The Soviets had only one goal, Schreiber promised, and that was world domination. It was beginning right now with the rearmament of East Berlin. Another news reporter asked, “Were you wearing your [Soviet] uniform” when you escaped? It was a good question. If Schreiber had been wearing his Soviet uniform, then clearly he would have been noticed by border patrol guards, stopped, and questioned as he passed from the Soviet zone to the American zone of occupation. If Schreiber had not been wearing his Soviet uniform, then the obvious next question was, Why not? Schreiber’s answer was convoluted. His Soviet uniform happened to be at the tailors’ shop on the day of his escape, he said, getting new shoulder straps and embroidery on the collar. To emphasize his point, Schreiber even went so far as to re-create a conversation between himself and his Soviet handler—a man named “Fisher”—regarding the missing uniform. “Fisher said [to me], ‘You are going to get [your uniform] later. For the time being, this is not yet possible.’” As it turned out, Schreiber’s press conference was not impromptu but rehearsed. He had been discussing his testimony with officers from the U.S. Counter Intelligence Corps for two weeks—since October 18, 1948, the day he had walked into", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:Operation Paperclip_cleaned.txt:236:177a9e705643", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 6149, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "Operation Paperclip_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/031622104X", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "Operation Paperclip_cleaned", "chunk_index": 237, "text": "even went so far as to re-create a conversation between himself and his Soviet handler—a man named “Fisher”—regarding the missing uniform. “Fisher said [to me], ‘You are going to get [your uniform] later.

He had been discussing his testimony with officers from the U.S. Counter Intelligence Corps for two weeks—since October 18, 1948, the day he had walked into the CIC’s Berlin office. CIC special agent Severin F. Wallach was Schreiber’s handler. Wallach had heard a much longer version of what had allegedly been going on with Schreiber since his capture by the Red Army during the fall of Berlin. According to the thirteen-page report by Wallach in Schreiber’s intelligence dossier, “On the 5th of May Dr. Schreiber was sent, together with other captured German Generals, back to Berlin. The Generals were put in a cellar of the Reich Chancellery in Berlin and received orders to emerge from this cellar under strong Soviet guard. This whole scene was photographed by the Soviets, who were engaged in putting together an ‘authentic’ documentary film of the capture of Berlin.” On May 9, with the Reich’s surrender complete, Dr. Schreiber was sent with other officers to a much larger prisoner of war camp, in Posen, where he stayed until August 12, 1945. A transport of generals to Moscow had been organized; Schreiber said he arrived there on August 29. “The transport was very badly organized,” Schreiber said, according to the dossier report. “There was a food shortage because the cooks on the transport sold the food on the black market or kept it for themselves.” Schreiber’s testimony was resplendent with details. “All generals were sent to the PW camp No. 7027 in Krasnogorsk, near Moscow,” he recalled. Here, the food tasted wonderful because it came from the United States, in cans. Schreiber repeatedly told Wallach how much he loved everything about the United States. On March 12, 1946, Schreiber said he was transferred to the Lubyanka prison in Moscow. “Treatment not bad.” On March 20 he claimed to have been interrogated by the Russians for the first time: “Subject was The German Preparation for Biological Warfare.” Wallach had to have known that this was highly improbable. Schreiber was one of the Third Reich’s highest-ranking medical doctors, and he was a major general in the army. On March 20, 1946, he would have been in Soviet custody for ten months. That this was his first interrogation was absurd. Schreiber told Wallach he was questioned by a lieutenant general named Kabulow for three days. Kabulow didn’t believe his testimony, Schreiber said, and so he was told, “Soviet interrogators are going to use now physical violence to break [you] and get the whole truth out of [you].” The next interrogation, recalled Schreiber, took place at", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:Operation Paperclip_cleaned.txt:237:5e3e28a507ab", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 6150, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "Operation Paperclip_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/031622104X", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "Operation Paperclip_cleaned", "chunk_index": 238, "text": "in the army.

Kabulow didn’t believe his testimony, Schreiber said, and so he was told, “Soviet interrogators are going to use now physical violence to break [you] and get the whole truth out of [you].” The next interrogation, recalled Schreiber, took place at three o’clock that same morning. “[I was] beaten by a Soviet officer who me knows as Lt. Smirnow [Smirnov]. Together with a Col. Walter Stern, who speaks German without the slightest accent and who [was] an excellent interrogator.” Schreiber said he withstood three weeks of rough interrogation, at which point he finally broke down and “wrote the statement which later on was submitted by the Soviet Government to the International War Crimes Tribunal in Nuremberg.” He was flown from Moscow to Berlin, then down to Nuremberg to testify at the war crimes trial. During one of the flights Schreiber said his Germanspeaking Soviet interrogator, Colonel Stern, leaned over and whispered a warning to him. If Schreiber were to go off-book and say “anything detrimental to the interests of the Soviet Union, he would be hanged on his return to Russia.” After testifying at Nuremberg, Schreiber said he was taken back to the Soviet Union, where he and three generals were set up in a two-story country house in Tomilino, sixteen miles southeast of Moscow. One of the three generals was Field Marshal Friedrich Paulus—the highest-ranking Nazi general to ever have surrendered to the Soviets, which Paulus did during the Battle of Stalingrad. Paulus’s own story, of the events leading up to his capture and his final communication with Hitler, was remarkable. The Soviets had also brought Paulus to testify at Nuremberg. As William Shirer explained in The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich, the last days of Paulus’s command during the battle for Stalingrad were cataclysmic. “Paulus, torn between his duty to obey the mad Fuehrer and his obligation to save his own surviving troops from annihilation, appealed to Hitler.” Paulus sent an urgent message to the Führer that read, “Troops without ammunition or food… Effective command no longer possible… 18,000 wounded without any supplies or dressings or drugs… Further defense senseless. Collapse inevitable. Army requests immediate permission to surrender in order to save lives of remaining troops.” But Hitler refused to allow Paulus to surrender. “Surrender is forbidden,” Hitler wrote in return, “Sixth Army will hold their positions to the last man and the last round and by their heroic endurance will make an unforgettable contribution toward the establishment of a defensive front and the salvation of the Western world.” “Heroic endurance” was a euphemism for suicide. Paulus was now supposed to kill himself. Hitler nudged him further", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:Operation Paperclip_cleaned.txt:238:6a13d70c58f2", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 6151, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "Operation Paperclip_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/031622104X", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "Operation Paperclip_cleaned", "chunk_index": 239, "text": "surrender in order to save lives of remaining troops.” But Hitler refused to allow Paulus to surrender. “Surrender is forbidden,” Hitler wrote in return, “Sixth Army will hold their positions to the last man and the last round and by their heroic endurance will make an unforgettable contribution toward the establishment of a defensive front and the salvation of the Western world.” “Heroic endurance” was a euphemism for suicide. Paulus was now supposed to kill himself. Hitler nudged him further in this direction by making Paulus a field marshal in what he hoped would be the last hour of the general’s life. “There is no record in military history of a German Field Marshal being taken prisoner,” Hitler told Alfred Jodl, who was standing next to him at the time. Instead, at 7:45 the following morning, Field Marshal Paulus surrendered. His last message to Hitler: “The Russians are at the door of our bunker. We are destroying our equipment.” He was taken prisoner shortly thereafter. What Paulus left behind was, as described by Shirer, a terrifying scene: “91,000 German soldiers, including twenty-four generals, half-starved, frostbitten, many of them wounded, all of them dazed and broken, were hobbling over the ice and snow, clutching their bloodcaked blankets over their heads against the 24-degrees-below-zero cold toward the dreary, frozen prisoner-of-war camps of Siberia.” Of the ninety-one thousand Germans taken prisoner by the Soviets, only five thousand would come out of the prison camps alive. Paulus was one of them. By 1947, he was living comfortably in this two-story country house with Major General Dr. Schreiber, outside Berlin. Actually, explained Schreiber, there were a total of four former Nazi generals living together under one roof. In addition to Field Marshal Friedrich Paulus, there was Lieutenant General Vincenz Müller, captured outside Minsk in 1944, and General Erich Buschenhagen, captured in eastern Romania in August 1944. For what purpose? Wallach asked. “Subject [Schreiber] is convinced Lt. Gen Vincenz Mueller was ordered by the Soviets to indoctrinate Professor Dr. Schreiber with communistic ideas.” Whatever the real reason, Schreiber said he and his fellow generals lived a relatively enjoyable life full of Soviet perks. At one point General Schreiber and General Buschenhagen were taken to live “in Moscow in a nicely furnished private house.” Their Soviet handler, with them constantly, “acted as a guide and took them to the museum, opera and to play-houses stressing the fact that Soviet Russia has a highly developed culture.” For Schreiber, the motive was clear. “This, too, was of course part of the planned indoctrination program,” he told Special Agent Wallach. All the while, Schreiber feigned that he was a happy Communist. In July 1947, Field Marshal Paulus became sick and the group was “taken to a summer resort, Livadia, on the Crimea.” There was no shortage of irony here.

In July 1947, Field Marshal Paulus became sick and the group was “taken to a summer resort, Livadia, on the Crimea.” There was no shortage of irony here. This was the same palatial resort at which the Yalta Conference took place, in February 1945. The dangerous Lieutenant General Vincenz Müller was with Paulus and Schreiber at the resort. The group stayed through the summer and returned to Moscow, by private jet, when the summer weather passed. For the next year, the former Nazi generals resided again at the country house in Tomilino, Schreiber said. Only now they were heavily engaged in antifascist courses that the Soviets required them to take. Studying kept the generals occupied until September 7, 1948. That’s when Schreiber said he learned that he and twenty-five other former Nazi generals would be leaving for East Germany at once. After Schreiber said no to the police job, he was brought to Dresden and put up in the Hotel Weisser Hirsch, at Bergbahnstrasse 12. His handler, the man called Fisher, agreed to release him from police work, Schreiber said. Fisher stepped away to work on arrangements regarding Schreiber’s teaching position. According to Schreiber, that was when he got away. Special Agent Wallach summarized the details. “Subject remained alone without anybody looking after him… Subject simply took a train in Dresden on the 17th and arrived in Berlin on the same day. After contacting his family in Berlin… subject established contact with this agent… and was since then under the protection of U.S. authorities in Berlin. At the end of October subject was evacuated with his family to the U.S. Zone for detailed exploitation by ECIC [European Command Intelligence Center],” Camp King. Was Schreiber a double agent? Was he a true-to-life James Bond? How was he able to resist the Soviets’ notoriously brutal interrogation techniques when so many others—from hardened generals to civilians to spies—were beaten into human ruin? Was he a charlatan? Or a weasel of a man, uniquely skilled at saving his own hide? What was he really doing in Soviet Russia for three and a half years? Special Agent Wallach drew his own conclusion. “Subject made an excellent impression on the undersigned agent. It is not believed that subject is a Soviet plant,” wrote Wallach. He signed his name in black ink. Army, EUCOM, with a memo written by Wallach’s CIC superior marked “Secret-Confidential.” It read: “Subject [Schreiber] claims to know everybody in his transport, their background, political attitude and new job assignments… Will be ready for transfer to your headquarters for detailed interrogation in about six days.” Schreiber had told Wallach he had information on", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:Operation Paperclip_cleaned.txt:240:90baff354591", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 6153, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "Operation Paperclip_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/031622104X", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "Operation Paperclip_cleaned", "chunk_index": 241, "text": "an excellent impression on the undersigned agent.

On November 3, 1948, the director of the Intelligence Division of the U.S. Army sent a telegram marked “Secret” to JIOA headquarters at the Pentagon, with a copy also sent to the Joint Chiefs of Staff. “If the Surgeon General replies that Schreiber is of importance to national security, his case should be processed under JCS procedure for immigration to the U.S.” Major General Dr. Prof. Walter Schreiber, the former surgeon general of the Third Reich, was about to become part of Operation Paperclip. In the meantime, he and his family were taken to Camp King and put up in a safe house there. When General Charles E. Loucks learned that Schreiber was in U.S. custody, he traveled to Camp King to interview him. Loucks was the man who had welcomed Hitler’s chemists into his home in Heidelberg to work on the secret formula for sarin production. He was particularly interested in learning from Dr. Schreiber about vaccines or serums produced by the Reich to defend against nerve agents. Loucks found Schreiber to be “cooperative in all respects” and hired him to work for the U.S. Chemical Corps “in compiling data concerning the Nazi Chemical Corps.” To oversee the project, General Loucks traveled back and forth from Heidelberg to Camp King. Next, Schreiber was hired to write a monograph for the U.S. Army about his experiences in Russia. When Loucks was finished working with Schreiber, he was asked by Camp King’s commanding officer, Lieutenant Colonel Gordon D. Ingraham, if he would testify as to Schreiber’s character for the doctor’s OMGUS security report. Given Schreiber’s position as a general in the Nazi high command, it was going to take serious effort on the part of JIOA to bring Schreiber into the United States. Loucks agreed but was uncharacteristically skeptical of the Nazi general’s motivations. “Loucks stated subject was energetic and a good organizer of work projects.… Schreiber had apparently given accurate information [to Loucks] on all occasions [which has] been checked and confirmed by Technical Research experts in the United States.… However, Loucks stated that Schreiber may also have given this same information ‘to the Russians.’” Loucks told Lieutenant Colonel Ingraham that he “believed that Schreiber could be persuaded by any attractive offer.” In other words, Schreiber’s loyalty could be bought. At Camp King, Dr. Schreiber and his family were", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:Operation Paperclip_cleaned.txt:241:7205f4cc14ab", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 6154, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "Operation Paperclip_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/031622104X", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "Operation Paperclip_cleaned", "chunk_index": 242, "text": "a good organizer of work projects.… Schreiber had apparently given accurate information [to Loucks] on all occasions [which has] been checked and confirmed by Technical Research experts in the United States.… However, Loucks stated that Schreiber may also have given this same information ‘to the Russians.’” Loucks told Lieutenant Colonel Ingraham that he “believed that Schreiber could be persuaded by any attractive offer.” In other words, Schreiber’s loyalty could be bought. At Camp King, Dr. Schreiber and his family were moved into a nice home provided by the U.S. Army. Despite General Loucks’s concern about Schreiber’s trustworthiness, in November 1949 Major General Dr. Walter Schreiber was hired by army intelligence to serve as post physician at the clandestine interrogation facility that was Camp King. According to Schreiber’s declassified OMGUS security report, his new job involved “handling all the medical problems at Camp King [and] caring for internees.” This meant Schreiber was in charge of the health and well-being of the Soviet prisoners held here, some of whom were being subjected to “special interrogation methods” by the CIA. Given the army’s obsession with Soviet spies and the possibility of double agents, hiring a Nazi general turned Soviet starshina was an unusual choice when one considered the real possibility that Schreiber had not escaped from the Russians but was working for them. If Schreiber was a Soviet spy, it would have been very easy for him to learn everything that the CIA and military intelligence were doing at Camp King. On the other hand, if Schreiber really had escaped from the Russians, then there was a lot to be exploited from his Soviet experience. Having been a prisoner of the Russians for the past three and a half years, he was familiar with at least some of the Soviets’ interrogation techniques. He spoke Russian fluently as well. Lieutenant Colonel Ingraham was confident that Dr. Schreiber was a truthteller. Ingraham kept him on as post doctor until August 1951. Colonel Ingraham also hired Schreiber’s twenty-three-year-old daughter, Dorothea Schreiber, to serve as his personal secretary. While employed at Camp King, Schreiber told his Army handler that the Russians were trying to capture and kill him and he asked to use the cover name of “Doc Fischer,” to hide his identity. It was a cryptic choice for an alias. “Fisher” had been the name of the Soviet handler from whom Schreiber had allegedly escaped, in Dresden, and it was also the name of an SS doctor who served as one of Schreiber’s wartime subordinates at the Ravensbrück concentration camp. Dr. Fritz Fischer had performed medical experiments on Polish women and girls at Ravensbrück, crimes for which he had been tried and convicted of murder at the Nuremberg doctors’ trial. Fritz Fischer was one of the few doctors who had accepted his guilt over the course of the trial.

Fritz Fischer was one of the few doctors who had accepted his guilt over the course of the trial. After hearing some particularly shocking witness testimony against him, Dr. Fischer confided in war crimes investigator Dr. Alexander about how he felt. “I would have liked to stand up and say hang me immediately,” Fischer told Alexander. Looking at the whole scenario—Dr. Schreiber, Doc Fischer, the Soviet Mr. Fisher, and the SS doctor Fritz Fischer—was like seeing a man standing in a hall of mirrors. But then again Operation Paperclip was a world marked by duplicity and deception. It was impossible to know who was telling the truth. In September 1949, John J. McCloy became U.S. high commissioner of Allied Germany, marking the end of more than four years of military rule of Germany by the Allies. The day also marked the beginning of the end of the time Dr. Otto Ambros would spend in prison for war crimes. Soon he would be placed on the Operation Paperclip target list. Ambros, Hitler’s favorite chemist, had been incarcerated for roughly one year of an eight-year prison sentence. On July 30, 1948, Ambros had been convicted of mass murder and slavery in Case No. VI of the subsequent Nuremberg proceedings, the IG Farben trial, and sent to Landsberg Prison, also called War Criminal Prison No. 1. Located thirty-eight miles west of Munich, Landsberg was home to 1,526 convicted Nazi war criminals. The men were housed in a central prison barracks inside individual cells, but the facility itself was situated on a boarding school–like campus, with nineteenth-century buildings, leafy parks, and a grand, wood-paneled Catholic church. Adolf Hitler had been a prisoner here for eight months in 1924. Landsberg Prison was where Hitler wrote Mein Kampf. In prison Ambros taught “chemical technology” to other inmates as part of a prisoner education program. He penned letters to his mother expressing how unfair it all was. “Politic[s] is a bitter disease and it is grotesque that I, as a non-political person, should suffer for something I have not done,” he wrote. “But one day, all this suffering will cease and then it will not be long before I have forgotten all this bitterness.” Ambros’s nineteen-year-old son, Dieter Ambros, wrote clemency appeals on his father’s behalf. “My father is innocent as you know,” began one letter to Bishop Theophil Wurm, a Protestant leader who regularly advocated for the war criminals’ release. “Thank you for supporting our efforts… my father is [being] illegally held.” Ambros was a model prisoner. Otto Ambros had many lawyers", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:Operation Paperclip_cleaned.txt:243:d6cb41873165", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 6156, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "Operation Paperclip_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/031622104X", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "Operation Paperclip_cleaned", "chunk_index": 244, "text": "one day, all this suffering will cease and then it will not be long before I have forgotten all this bitterness.” Ambros’s nineteen-year-old son, Dieter Ambros, wrote clemency appeals on his father’s behalf. “My father is innocent as you know,” began one letter to Bishop Theophil Wurm, a Protestant leader who regularly advocated for the war criminals’ release. “Thank you for supporting our efforts… my father is [being] illegally held.” Ambros was a model prisoner. Otto Ambros had many lawyers working for him to secure an early release. He also wrote petitions himself, requesting small items. In 1948, he asked the prison board for an extra pillow, softer than the one provided. In 1949, he requested permission to keep his accordion in his cell. Each year, Ambros saw the Landsberg Prison doctor for a checkup. Convicted Nazi war criminal Dr. Oskar Schröder, former chief of the Medical Corps Services of the Luftwaffe, checked Ambros’s vitals and wrote up his annual health report. Schröder had been employed by the U.S. Army Air Forces at the Aero Medical Center in Heidelberg before the doctors’ trial and was now serving a life term at Landsberg. Also in the prison were Hermann Becker-Freyseng and Wilhelm Beiglböck, serving twenty and fifteen year sentences, respectively. The twelve subsequent war crimes trials at Nuremberg had ended just a few months prior to John J. McCloy’s becoming high commissioner of Germany. Most Americans had long since lost interest in following any of the trials. The majority of Germans disagreed with the whole war crimes trial premise, and many saw those convicted as having been singled out by American and British victors and given “victors’ justice” as punishment. At war’s end, U.S. occupation authorities had determined that 3.6 million Nazis in the American zone alone were “indictable” for political or war crimes. This enormous number was eventually whittled down to a more manageable 930,000 individuals, who were then processed through 169,282 denazification trials. More than 50,000 Germans had been convicted of various Nazi-era crimes, most in the Spruchkammern courts but also in Allied military tribunals. The majority of those convicted served some time in postwar detention camps or paid nominal fines. When McCloy took office, 806 Nazis had been sentenced to death and sent to Landsberg Prison, with 486 executions carried out to date. By the fall of 1949, the German press had begun referring to the convicted criminals held at Landsberg as the “so-called prisoners of war.” This was just one of the sensitive issues that Commissioner McCloy was faced with when he arrived. Another was Operation Paperclip. McCloy had been a champion of the Nazi scientist program from its very first days, back in the late spring of 1945, when he served as assistant secretary of war. He was also the chairman of the State-War-Navy Coordinating Committee at the time, which put him in charge of making", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:Operation Paperclip_cleaned.txt:244:345ff84161c0", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 6157, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "Operation Paperclip_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/031622104X", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "Operation Paperclip_cleaned", "chunk_index": 245, "text": "held at Landsberg as the “so-called prisoners of war.” This was just one of the sensitive issues that Commissioner McCloy was faced with when he arrived.

He was also the chairman of the State-War-Navy Coordinating Committee at the time, which put him in charge of making some of the first decisions regarding the fate of the program. McCloy was a statesman and a lawyer but he was also an economist. In between his tenure as assistant secretary of war and high commissioner of Germany, he was president of the World Bank. His service there came at a critical time in the bank’s early history. McCloy is credited in World Bank literature as “defining the relationship between the Bank and the United Nations and the Bank and the United States.” Now he was back in government service as a diplomat, having come to Germany to fill the shoes of General Lucius D. Clay, exiting OMGUS chief. John J. McCloy was a short, plump man, balding, with a banker’s bravado. When in public he almost always wore a crisp suit. As high commissioner he traveled around Germany in the private diesel train that had belonged to Adolf Hitler. While power had been officially transferred to a new West German civilian government, run by Chancellor Konrad Adenauer, McCloy remained in charge of many aspects of Germany’s law and order as West Germany transitioned into becoming its own sovereign nation once again. One area that Chancellor Adenauer had absolutely no jurisdiction over was the Landsberg prisoners. Several hundred of these convicted war criminals had already been hanged in the Landsberg courtyard. Eighty-six others faced death. When McCloy took office as high commissioner, the rhetoric around the Landsberg prisoners was at an all-time high. Many Germans wanted the prisoners released. In November of 1949, a group of German lawyers linked to the Farben industrialists, including Otto Ambros, requested a meeting with John J. McCloy at his office in the former IG Farben building, in Frankfurt. The IG Farben building had been taken over by the U.S. Army when troops entered Frankfurt in March of 1945 and had served as a home for the U.S. Army and various U.S. government organizations ever since. The massive complex—the largest office building in Europe until the 1950s —had panoramic views of Frankfurt, as well as parklands, a sports field, and a pond. In August 1949, OMGUS moved its headquarters from Berlin to Frankfurt, and shortly thereafter the U.S. high commissioner’s office headquarters were set up in the IG Farben complex. In September 1949, McCloy settled in. The CIA maintained an office in the IG Farben building throughout the Cold War.

In September 1949, McCloy settled in. The CIA maintained an office in the IG Farben building throughout the Cold War. It was located just a few floors and a few doors down from McCloy’s office. It was a precarious time for an American civilian to be governing occupied Germany. The Soviets had just detonated their first atomic bomb, years ahead of what had been predicted by the CIA. The U.S. military was on high alert, perhaps nowhere more so than in West Germany. During the November meeting in McCloy’s office at the IG Farben complex, German lawyers told McCloy that if West Germany and the United States were going to move forward together in a united front against the Communist threat, something had to be done about the men incarcerated at Landsberg. These prisoners were viewed unanimously by Germans as “political prisoners,” the lawyers said, and they told McCloy that he should grant all of them clemency. After the meeting, McCloy sent a memo to the legal department of the Allied High Commission, inquiring if “after sentences were imposed by military tribunal,” he, as U.S. high commissioner, had any authority to review the sentences. The legal department told him that as far as the Landsberg war criminals were concerned, he had the authority to do whatever he thought appropriate. In America, Telford Taylor, the former Nuremberg prosecutor general, caught wind of what was going on in the high commissioner’s office in Frankfurt and was outraged. He wrote to McCloy to remind him that the Nazi war criminals at Landsberg “are without any question among the most deliberate, shameless murderers of the entire Nuremberg List, and any idea of further clemency in their cases seems to me out of the question.” McCloy never responded, according to McCloy’s biographer, Kai Bird. McCloy established an official review board to examine the war criminals’ sentences—the Advisory Board on Clemency for War Criminals, known as the Peck Panel, after its chairman, David W. Peck. A powerful former Nazi lieutenant general, Hans Speidel, appealed personally to McCloy. Speidel was one of Chancellor Konrad Adenauer’s chief advisers on rearmament, a highly controversial subject but one being discussed nonetheless. Hans Speidel’s younger brother, Wilhelm Speidel, was a convicted war criminal at Landsberg. Speidel told McCloy’s adjunct in Bonn, “[If] the prisoners at Landsberg were hanged, Germany as an armed ally against the East was an illusion.” In a similarly bullish manner, Chancellor Konrad Adenauer told McCloy the same thing, advising him that he should grant “the widest possible clemency for persons sentenced to", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:Operation Paperclip_cleaned.txt:246:6322e2071f13", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 6159, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "Operation Paperclip_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/031622104X", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "Operation Paperclip_cleaned", "chunk_index": 247, "text": "Chancellor Konrad Adenauer’s chief advisers on rearmament, a highly controversial subject but one being discussed nonetheless.

The idea that the Communists were also about to invade Western Europe took hold in the Pentagon. On July 14, 1950, the commander at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base sent an urgent memo to Operation Paperclip’s in-house champion, Colonel Donald Putt: “Due to the threat of impending hostilities in Europe and the possibility that forces of the USSR may rapidly overrun the continent, this command is concerned with the problem of the immediate implementation of an evacuation program for German and Austrian scientists.” Were these scientists to “fall into enemy hands… they would constitute a threat to our national security.” Air force intelligence recommended to JIOA that it initiate a “mass procurement effort” in Germany. JIOA agreed and began making formal plans with the high commissioner’s office to effect this. The Korean War sparked a new fire under Operation Paperclip. Inside the high commissioner’s office, McCloy maintained a group called the Scientific Research Division that was specifically dedicated to the issue of German scientists. The head of the division was Dr. Carl Nordstrom, and ever since McCloy had taken office Nordstrom had been trying to expedite the procession of German scientists to America. Dr. Nordstrom maintained a thick file labeled “Allocation of German Scientists and Technicians” and had sent many eyes-only memos to McCloy in “support of certain research projects” he foresaw as valuable to national interest. Now, in light of the Korean War, Nordstrom got a new job from JIOA. He was assigned to be the German liaison to a new JIOA program being fasttracked out of the Pentagon, named Accelerated Paperclip but called Project 63 in the field: A number of Germans had soured on the name Paperclip. The premise of the Accelerated Paperclip program was to move “especially dangerous top level scientists” out of Germany in a “modified Denial Program” that needed to be kept away from the Soviets at all costs. The high commissioner’s office began working with army intelligence to “evacuate” 150 of these scientists, code-named the ^(𝔠𝔠)K^(𝔡) list, from Germany to the United States. A group of American officers called the Special Projects Team would be dispatched to recruit the ^(𝔠𝔠)K^(𝔡) list scientists.

A group of American officers called the Special Projects Team would be dispatched to recruit the ^(𝔠𝔠)K^(𝔡) list scientists. The Joint Chiefs of Staff approved a prodigious $1 million procurement budget to help entice these “especially dangerous top level scientists” to come to America, the equivalent of approximately $10 million in 2013. Accelerated Paperclip, or Project 63, meetings were held at the high commissioner’s offices in Wiesbaden and Frankfurt, with Dr. Carl Nordstrom keeping notes. Representatives from JIOA, the army, the air force, EUCOM, and the CIA attended. Because many on the ^(𝔠𝔠)K^(𝔡𝔰) list did not have a job offer already in place, the JIOA decided to set up a clandestine office in New York City, at the Alamac Hotel, where the scientists could live while they waited for assignments. The Accelerated Paperclip project director in America, Colonel William H. Speidel (no known relation to the Wilhelm Speidel war criminal at Landsberg Prison or his lawyer brother), maintained an office there. An entire block of rooms was set aside in the nineteen-story hotel, on Seventy-first Street and Broadway, for a yet-unnamed group of German scientists scheduled to arrive at a future date. A welcome brochure was printed up and kept on file at the high commissioner’s office. “To insure your comfort, convenience and interest in general,” it read, “a competent officer, assisted by a carefully selected staff… will serve your interests from the time of your arrival until the time of your departure to enter employment.” The officer “will maintain an office at the hotel in which you reside and be prepared to complete, or make provisions for, all arrangements incident to housing, restaurant facilities, securing medical services, and the administrative details of the project.” The U.S. Army’s “primary interest,” the scientists were told, “is in providing for your comfort, contentment, happiness and security [and] efforts will be directed to help you in attaining these goals with a minimum [of] friction, distraction, and delay.” German scientists who were approached. When JIOA requested an explanation from the high commissioner’s office as to why, Nordstrom reported that some on the ^(𝔠𝔠)K^(𝔡𝔰) list were simply “too old, too rich, too busy and too thoroughly disgruntled with past experiences with Americans,” to see a free room at the Alamac Hotel in New York City as a career move. Besides, Germany had its own chancellor now, and for the first time in five years, many German scientists saw that a prosperous scientific future was possible in their own country.

Others could not wait to come to America. With Accelerated Paperclip’s newest policy in place, Class I offenders could now be put on a JIOA list. This included Dr. Schreiber, still serving as post physician at Camp King. Another Class I offender was Dr. Kurt Blome, former deputy surgeon general of the Third Reich and Hitler’s biological weapons expert. The sword and the shield. In January of 1951, John J. McCloy’s office announced that he had come to a decision regarding the war criminals incarcerated at Landsberg Prison. The Peck Panel had finished its review process and recommended “substantial reductions of sentences” in the majority of cases involving lengthy prison terms. As for those who had been handed death sentences, the panel advised McCloy to consider each case individually. Also at issue was a financial matter. At Nuremberg, the judges had ordered the confiscation of property of convicted war criminals whose money was so often earned on the backs of slave laborers, tens of thousands of whom had been worked to death. Now, the Peck Panel suggested that this confiscation order be rescinded. For Otto Ambros, this would mean that he could keep what remained of the gift, from Adolf Hitler, of 1 million reichsmarks, a figure that has never been revealed before. McCloy spent several months considering the panel’s recommendations. During this time he was deluged with letters from religious groups and activists in Germany urging for the war criminals’ release. McCloy sent a cable from Frankfurt to Washington asking for counsel from the White House. The White House advised McCloy that the decision was his to make. John J. McCloy commuted ten of the fifteen death sentences. This meant that ten men condemned by International Military Tribunal judges—including the commander of the Malmédy Massacre, considered one of the war’s worst atrocities against prisoners of war, and several SS officers who had overseen the mobile killing units called Einsatzgruppen—would be released back into society within one and seven years. Among the death sentences McCloy chose to uphold were those of Otto Ohlendorf, commander of Einsatzgruppe D, responsible for ninety thousand deaths in Ukraine; Paul Blobel, commander of Einsatzgruppe C, responsible for thirty-three thousand deaths at Babi Yar, in Kiev; and Oswald Pohl, chief administrator of the concentration camps. McCloy also drastically reduced the sentences of sixty-four out of seventy-four remaining war criminals, which meant that one-third of the inmates tried at Nuremberg were freed.

On February 3, 1951, Otto Ambros traded in his red-striped denim prison uniform for the tailored suit he had arrived in. He walked out of the gates of Landsberg Prison a free man, his finances fully restored. “Doctors who had participated in the murder of patients continued to practice medicine, Nazi judges continued to preside over courtrooms, and former members of the SS, SD and Gestapo found positions in the intelligence services,” explains Andreas Nachama, curator of the Nazi Documentation Center in Berlin. “Even some leaders of the special mobile commandos (“Einsatzkommandos”) [paramilitary extermination squads] tried to pursue careers in the public service.” The following month, on March 27, 1951, Dr. Carl Nordstrom dispatched Charles McPherson, an officer with the Special Projects Team, to go locate and hire Dr. Kurt Blome. The Special Projects Team was now composed of a group of twenty agents, each with his own ^(𝔠𝔠)K^(𝔡) list of scientists to find. McPherson learned that Blome lived at 34 Kielstrasse, in Dortmund, and he traveled there to interview the doctor. During his first visit, Charles McPherson learned that Dr. Blome lived in the apartment adjacent to Blome’s private physician’s practice in Dortmund during the week. On weekends he returned to his home in Hagen, twelve miles away, to be with his family. “His English is excellent and no interpreter is necessary to carry on a conversation,” McPherson wrote in his report. The reason for the visit, McPherson told Dr. Blome, was to offer Blome a contract with Operation Paperclip. “He stated he would definitely be interested.” Dr. Blome requested more details. “He feels he is too old to begin a new type of work and would prefer to return to biological research or cancer research.” Blome alluded to the fact that he had already worked on Top Secret germ warfare research for the British, under Operation Matchbox, the British equivalent of Operation Paperclip. Blome said that the British had helped secure his house in Hagen for him. McPherson left Dortmund with the impression that the fifty-seven-year-old was “very interested but would need a definite offer before he could make up his mind.” Approximately three months later, on Thursday, June 21, 1951, McPherson again interviewed Dr. Blome. “I presented him with a copy of our contract form and informed him that we were willing to pay him about $6400 per year for the duration of the contract.” Blome had additional questions. He asked McPherson about the buying power of this salary and the amount of taxes he would", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:Operation Paperclip_cleaned.txt:250:ca8987f35e1f", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 6163, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "Operation Paperclip_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/031622104X", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "Operation Paperclip_cleaned", "chunk_index": 251, "text": "“very interested but would need a definite offer before he could make up his mind.” Approximately three months later, on Thursday, June 21, 1951, McPherson again interviewed Dr. Blome. “I presented him with a copy of our contract form and informed him that we were willing to pay him about $6400 per year for the duration of the contract.” Blome had additional questions. He asked McPherson about the buying power of this salary and the amount of taxes he would have to pay. “He then had another request which I informed him that I could do nothing about,” McPherson wrote. Blome said he had “some money which was tied up in a professional account because it had been determined that these are funds of the Nazi Party.” Blome asked McPherson for his help in trying to release the money back to him, and to look into “the possibilities of transferring [the money] from Marks into Dollars,” in order to bring it to the United States. McPherson explained, “I informed him that there was no legal means at present of doing this but that this could be transacted through Switzerland.” Blome said he needed some time to read over the contract and to discuss the matter with his wife. He said he’d get in touch with McPherson in about two weeks. In August it was official: “Professor Kurt Blome was contracted under Project 63 on 21 August. Will be ready for shipment 15 November,” McPherson wrote. The Blomes took their boys out of school and began teaching them English. Dr. Blome turned his practice over to another doctor in Dortmund. The couple traveled to the Berlin Document Center and provided sworn testimony regarding their Nazi past. The documents were reviewed by McCloy’s office. Per Accelerated Paperclip, a key document that would be used for a visa application, the Revised Security Report on German (or Austrian) Scientist or Important Technician, was drawn up. The single most important element governing justification of Accelerated Paperclip/Project 63 was now stated on page one: “Based on available records… Subjects have not been in the past and are not at the present time members of the Communist Party.” The issue of being an ardent Nazi had lost first position and was relegated down to section six. There, the issue of Blome’s Nazi Party record was addressed: “Kurt Blome entered the Party on 1 July 1931 with Party number 590233. He is also listed as a member of the SA since 1941 and is a holder of the Golden Party Badge since 1943. His wife, Dr. Bettina Blome, entered the Party on 1 April 1940 with Party number 8,257,157.” It was also noted, “The 66th CIC Central Registry contains a Secret dossier on Dr. Kurt Blome.” Those details were separately classified. “Based on available records, Subjects were not war criminals but undoubtedly were ardent Nazis,” wrote Lieutenant Colonel", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:Operation Paperclip_cleaned.txt:251:54a88828adf3", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 6164, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "Operation Paperclip_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/031622104X", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "Operation Paperclip_cleaned", "chunk_index": 252, "text": "number 590233.

Smith, an authorized representative of John J. McCloy. Blome was a Nazi ideologue and Smith stated so. He also wrote that Blome was not likely to become a security threat. “It is the opinion of the United States High Commissioner for Germany that they are not likely to become security threats to the United States.” The report was signed and dated September 27, 1951. Two weeks later, on October 10, 1951, Blome’s secret Accelerated Paperclip contract was approved. But on October 4, 1951, the chief of Army Intelligence, G-2, a colonel by the name of Garrison B. Coverdale, read the high commissioner’s security report on Dr. Blome and rejected Blome’s admission to Operation Paperclip. McCloy’s representative, Lieutenant Colonel Harry R. Smith, had failed to do the most important thing necessary when it came to drawing up a Paperclip contract: to lie by omission about Nazi party loyalty. All kinds of phrases could be used to allow the State Department to turn a blind eye to its legal obligation to keep Nazis out of the United States. Most OMGUS security officers knew to write “not a security threat” or “merely an opportunist” in the space that asked about the scientist’s Nazi Party record. After reading the report, Colonel Garrison B. Coverdale sent a confidential cable to the director of JIOA in Washington, stating, “Attention is invited to paragraph 6 of subject report.” In stating the truth, Lieutenant Colonel Harry R. Smith made it impossible for Dr. Blome’s Paperclip contract to be approved. McPherson would not readily accept this setback. “Blome contract signed and approved Commander in Chief. Subject completing preparations for shipment late November. Has already turned over private practice Dortmund to another doctor. In view of adverse publicity which might ensue and which may destroy entire program this theatre recommend[s] subject be shipped for completion 6 months portion contract,” he wrote. The case was sent to the consulate for an opinion. On October 24, 1951, the consulate in Frankfurt agreed with army intelligence: “Frankfurt Consul states Blome inadmissible.” Charles McPherson saw Blome’s rejection as calamitous. It interfered with the core mission of the Special Projects Team and jeopardized the success of the entire Accelerated Paperclip program, he believed. “Recommend Blome be shipped and ostensibly occupied on inconsequential activities in the United States for 6 months,” McPherson suggested. But that idea was rejected, too. Blome was no fool.

But that idea was rejected, too. Blome was no fool. This was a man who skillfully argued at Nuremberg that intent was not a crime and was acquitted on these grounds. Now, at the Burgtor Hotel, Blome made clear to McPherson that he did not believe McPherson’s lies. Blome had recently been in communication with his colleague and former professor Pasqual Jordan and was entirely aware that Jordan was actively being prepared for Accelerated Paperclip work. Blome told McPherson that he had recently been in contact with one of his deputies in biological warfare research, the rinderpest expert Professor Erich Traub. Blome told McPherson that he was well aware that Traub had recently gone to America “under the auspices of the Paperclip Project.” Blome was particularly upset because Traub had worked under him during the war. McPherson tried to placate Dr. Blome. “I then said that we were still ready to put his contract in effect and that we had a position for him at a military post in Frankfurt, probably as a post doctor.” McPherson suggested that Blome come have a look at the facility, that it was a pleasant place and offered a well-paying job. “He and his wife agreed,” McPherson wrote in his report. Still, McPherson saw the situation with Dr. Blome as potentially disastrous. “The undersigned wishes to point out that he did not tell the Blomes that their opportunity to go to the United States is apparently nil and apparently will remain that way, but took the slant that our shipments have been suspended for an indefinite duration. This will leave the way open in the event something can be done.” McPherson worried that the Blome affair was going to have an unfavorable effect “upon our project not only by the immediate individuals concerned but by the chain reaction produced by one individual telling the other that the Americans have broken their word.” McPherson was actively recruiting other German scientists at the same time. He believed that he had a handle on how the scientists communicated among themselves. “The professional class of Germany is tightly enough knit so that this word will be widely disseminated and the future effectiveness of our program will be greatly curtailed.” McPherson was wrong. Not all the former Nazis in the “professional class” talked among themselves. Dr. Blome was not aware that the reason a job offer as a military post doctor near Frankfurt was available to him was because the", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:Operation Paperclip_cleaned.txt:253:394c4d50312d", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 6166, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "Operation Paperclip_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/031622104X", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "Operation Paperclip_cleaned", "chunk_index": 254, "text": "that he had a handle on how the scientists communicated among themselves. “The professional class of Germany is tightly enough knit so that this word will be widely disseminated and the future effectiveness of our program will be greatly curtailed.” McPherson was wrong. Not all the former Nazis in the “professional class” talked among themselves. Dr. Blome was not aware that the reason a job offer as a military post doctor near Frankfurt was available to him was because the previous post doctor, also a former high-ranking Nazi in the Reich’s medical chain of command, had just been shipped to America under Accelerated Paperclip. There was irony in the fact that the shoes Dr. Blome was about to fill had, for the past two years and four months, belonged to Major General Dr. Walter Schreiber, the man who had betrayed Dr. Blome in his testimony during the trial of the major war criminals at Nuremberg. The army post outside Frankfurt where Blome would soon start working was Camp King. McPherson made arrangements with its new commanding officer, Colonel Howard Rupert, to meet the Blomes and arrange for them to have a nice house. Blome had been to Camp King before. He had worked for the U.S. government there on a “special matter” during the Reinhard Gehlen era. When Dr. Blome’s wife, Bettina, learned more about Camp King, she declined the invitation to live there. She was not interested in having her children live at an American military facility. The couple separated. Dr. Kurt Blome moved to Camp King alone. On Meanwhile, halfway across the world, in the suburbs of San Antonio, Texas, Camp King’s former post physician, Major General Dr. Walter Schreiber, had arrived in the United States and was working at the School of Aviation Medicine at Randolph Air Force Base (formerly Randolph Field). In addition to his U.S. government salary, Schreiber had recently received a check from the U.S. government in the amount of $16, 000 —roughly $150, 000 in 2013—as a settlement for the alleged lost contents of his former Berlin home. (Schreiber claimed that the Russians had stolen all his property in retaliation for his working for the Americans.) With the money, Schreiber bought a home in San Antonio and a car, and he enrolled his son in the local high school. Even Schreiber’s eighty-fouryear-old mother-in-law had been brought along to live in Texas, courtesy of the United States Air Force. It could be said that Dr. Schreiber was living the American dream. But in the fall of 1951 the dream was unexpectedly interrupted by a former war crimes investigator named Dr. Leopold Alexander, and a concentration camp survivor named Janina Iwanska. In the fall of 1951, Dr. Leopold Alexander’s life in Boston had returned to normal.

But in the fall of 1951 the dream was unexpectedly interrupted by a former war crimes investigator named Dr. Leopold Alexander, and a concentration camp survivor named Janina Iwanska. In the fall of 1951, Dr. Leopold Alexander’s life in Boston had returned to normal. It had been four years since he had served as an expert consultant to the secretary of war during the Nuremberg doctors’ trial. Since returning home, Dr. Alexander continued to speak out against medical crimes, nonconsenting human experiments, and medicine under totalitarian regimes. He coauthored the Nuremberg Code, the set of research principles that now guided physicians around the world. The first principle of the Nuremberg Code was that informed voluntary consent was required in absolute terms. Dr. Alexander gave lectures, wrote papers, and practiced medicine. The doctors’ trial had affected him deeply, as evidenced in nearly five hundred pages of journal entries. Whenever the occasion arose, he provided pro bono service to victims of the Nazi regime. One day in the fall of 1951, Dr. Alexander was contacted by an aid group called the International Rescue Office. The group was organizing medical assistance for several concentration camp survivors who had been experimented on by Nazi doctors during the war and asked if Dr. Alexander could help. Dr. Alexander in turn contacted his friend and colleague at Beth Israel Hospital in Boston, chief surgeon Dr. Jacob Fine, and the two men helped arrange for the camp survivors to come to Massachusetts for medical treatment. One of the women was twenty-seven-year-old Janina Iwanska, a former prisoner at the Ravensbrück concentration camp. On November 14, 1951, Iwanska arrived at the Port of New York aboard a Greek ocean liner, the SS Neptunia. At the doctors’ trial, Janina Iwanska had delivered much of her testimony with Dr. Alexander standing beside her, pointing to her injuries and providing the judges with a professional medical analysis of what had been done to her by Nazi doctors during the war. Iwanska’s testimony was generally regarded as among the most powerful evidence presented at the trial. At Ravensbrück she had had her legs broken by Waffen-SS surgeon Dr. Karl Gebhardt and pieces of her shinbones removed. Dr. Gebhardt then ordered that Iwanska’s surgical wounds be deliberately infected with bacteria to cause gangrene, so he could treat them with sulfa drugs to see if the drugs worked. It was nothing short of a miracle that Janina Iwanska survived. Now, nine years later, she continued to suffer great physical pain. She walked with a limp because of the decimation of her shinbones. The purpose of the trip to the United States was to allow Iwanska to undergo surgery, at Beth Israel Hospital in Boston, to help alleviate this pain.

Dr. Gebhardt had been Major General Dr. Schreiber’s direct subordinate at Ravensbrück. Gebhardt had been one of the twenty-three defendants tried at the doctors’ trial. He was convicted, sentenced to death, and hanged in the courtyard at Landsberg Prison in June, 1948. Dr. Schreiber was working for the U.S. Air Force in Texas. The same month that Janina Iwanska arrived in the United States, a brief note appeared in medical journal stating that a doctor from Germany named Walter Schreiber had just joined the staff of the U.S. Air Force School of Aviation Medicine in Texas. As circumstance would have it, Dr. Leopold Alexander was a regular reader of this journal. When he came across Schreiber’s name— familiar as he was with Dr. Schreiber’s testimony at the Nuremberg trial of the major war criminals —Alexander was appalled. He wrote to the director of the Massachusetts Medical Society at once. “I regard it as my duty to inform you that the record shows that Dr. Schreiber is a thoroughly undesirable addition to American Medicine—in fact, an intolerable one,” Alexander explained. “He has been involved as an accessory before and after the fact in the worst of the Medical War Crimes which were carried out by the Nazi Government during the war, and was a key person in perverting the ethical standards of the members of the medical profession in Germany during the war.” Dr. Alexander demanded that Dr. Walter Schreiber be barred from practicing medicine in the United States. When he did not get the response he’d expected, he took the matter to the Boston Globe. It was shortly after 10:30 p.m. on December 8, 1951, in San Antonio, Texas, when Dr. Walter Schreiber heard the telephone ring. He had been in America for three months, and it was an unusual hour for him to receive a phone call. It was not as if Dr. Schreiber was a hospital physician on call waiting to hear about a sick patient. In his capacity as a research doctor at Randolph Air Force Base, he spent most of his time lecturing about classified matters to a small group of other doctors. Sometimes, he boasted to other doctors about how his area of expertise was extremely rare. He would tell colleagues that he was particularly valuable to the U.S. military because his knowledge was so esoteric.

Dr. Schreiber knew everything there was to know about winter warfare and desert warfare. About hygiene and vaccines and bubonic plague. At the officers’ club at the School of Aviation Medicine, where he gave lectures, he could be loud and boastful, delivering a highly sanitized version of his colorful life. He enjoyed telling long-winded stories about himself: how he had been a prisoner of the Soviets after the fall of Berlin; how he’d spent years in the notorious Lubyanka prison, in Moscow; how he’d doctored Field Marshal Paulus in a Russian safe house when Paulus got sick. But what Dr. Schreiber never discussed with anyone at Randolph Air Force Base was what he did before the fall of Berlin—from 1933 to 1945. The following morning, the Boston Globe published an explosive story with an eye-catching headline: “Ex-Nazi High Post with United States Air Force, says Medical Man Here.” News reached Texas quickly. Dr. Schreiber was called into the Office of Special Investigations (OSI) at Randolph Air Force Base to provide details of the phone call with Mr. Brown the previous evening. Schreiber confirmed that “during World War II he had held a position in the Wermacht [sic] similar to the Surgeon General of the U.S. Army.” But his story, his struggle, he told the investigating officer, was so much more than that. Schreiber relayed his capture in Berlin, his life as a prisoner of war in Soviet Russia, and how he’d “served as a prosecution witness during the Nuremberg War Crimes Trials.” Schreiber explained that owing to “feigned compliance” with the Russians he’d been “awarded a high position with the East German Politzei [sic].” Instead of taking that job he’d escaped. Schreiber lied to the Office of Special Investigations and said that he had met Dr. Leo Alexander at Nuremberg. That he had been “given a clean bill of health by [Doctor] Alexander” himself. Schreiber told the air force investigator he was certain that the Russians were behind all of this. He had recently written a manuscript called “Behind the Iron Curtain,” Schreiber said, and while he hadn’t found a publisher yet, he believed that the Russians had gotten hold of a copy of it. “He was of the opinion that [Soviet Intelligence] is perhaps attempting to slander him by implying that he was engaged in atrocious experiments on human subjects,” the investigating officer wrote in his report. Schreiber’s full statement was forwarded to air force headquarters.

Schreiber’s full statement was forwarded to air force headquarters. The security officers at Randolph Air Force Base did not have the kind of clearance that allowed them access to Dr. Schreiber’s JIOA file or his OMGUS security report. They had no idea who Schreiber really was. They most certainly had not been made aware that he was a Nazi ideologue and the former surgeon general of the Third Reich. All anyone at the School of Aviation Medicine would have known was that he was a German scientist who was part of Operation Paperclip. The facility had already employed thirty-four German scientists. On December 14, the FBI got involved in the case. Dr. Leopold Alexander, Schreiber’s accuser in Boston, was an internationally renowned authority on medical crimes. His allegations had to be taken seriously. But the air force was unwilling to give up Dr. Schreiber right away. To garner support for him, a memo classified Secret was circulated among those involved, heralding the “Professional and Personal Qualifications of Dr. Walter Schreiber.” The memo stated, “He possesses an analytical mind, critical judgment, objectivity, and a wealth of well detailed, exact information.” Schreiber possessed “know how on preventative health measures, military and civilian, under conditions of total war.” He had “detailed information of medical problems in connection with desert and ‘Arctic’ warfare,” and had “contributed to Zeiss Atlas of Epidemology” [sic]. He’d been “a ‘key’ prisoner of war in Russia for three and a half years [and] he is in a position to provide authoritative information and serve as a consultant on vitally important medical matters in Russia.” With public outrage brewing over the Globe article, the situation escalated quickly. The Pentagon became involved, and the matter was sent to the office of the surgeon general of the United States Air Force. That position was now held by none other than Harry Armstrong, recently promoted to major general. Armstrong knew the situation could very quickly get out of control. And hardly anyone had more to lose, personally and professionally, than he did. With the assistance of Dr. Hubertus Strughold, Harry Armstrong had personally recruited fifty-eight former Nazi doctors for work at the U.S. Army Air Forces Aero Medical Center in Heidelberg, five of whom had been arrested for war crimes, four of whom were tried at Nuremberg, two of whom were convicted at Nuremberg, and one of whom was acquitted and then rehired by the U.S. Air Force to work in America before being revealed as incompetent and fired.

That said nothing of the thirty-four doctors who had since been hired to work at the School of Aviation Medicine, many of whom were Nazi ideologues as well as former members of the SS and the SA. The Schreiber scandal could trigger a domino effect, shining an unwanted spotlight on the highly suspicious backgrounds of Dr. Strughold, Dr. Benzinger, Dr. Konrad Schäfer, Dr. Becker-Freyseng, Dr. Schröder, Dr. Ruff, and so many others. Major General Harry Armstrong wrote to the director of intelligence of the air force regarding Major General Dr. Schreiber. “I have been advised by the Commandant, USAF School of Aviation Medicine, Randolph Air Force Base, Texas, that they recently forwarded to your office a request for a new contract [for] Doctor Walter Schreiber until June 1952,” Armstrong wrote. “Recent information indicated that Doctor Schreiber may have been implicated in the medical war crimes in Germany during World War II, and his presence in this country has aroused a considerable amount of criticism. As a consequence of this, it is the firm opinion of this office that the Air Force Medical Service cannot associate itself with Doctor Schreiber beyond the six months’ contract under which he is now employed.” Further, said Armstrong, “it may be advisable to terminate this contract even prior to its expiration.” Armstrong promised that the commandant of the School of Aviation Medicine, Major General Otis Benson, “concurs with this recommendation.” General Benson had equal reason to want the Schreiber scandal to quietly disappear. After the war, Benson had served as technical supervisor of the German scientists working at the Army Air Forces Aero Medical Center in Heidelberg. Two weeks after the scandal broke, Dr. Schreiber was informed that his contract would not be renewed. General Benson delivered the news in person. According to Schreiber, Benson also proposed a secret, alternative plan involving Schreiber’s future career in America. In an affidavit, Schreiber swore that General Benson “stated that he felt sure my services could be utilized in other branches of the government or in medical schools, and offered his assistance in soliciting for a position for me.” In Boston, the matter continued to generate press.

The Janina Iwanska story was news people were interested in reading about. Despite what had been done to her during the war, Janina Iwanska was a vibrant, beautiful, credible young woman; it was almost impossible not to marvel at her resilience. After being liberated from Ravensbrück, she had moved to Paris, where she had been working as a journalist for Radio Free Europe. She also worked as the Paris-based correspondent for several Polish newspapers in Western Europe. When Iwanska was experimented on at Ravensbrück she was only seventeen years old. While imprisoned there, she and several other female prisoners had taken remarkable steps to get word outside the camp about what was being done by Nazi doctors at Ravensbrück. With the goal of getting their message to the Vatican, the BBC, and the International Red Cross, Iwanska and four other women sent secret messages to their relatives outside the camp. Remarkably, a French prisoner named Germaine Tillion took photographs of the women’s wounds, then smuggled a roll of film out of the camp. The story was printed in the Polish underground press during the war, notifying the world about the Ravensbrück medical experiments. The story was eventually picked up by the BBC, as the women had hoped. “Three weeks ago, the journalist was coming from the Boston Post [sic] and they showed me about fifty (50) pictures and they asked me if I know [which one] is Dr. Schreiber,” Iwanska said. She described how she had no trouble picking Schreiber’s photograph out of fifty presented to her. “I saw this face in the doctors’ group in Ravensbrück,” she said. “After, they asked me if I knew Schreiber’s name. I told them, ‘I know Schreiber’s name.’” Dr. Schreiber, in a separate interview, claimed that he had had nothing to do with the Ravensbrück experiments, that he had never even visited a concentration camp, and that he had never met Janina Iwanska, who was accusing him of outrageous acts. In response, Janina Iwanska had this to say: “I had an operation done on my legs by Dr. Gebhart [sic].… During the first dressing after the operations I spoke to him. I asked Dr. Gebhart why they did the operation and they gave the answer, ‘We can do the experiment because you are condemned to die.’ The number [tattooed on] my legs are T. K. M. III. If Dr. Schreiber cannot remember my name, I am sure perhaps he can remember the experiment [number].” “I will be able to get a visa for you all within fourteen days,” promised Schreiber’s daughter. “To be honest, we always have feared something similar to come.… Everything started so well and seemed", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:Operation Paperclip_cleaned.txt:260:5cfea6297432", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 6173, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "Operation Paperclip_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/031622104X", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "Operation Paperclip_cleaned", "chunk_index": 261, "text": "the operation and they gave the answer, ‘We can do the experiment because you are condemned to die.’ The number [tattooed on] my legs are T.

Your nice house, your new furniture.…” She assured her father that she could help get the paperwork necessary to enter Argentina. “If, father, you wish us to take steps, send us the necessary documents,” Elisabeth wrote. “Anyhow the risk would be much less than if you must go to Germany. For Heaven’s sake do not go back.” By mid-January, the JIOA weighed in. The Joint Chiefs decided that it was necessary to repatriate Dr. Schreiber. “Reason for Requesting Repatriation: Dr. Schreiber is basically not a research scientist, and as such his usefulness is very limited to the School of Aviation Medicine,” a memo read. “Recent criticism and adverse publicity [have] been directed against the School of Aviation Medicine in that it has been charged that Dr. Schreiber, as a high ranking Nazi Medical Officer, was connected with brutal experiments on concentration camp victims. The School of Aviation Medicine and the Surgeon General do not wish to assume responsibility for Schreiber… in view of the above criticism.” Army headquarters in Heidelberg, Germany, disagreed. On February 5, 1952, the army cabled a message marked “Secret” to JIOA, written in shorthand. “Recommend take act[ion] to retain Schreiber in US. Subj has invaluable info of intelligence nature regarding Russia and is outstanding [in] his professional field.” The Office of the U.S. High Commissioner weighed in: “All reparations of paper clip personnel unless voluntary have some adverse effect [on] JIOA programs,” a memo stated. “Request coordinate with G2 Army prior to final decision on repatriation.” At air force headquarters, another idea was gaining support. Why not help Dr. Schreiber “move” to Argentina? To this end, a major named D. A. Roe, from Army Intelligence, G-2, contacted Argentinean General Aristobulo Fidel Reyes to discuss “the utilization of the services of Dr. Walter Paul Schreiber, M.D.” Major Roe queried if “in any way possible… his talents could be used in Argentina.” The army had originally intended to allow the talented Dr. Schreiber to immigrate to the United States, Major Roe explained, but, unfortunately, that had changed. “His admissibility, under current law, as an immigrate [sic] of the U.S. is questionable because of this close affiliation with the Nazi Army,” Major Roe clarified. Argentina did not have the same kinds of immigration laws prohibiting entry of former high-ranking Nazis. It would be great if they could help.

Argentina did not have the same kinds of immigration laws prohibiting entry of former high-ranking Nazis. It would be great if they could help. Faced with pushback from High Commissioner John J. McCloy, JIOA retooled its repatriation position and instead made a case for extending Dr. Schreiber’s stay. “Schreiber family may be subjected to reprisals due to his previously reported escape from Russian control,” JIOA wrote. “If repatriation is inadvisable believe Schreiber may be retained here by issuance of visa. Above is additional reason for desirability of entry with immigration visa.” But then a new document emerged, marked JIOA eyes only, and to be kept in Schreiber’s classified dossier. Schreiber’s wife of forty years, Olga, was also an old-time Nazi. According to official NSDAP paperwork, she had joined the Nazi Party on October 1, 1931, years before Hitler came to power. The Physicians Forum, a group of doctors representing thirty-six states, wrote to the Senate. “Had Dr. Schreiber been found and apprehended at the time of the Nuremberg Military Tribunal,” the doctors wrote, “it is virtually certain that he would have been brought to trial along with his associates many of whom were sentenced to life imprisonment or hanged for their crimes. Instead this individual is now in the United States working for our Air Force.” The physicians unanimously recommended “[i]mmediate expulsion of Dr. Schreiber from the United States [and] a thorough investigation of the circumstances leading to Dr. Schreiber’s entry into this country and his assignment to the Air Force.” The final demand was far more threatening to the air force than the Physicians Forum doctors could have known. Were the Senate to hold hearings to investigate “similar appointments of German physicians formerly in important positions in the German armed forces during World War II,” the whole Paperclip program could be revealed. Heads would roll. Schreiber’s story could travel all the way up to the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the scandal all the way to the president of the United States. “I am not fighting for a renewal of my contract,” Schreiber told the Washington Post, “I am fighting for justice, and I will continue to do so as long as I live.” He issued an egregiously false statement, declaring, “I never was a member of the staff of the supreme command of the Wehrmacht.” In another interview, he said, “I never worked in a concentration camp.” Later in the interview he clarified that he had actually “visited” a camp once, in eastern Pomerania, without knowing it was a concentration camp. His very brief job there was to inspect “a report", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:Operation Paperclip_cleaned.txt:262:8ebd756ac4e6", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 6175, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "Operation Paperclip_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/031622104X", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "Operation Paperclip_cleaned", "chunk_index": 263, "text": "and I will continue to do so as long as I live.” He issued an egregiously false statement, declaring, “I never was a member of the staff of the supreme command of the Wehrmacht.” In another interview, he said, “I never worked in a concentration camp.” Later in the interview he clarified that he had actually “visited” a camp once, in eastern Pomerania, without knowing it was a concentration camp. His very brief job there was to inspect “a report for the delousing treatment,” for a group of girls whose “linen was disinfected with DDT,” Schreiber said. “After I arrived there, four days later, the girls were found clean and free of lice,” Schreiber said. Dr. Schreiber had the air force and the Joint Chiefs of Staff over a barrel, and he likely knew it. If any one of these high-ranking U.S. government officials was forced to admit what was really known about Schreiber—what had been known all along—it would be a scandal of the first degree. Instead, the lie was allowed to expand. “Until we come up with some basic facts,” JIOA director Colonel Benjamin W. Heckemeyer told Time magazine, in an exclusive sit-down interview with a reporter named Miss Moran, “a man should be given the all-American treatment here and not be given the bum’s rush.” Behind the scenes, Harry Armstrong, surgeon general of the air force, had been spearheading Schreiber’s removal. But in statements to the press, he maintained a façade of support. There is “no evidence he’s guilty other than serving his country during war same as I did mine,” General Armstrong told the Associated Press. Legendary newspaper columnist Drew Pearson did not see things in the same light. He pulled transcripts from the Nuremberg doctors’ trial and quoted from them in “Washington Merry-Go-Round.” “Here are the facts regarding the Nazi doctor who escaped the Nuremberg war crimes trials and is now working for the Air Force at Randolph Field, Texas,” Pearson wrote, “kicking, screaming young Polish girls were held down by SS troops and forcibly operated on.… Nuremberg document No. 619 also shows that Schreiber was second on a list of prominent medical officers detached to the SS for two days.… Human victims were also used in typhus experiments at Buchenwald and Natzweiler concentration camps. Deadly virus was transferred from men to mice and back in an attempt to produce live vaccine.” Schreiber responded by saying, “The Nuremberg Military Tribunal has prosecuted and held those responsible for the crimes.” That statement further incensed Dr. Leo Alexander and Boston attorney Alexander Hardy, the former chief prosecutor at the doctors’ trial. The two men drafted a ten-page letter to President Truman. “He was not a defendant [but] beyond a doubt he is responsible for medical crimes,” Hardy and Alexander explained. “He certainly had full knowledge that concentration camp inmates were being systematically experimented on by doctors of", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:Operation Paperclip_cleaned.txt:263:4023e3b8afa3", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 6176, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "Operation Paperclip_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/031622104X", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "Operation Paperclip_cleaned", "chunk_index": 264, "text": "saying, “The Nuremberg Military Tribunal has prosecuted and held those responsible for the crimes.” That statement further incensed Dr. Leo Alexander and Boston attorney Alexander Hardy, the former chief prosecutor at the doctors’ trial.

Included were details of yellow fever experiments, epidemic jaundice experiments, sulfanilamide experiments, euthanasia by phenol experiments and the notorious typhus vaccine program “with its 90% death rate.” Alexander Hardy and Dr. Alexander’s letter to President Truman portrayed Major General Dr. Walter Schreiber not only as a war criminal of the worst order but as a sadist and a liar. Parts of the letter were made public. “Truman Is Urged to Expel Physician,” read a headline in the New York Times. Harry Armstrong wrote to the Physicians Forum assuring them that Schreiber would be returned to Germany at once. JIOA director Colonel Heckemeyer was asked by Time magazine what the air force was going to do if, after completing its investigation, it found Dr. Schreiber guilty of war crimes. “That I will have to get guidance from the Office of the Secretary of Defense on,” Heckemeyer said. Could Schreiber be prosecuted, the Time reporter asked? “We are not going to make a Nuernberg [sic] trial three years after the trials are closed,” Heckemeyer said. Finally, the secretary of the air force, Thomas Finletter, made a public announcement stating that Dr. Schreiber would be dropped from his contract and put under military custody. He would leave the United States at once. But Dr. Schreiber refused to leave the United States. Instead, he packed up his family, left Texas, and drove to San Francisco. There, the Schreibers moved in with Dorothea, the couple’s married daughter, and her husband, William Fry, in their home at 35 Ridge Road, in San Anselmo. Just as Dorothea had worked at Camp King when her father was post surgeon there, her new husband, William Fry, had served at Camp King, as an army intelligence investigator. Having moved to America in July 1951, the two had lived in California since. More than a month passed. The Physicians Forum received new information about Schreiber, which they submitted to President Truman on April 24, 1952, along with a telegram marked “Urgent.” They", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:Operation Paperclip_cleaned.txt:264:4d9055a765fb", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 6177, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "Operation Paperclip_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/031622104X", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "Operation Paperclip_cleaned", "chunk_index": 265, "text": "35 Ridge Road, in San Anselmo.

The Physicians Forum received new information about Schreiber, which they submitted to President Truman on April 24, 1952, along with a telegram marked “Urgent.” They attached a document that showed that Brigadier General Otis Benson, commanding general at Randolph Field School of Aviation Medicine, “sought continued employment for Dr. Schreiber in the United States, preferably a ‘University Appointment,’” after the air force had already promised that Schreiber would soon be leaving the United States. The outrageous part, said the physicians, was that the U.S. Air Force was colluding to keep Schreiber in the United States. In their letter to President Truman, they quoted General Benson from a letter he’d written to the dean of the Minnesota School of Public Health, seeking a new job for Schreiber in the private sector. “I like and respect the man [but] he is too hot for me to keep here using public funds,” General Benson said of Schreiber. He said that the bad press had been little more than “an organized medical movement against him emanating from Boston by medical men of Jewish ancestry.” The Physicians Forum’s board of directors demanded that President Truman order the attorney general to open an investigation into the case. A few days later, a lieutenant colonel named G. A. Little, representing the Joint Chiefs of Staff, flew to California to visit with Dr. Schreiber at his daughter’s house, “for the purpose of attempting to persuade Dr. Schreiber to go to Buenos Aires at once, regardless of job opportunities which might or might not be developed through [our] office.” According to Little, the visit went well. “We were very cordially received by Dr. Schreiber and spent approximately two hours in conversation with him,” Lieutenant Colonel G. A. Little wrote in a confidential report for the Joint Chiefs of Staff. In exchange for “transportation to South America” and “funds for travel,” and “travel allowance for Schreiber Family Group,” Dr. Schreiber agreed to leave the United States at once. “Schreiber’s voluntary and immediate departure for Buenos Aires will provide a satisfactory solution for all concerned.” The amount Schreiber was paid to leave was never disclosed and is not mentioned in his declassified Operation Paperclip file. On May 22, 1952, Dr. Schreiber and his family were flown by military aircraft from Travis Air Force Base, in California, to New Orleans, Louisiana. There, they boarded a ship bound for Argentina. When they arrived in Buenos Aires, they were taken by car to the American consulate and given documents that allowed them to stay.

When they arrived in Buenos Aires, they were taken by car to the American consulate and given documents that allowed them to stay. The arrangements were made by General Aristobulo Fidel Reyes. The air force paid for police protection for Dr. Schreiber and his family during the transition. It was important that the Schreibers’ resettlement in South America go smoothly. There were too many American officials whose reputations would never survive if the facts were revealed. The Senate hearings never happened, and the attorney general never opened a case. In Argentina, Dr. Schreiber bought a home and named it Sans Souci (“without a care”), the name of the summer palace in Potsdam, outside Berlin, of Frederick the Great, king of Prussia. According to personal family documents, Schreiber’s final quest was to prove that he had been born a baron and was descended from Prussian royalty. “As a consequence of what the official investigation turned up, in addition to his own extraordinary meritorious achievements,” say the family documents, “Oberstabsarzt [Military Medical Doctor] Walter P. Schreiber was given ‘official’ permission to add ‘von’ to his name.” The personal papers do not say who gave this official permission. Schreiber died in September 1970 in San Carlos de Bariloche, Río Negro, Argentina. As Dr. Schreiber sailed for Argentina, the Operation Bluebird interrogation program at Camp King expanded to include “the use of drugs and chemicals in unconventional interrogation.” Dr. Kurt Blome was Camp King’s post doctor during this period. According to a memo in his declassified foreign scientist case file, Blome worked on “Army, 1952, Project 1975,” a Top Secret project that itself has never been declassified. Blome’s file becomes empty after that. “Bluebird was rechristened Artichoke,” writes John Marks, a former State Department official and authority on the CIA’s mind control programs. The goal of the Artichoke interrogation program, Marks explains, was “modifying behavior through covert means.” According to the program’s administrator, Richard Helms—the future director of the CIA—using drugs was a means to that end. “We felt that it was our responsibility not to lag behind the Russians or the Chinese in this field, and the only way to find out what the risks were was to test things such as LSD and other drugs that could be used to control human behavior,” Helms told journalist David Frost, in an interview in 1978. Other U.S. intelligence agencies were brought on board to help conduct these controversial interrogation experiments. “In 1951 the CIA Director approved the liaison with Army, Navy, and Air Force intelligence to avoid duplication of effort,” writes Marks.", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:Operation Paperclip_cleaned.txt:266:7e77121bc9af", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 6179, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "Operation Paperclip_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/031622104X", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "Operation Paperclip_cleaned", "chunk_index": 267, "text": "Chinese in this field, and the only way to find out what the risks were was to test things such as LSD and other drugs that could be used to control human behavior,” Helms told journalist David Frost, in an interview in 1978. Other U.S. intelligence agencies were brought on board to help conduct these controversial interrogation experiments. “In 1951 the CIA Director approved the liaison with Army, Navy, and Air Force intelligence to avoid duplication of effort,” writes Marks. “The Army and Navy were both looking for truth drugs while the prime concern of the Air Force was interrogation techniques used on downed pilots.” Since the end of the war, the various U.S. military branches had developed advanced air, land, and sea rescue programs, based in part on research conducted by Nazi doctors. But the Soviets had also made great advances in rescue programs and this presented a serious new concern. If a downed U.S. pilot or soldier was rescued by the Russians, that person would almost certainly be subjected to unconventional interrogation techniques, according to the CIA. The purpose of Operation Bluebird was to try to predict what kinds of methods the Soviets might use against American soldiers and airmen. One of the so-called truth serum drugs the CIA believed the Soviets were most heavily involved in researching was LSD. One CIA report, later shared with Congress, stated that “the Soviets purchased a large quantity of LSD-25 from the Sandoz Company… reputed to be sufficient for 50 million doses.” Or so the CIA thought. A later analysis of the information determined that the CIA analyst working on the report made a decimal point error while performing dosage calculations. The Soviets had in fact purchased enough LSD from Sandoz for a few thousand tests—a far cry from fifty million. For its Operation Bluebird experiments involving LSD and other drugs, the CIA teamed up with the Army Chemical Corps. The initial research and development was conducted by officers with the Special Operations Division who worked inside a classified facility designated Building No. 439, a one-story concrete-block building set among similar-looking buildings at Camp Detrick so as to blend in. Almost no one outside the SO Division knew about the Top Secret work going on inside. The SO Division was paid for by the CIA’s Technical Services Staff (TSS), a unit within the CIA’s Clandestine Service; many of its field agents were culled from a pool of senior bacteriologists at Detrick. One of these SO Division field agents was Dr. Harold Batchelor, the man behind the Eight Ball who consulted with Dr. Kurt Blome in Heidelberg in 1947. Another SO Division agent was Dr. Frank Olson, a former army officer and bacteriologist turned Agency operative whose sudden demise in 1953 would nearly bring down the CIA.

The two men were assigned to the program at Camp King involving unconventional interrogation techniques. In April 1950, Frank Olson was issued a diplomatic passport. Olson was not a diplomat; the passport allowed him to carry items in a diplomatic pouch that would not be subject to searches by customs officials. Frank Olson began taking trips to Germany, flying to Frankfurt and making the short drive out to Camp King. In one of the rare surviving official documents from the program, Deputy Director of Central Intelligence Allen Dulles sent a secret memo to Richard Helms and CIA Deputy Director for Plans Frank Wisner regarding the specific kinds of interrogation techniques that would be used. “In our conversation of 9 February 1951, I outlined to you the possibilities of augmenting the usual interrogation methods by the use of drugs, hypnosis, shock, etc., and emphasized the defensive aspects as well as the offensive opportunities in this field of applied medical science,” wrote Dulles. “The enclosed folder, ‘Interrogation Techniques,’ was prepared in my Medical Division to provide you with a suitable background.” Camp King was the perfect location to conduct these trials. Overseas locations were preferred for Artichoke interrogations, since foreign governments “permitted certain activities which were not permitted by the United States government (i.e. anthrax etc.).” The next trip on record made by Frank Olson occurred on June 12, 1952. Olson arrived at Frankfurt from the Hendon military airport in England and made the short drive west into Oberursel. There, Artichoke interrogation experiments were taking place at a safe house called Haus Waldorf. “Between 4 June 1952 and 18 June 1952, an IS&O [CIA Inspection and Security Office] team… applied Artichoke techniques to two operational cases in a safe house,” explains an Artichoke memorandum, written for CIA director Dulles, and one of the few action memos on record not destroyed by Richard Helms when he was CIA director. The two individuals being interrogated at the Camp King safe house “could be classed as experienced, professional type agents and suspected of working for Soviet Intelligence.” These were Soviet spies captured by the Gehlen Organization, now being run by the CIA. “In the first case, light dosages of drugs coupled with hypnosis were used to induce a complete hypnotic trance,” the memo reveals. “This trance was held for approximately one hour and forty minutes of interrogation with a subsequent total amnesia produced.” The plan was straightforward: drug the spies, interrogate the spies, and give them amnesia to make them", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:Operation Paperclip_cleaned.txt:268:2105361d6f7c", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 6181, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "Operation Paperclip_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/031622104X", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "Operation Paperclip_cleaned", "chunk_index": 269, "text": "and suspected of working for Soviet Intelligence.” These were Soviet spies captured by the Gehlen Organization, now being run by the CIA. “In the first case, light dosages of drugs coupled with hypnosis were used to induce a complete hypnotic trance,” the memo reveals. “This trance was held for approximately one hour and forty minutes of interrogation with a subsequent total amnesia produced.” The plan was straightforward: drug the spies, interrogate the spies, and give them amnesia to make them forget. Another surviving memo from this otherwise unreported chapter of Cold War history is from Dr. Henry Knowles Beecher, chief anesthetist at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston and a CIAarmy-navy adviser on Artichoke techniques. Beecher traveled to Germany to observe what was happening at Camp King. He was a colleague of Dr. Leopold Alexander’s in Boston and, like Alexander, was an outspoken advocate of the Nuremberg Code, the first principle of which is informed consent. And yet in one of the stranger Cold War cases of dissimulation, Dr. Beecher was a participant in secret, government-sponsored medical experiments that did not involve consent. Beecher was paid by the CIA and the navy to consult on how best to produce amnesia in Soviet spies after they were drugged and interrogated so they would forget what had been done to them. Dr. Frank Olson returned from Germany to his office in Detrick in a moral bind, according to his Detrick colleague the bacteriologist Norman Cournoyer. “He had a tough time after Germany… [d]rugs, torture, brainwashing,” Cournoyer explained decades later, for a documentary for German television made in 2001. Cournoyer said that Olson felt ashamed about what he had witnessed, and that the experiments at Camp King reminded him of what had been done to people in concentration camps. Back in America, Olson contemplated leaving his job. He told family members he was considering a new career, as a dentist. Instead, he stayed on at the bioweapons facility, becoming chief of the SO Division for a while. He continued to work on Top Secret biological and chemical weapons programs in the CIA’s office at Detrick, Building No. 439. Unknown to Frank Olson, the CIA was expanding its Artichoke program in new ways, including expanding its use of LSD in “unconventional interrogations” through covert means. Strapping a suspected Soviet spy to a chair and dosing him with drugs, as was done at Camp King’s Haus Waldorf, was one approach to getting a spy to spill his secrets. But the CIA wondered what would happen if an enemy agent were to be given an incapacitating agent like LSD on the sly, without knowing he had been drugged. Would this kind of amnesia be effective? Could it produce loyalty? How much, if any, of the experience would be remembered? These were questions the CIA wanted answered.

Could it produce loyalty? How much, if any, of the experience would be remembered? These were questions the CIA wanted answered. The director of the Technical Services Staff, Dr. Sidney Gottlieb, a stutterer with a club foot, decided that the first field tests should be conducted on men from the SO Division without them knowing about it. One of those targeted for experimentation was Dr. Frank Olson. A week before Thanksgiving, in November 1953, six SO Division agents including Frank Olson and the new SO Division chief, Vincent Ruwet, were invited to a weekend retreat at a CIA safe house in western Maryland called Deep Creek Lake. There, the men from Detrick were met by TSS director Sidney Gottlieb and his deputy, Robert Lashbrook, a chemist. One part of the agenda was to discuss the latest covert means of poisoning people with biological agents and toxic substances, including those that had been acquired from around the globe by Fritz Hoffmann, the Operation Paperclip scientist with the Chemical Corps. The second goal was to covertly dose the six SO Division men with LSD and record what happened. After dinner on the second night, Robert Lashbrook secretly added LSD to a bottle of Cointreau. The unwitting test subjects were all offered a drink, and all but two of the SO Division officers drank the aperitif; one had a heart condition and the other abstained from alcohol. Frank Olson had a terrible reaction to having been drugged with LSD. He became psychologically unstable and could not sleep. His boss, Vincent Ruwet, who had also been dosed, described his own LSD poisoning experience as “the most frightening experience I ever had or hope to have.” The CIA had at least one of their questions answered now; covert LSD poisoning did not produce amnesia. When Monday morning came around, Ruwet arrived for work at 7:30, as usual. Inside Detrick’s Building No. 439 he found a very agitated Dr. Frank Olson waiting for him. Olson told Ruwet that he was devastated by what had happened at Deep Creek Lake. He wanted to quit or be fired. Ruwet told him to give the issue some time and to get back to work. But when Ruwet arrived for work the following morning at 7:30, he again found Frank Olson waiting for him. Olson’s mental state had deteriorated considerably, and Ruwet decided that he needed medical help. He called Agency headquarters, in Washington, D.C., and told Robert Lashbrook what was going on. Frank Olson was privy to the CIA’s most controversial behavior modification and mind control programs.

Frank Olson was privy to the CIA’s most controversial behavior modification and mind control programs. If he had a psychotic break in public he could inadvertently talk—terribly ironic, since getting a man to spill his secrets was what this LSD poisoning program was all about. Were Frank Olson to talk, the Agency would have a nightmare on its hands. “Dr. Olson was in serious trouble and needed immediate professional attention,” Lashbrook wrote in an after-incident CIA report. Lashbrook told Vincent Ruwet to bring Olson to headquarters immediately. From there, the two men took Olson to a townhouse in New York City, at 133 East Fifty-eighth Street. There, Olson met with a doctor on the CIA’s payroll named Harold Abramson. Abramson was not a psychiatrist. He was an allergist and immunologist who worked on LSD tolerance experiments for the CIA, and he carried a Secret clearance of his own. Frank Olson told Dr. Abramson that he was suffering from memory loss, confusion, feelings of inadequacy, and terrible guilt. Dr. Abramson noted that Olson seemed to have a perfectly good memory and could remember people, places, and events easily on demand. In other words, Frank Olson’s problems were all in his mind. The next morning, Robert Lashbrook and Vincent Ruwet took Frank Olson on another visit, to another CIA contract employee, John Mulholland, a semifamous New York City magician. Like Dr. Abramson, magician John Mulholland had a Secret security clearance with the TSS. Mulholland taught CIA agents how to apply “the magician’s art to covert activities.” One of his specialties was “the delivery of various materials to unwitting subjects.” During the visit, Olson became suspicious of what was going on and asked to leave. By the next day, Frank Olson was hearing voices. He told Dr. Abramson that the CIA was trying to poison him, which they already had done at least once. Vincent Ruwet returned to Maryland to be with his family for Thanksgiving; Abramson and Lashbrook decided to have Frank Olson committed to the Chestnut Lodge sanitarium, in Rockville, Maryland. Conveniently, the CIA had doctors on staff there. Robert Lashbrook and Frank Olson spent one last night in New York City, in the Statler Hotel, on Seventh Avenue and Thirty-third Street. They were given room 1018A, on the tenth floor. After eating in the hotel restaurant, Olson and Lashbrook returned to their room to have a drink and watch television.

Olson called his wife for the first time since he had left home and told her not to worry— that he’d be home soon. Then he went to sleep. At approximately 2:30 a.m. Olson crashed through the hotel window and fell more than one hundred feet to his death on the street below. According to the coroner’s report, Olson hit the ground feet first, as if standing up, fell backward, and broke his skull. The Statler Hotel night manager, Armand Pastore, heard the impact and ran outside. He found Olson lying on the pavement, still alive. His eyes were open, Pastore told the police, and he tried to say something. But no words came out, and after a few moments, Frank Olson took his last breath. Pastore looked up to see which room Olson had come out of. He could see that one of the window shades in a room high above was sticking out, as if the shade had been down when Olson crashed through it. Pastore noted which room it might be. When the police arrived, he took them up to the tenth floor and into room 1018A, using the manager’s passkey to get inside. There, inside the bathroom, CIA agent Robert Lashbrook sat on the toilet seat in his underwear, holding his head in his hands. Lashbrook had already made two telephone calls. The first call was to the CIA’s director of the Technical Services Staff, Sidney Gottlieb, the man who had, with Lashbrook, poisoned Frank Olson with LSD a little over a week before. The second call was to the hotel’s front desk, to report Olson’s suicide. When New York City Police detective James W. Ward arrived on the scene, he asked Robert Dr. Lashbrook was taken in for questioning; homicide had not yet been ruled out. At the precinct, Detective Ward asked Lashbrook to empty his pockets. Among the contents were papers with addresses for Dr. Harold Abramson, in New York City, and the Chestnut Lodge sanitarium, in Rockville, Maryland. When asked about his profession, Lashbrook told Detective Ward that he was a chemist with the War Department and that Frank Olson was a scientist at Camp Detrick—and that Olson was mentally ill. Detective Ward called Dr. Abramson, who verified Lashbrook’s story, leaving out that he also worked for the CIA.

If the Greek philosopher Heraclitus is right and war is the father of all things, then America’s Nazi scientist program was a nefarious child of the Second World War. Operation Paperclip in turn created a host of monstrous offspring, including Operations Bluebird, Artichoke, and MKUltra. Before Frank Olson became involved in the CIA’s poisoning and interrogation programs, he conducted research and development of the airborne delivery of biological weapons. Olson had been working in the field of biological weapons research since 1943. He was recruited by Detrick’s first director, Ira Baldwin, during the war. After the war, Dr. Olson became a civilian scientist at Detrick. He joined the Special Operations Division in 1950 and was part of a team that covertly tested how a weaponized biological agent might disperse if used against Americans. In the late 1940s and early 1950s, Olson had traveled across the United States overseeing field tests that dispersed biological agents from aircraft and crop dusters in San Francisco, the Midwest, and Alaska. Some field tests involved harmless simulants and others involved dangerous pathogens, as Senate hearings later revealed. One such dangerous experiment was conducted by Olson and his Detrick colleague Norman Cournoyer. The two men went to Alaska and oversaw bacteria being sprayed out of airplanes to see how the pathogens would disperse in an environment similar to that of a harsh Russian winter. “We used a spore,” Cournoyer explained, “which is very similar [to] anthrax, so to that extent we did something that was not kosher. Because we picked it up all over [the United States] months after we did the tests.” A third man involved in the covert tests with Cournoyer and Olson was Dr. Harold Batchelor, the bacteriologist who learned airborne spray techniques from Dr. Kurt Blome, whom Batchelor consulted with in Heidelberg. Olson and Batchelor also conducted covert field tests in closed spaces across America, including in subways and in the Pentagon. For these tests, the Special Operations Division used a relatively harmless pathogen that simulated how a deadly pathogen would disperse. A congressional inquiry into these covert tests found them “appalling” in their deception. By being part of a team of covert poisoners, be it out in the Alaskan tundra or inside a safe house at Camp King in Germany, Dr. Frank Olson and his colleagues violated the Nuremberg Code, which requires informed consent.

But in 1952, the heedless momentum of Operation Paperclip began to slow as conflicts emerged between the JIOA and the CIA over policies with the new West German government. German officials warned High Commissioner John J. McCloy that Operation Paperclip violated NATO regulations and even America’s own policies for governance in Germany. On February 21, 1952, McCloy sent a memo to the U.S. Secretary of State expressing his concern that if Paperclip was not curtailed, it could result in a “violent reaction” from officials in West Germany. With McCloy no longer expressing unbridled enthusiasm for Operation Paperclip, the JIOA began to lose its once indomitable grip on the program. But the CIA was not bound to the same NATO policies as were the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and so the CIA continued to do what it had been doing—namely, recruiting Nazi scientists and intelligence officers to act as advisers at Camp King. The five-year partnership between the two agencies began to unravel. JIOA officials became furious as they watched the CIA poach German scientists and technicians from the Accelerated Paperclip lists. In response, and in spite of McCloy’s requests otherwise, in the winter of 1952 the JIOA prepared to send a twenty-man team to Frankfurt on a recruiting trip. Delegates included JIOA’s new deputy director, Colonel Gerold Crabbe; General Walter Dornberger; and five unnamed Paperclip scientists who were already working in America. When McCloy learned of the trip, he asked the State Department to intervene and cancel it, fearing it would draw the ire of German officials, which it did. The trip happened anyway. A compromise was reached between U.S. officials and Chancellor Konrad Adenauer’s office whereby the JIOA and the CIA agreed to stop recruiting new scientists but could continue to work with the scientists who remained on the original, President Truman–approved, thousand-person list. Official numbers vary dramatically in different declassified record groups, but there were approximately six hundred Paperclip scientists in the United States at this time, meaning some four hundred German scientists were still on the target list. JIOA renamed Paperclip the Defense Scientists Immigration Program, or DEFSIP, and the CIA renamed one vein of its involvement the National Interest program, but most parties still referred to it all as Operation Paperclip. It was a dwindling empire.

It was a dwindling empire. In 1956 the CIA ceded control of the Gehlen Organization to the West German government, which renamed it the BND (Bundesnachrichtendienst). The former Nazi general and his men were spies for Chancellor Adenauer’s government now. Then, in 1957, JIOA got a new officer in Lieutenant Colonel Henry Whalen, a man whose actions would have a profound effect on the legacy of the Paperclip program. By 1959 Whalen was promoted to deputy director of JIOA, which meant he had access to highly classified intelligence reports from scientists working on atomic, biological, and chemical weapons. Whalen had an office in the “E” Ring of the Pentagon, reserved for senior officials, and enjoyed direct access to the Joint Chiefs of Staff. During his year-long tenure as JIOA deputy director, no one had any idea that Whalen was working as a Soviet spy. It wasn’t until 1963 that the FBI learned that he had been passing military secrets to Colonel Sergei Edemski, a GRU intelligence agent posing as a military attaché in the Soviet embassy in Washington. By then Henry Whalen had already left the JIOA. When the Justice Department began investigating Whalen, they seized all of the JIOA records that he had been working with. The FBI learned that Whalen had destroyed or given away thousands of Paperclip files. In 1966, a grand jury was presented with evidence against Whalen behind closed doors. He was indicted and the trial was conducted under a gag order, with the press denied access to what the FBI had learned and to Whalen’s confession. Journalists were prohibited from reporting on the trial, and no one made the connection between Whalen, the JIOA, and Operation Paperclip. The Nazi scientist program had long since faded from public discourse. Whalen was sentenced to fifteen years at a federal penitentiary but was paroled after six years. Most of the FBI’s investigation of Whalen remains classified, which likely explains why so few Paperclip files from that time frame are housed at the National Archives. In 1962, the JIOA was officially disbanded. What remained of the Paperclip program was taken over by the Research and Engineering Department at the Pentagon. Under the DoD Reorganization Act of 1958, this new office had been created to handle the military’s scientific and engineering needs under a scientific director who reported to the Secretary of Defense. The act also gave a home to the Pentagon’s new in-house, cutting-edge science agency—the Advanced Research Projects Agency, or ARPA, later renamed DARPA—with", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:Operation Paperclip_cleaned.txt:275:7f95d6e2e751", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 6188, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "Operation Paperclip_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/031622104X", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "Operation Paperclip_cleaned", "chunk_index": 276, "text": "In 1962, the JIOA was officially disbanded.

The act also gave a home to the Pentagon’s new in-house, cutting-edge science agency—the Advanced Research Projects Agency, or ARPA, later renamed DARPA—with a D for defense. The first director of the Research and Engineering Department was the nuclear physicist Herbert York. York also served as the first scientific director of ARPA. He was one of the nation’s leading experts on nuclear weapons and on Intercontinental Ballistic Missiles, or ICBMs. The ICBM is the “truly revolutionary military offspring” of Hitler’s V-2 rocket, says Michael J. Neufeld, curator of the Department of Space History at the Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum and author of several books and monographs on German rocket scientists. The ICBM is capable of carrying, in its nose cone, a weapon of mass destruction and delivering it to a target almost anywhere in the world. The ICBM became the centerpiece of the Cold War—the ultimate sword. It also became the ultimate shield. “Total war” with the Soviets never happened. The Cold War never became a shooting war. Deterrence prevailed. Today, the Research and Engineering Department at the Pentagon, renamed the Department of Defense Research and Engineering Enterprise, develops all next-generation weapons and counterweapons of mass destruction—the twenty-first century’s swords and shields. It is as true today as it was when World War II ended that America relies upon the advancement of science and technology—and industry—to prepare for the next war. This relationship is understood as America’s military-industrial complex. It was President Eisenhower who, in his Farewell Address to the nation in 1961, coined this phrase. Eisenhower cautioned Americans to be wary of “the acquisition of unwarranted influence, whether sought or unsought, by the military-industrial complex.” Eisenhower’s famous warning is well known and often paraphrased. But he also delivered a second warning in his farewell speech, not nearly as well known. Eisenhower told the American people that, indeed, science and research played a crucial role in national security, “[y]et, in holding scientific research and discovery in respect, as we should, we must also be alert to the equal and opposite danger that public policy could itself become the captive of a scientific-technological elite.” Herbert York, as both ARPA chief and director of the Research and Engineering Department at the Pentagon, worked closely with President Eisenhower on matters of military science during the last three years of Eisenhower’s presidency. He was deeply troubled by Eisenhower’s words in his Farewell Address. “Scientists and technologists had acquired the reputation of being magicians who had access to a special source of information and wisdom out", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:Operation Paperclip_cleaned.txt:276:c6784a8cd970", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 6189, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "Operation Paperclip_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/031622104X", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "Operation Paperclip_cleaned", "chunk_index": 277, "text": "that public policy could itself become the captive of a scientific-technological elite.” Herbert York, as both ARPA chief and director of the Research and Engineering Department at the Pentagon, worked closely with President Eisenhower on matters of military science during the last three years of Eisenhower’s presidency. He was deeply troubled by Eisenhower’s words in his Farewell Address. “Scientists and technologists had acquired the reputation of being magicians who had access to a special source of information and wisdom out of reach of the rest of mankind,” said York. In the mid-1960s, York went to visit Eisenhower at the former president’s winter home, in the California desert. “I asked him to explain more fully what he meant by the warnings, but he declined to do so,” York said. “I pressed this line of questions further by asking him whether he had any particular people in mind when he warned us about ‘the danger that public policy could itself become the captive of a scientific-technological elite.’” York was surprised when Eisenhower “answered without hesitation: ‘(Wernher) von Braun and (Edward) Teller [father of the hydrogen bomb].’” York spent decades considering what the President had told him. “Eisenhower’s warnings[,] which were based largely on his intuition, pointed up very real and extremely serious problems. If we forget or downgrade his warnings, it will be to our peril,” York wrote in his memoir, Arms and the Physicist, in 1995. The legacy of some of the Operation Paperclip scientists as individuals parallels the heritage of many of the Cold War weapons programs they participated in. The biological and chemical weapons programs can now be looked back upon as distinct failures and the product of vague and often wrong intelligence. So it was with the Chemical Corps’ relationship with former SS–Brigadier General Dr. Walter Schieber. Declassified files reveal that Schieber was double-crossing the Americans from the moment he began working for the U.S. Army in Germany, including the entire time he worked for Brigadier General Charles Loucks on the sarin gas project at Loucks’s private home in Heidelberg. It took military intelligence until 1950 to determine that something about Hitler’s trusted servant was untoward, and even longer to fully realize the extent to which Speer’s Armaments Supply Office chief was deceiving them. Almost immediately after Schieber was released from Nuremberg, he began using his old Nazi contacts to sell heavy weapons to at least one enemy nation through a Swiss intermediary. In 1950, military intelligence intercepted a four-page letter addressed to Schieber, sent from Switzerland. There was no return address on the envelope and only an illegible signature inside. The letter writer discussed with Schieber the sale of weapons to a third party, describing the buyer as “A Prince of the Royal House,” which military intelligence surmised was a code name. “They are looking for everything, tanks, aircraft, etc., weapons, ammunitions in short everything that pertains", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:Operation Paperclip_cleaned.txt:277:57d49db43c6f", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 6190, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "Operation Paperclip_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/031622104X", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "Operation Paperclip_cleaned", "chunk_index": 278, "text": "nation through a Swiss intermediary.

I can’t write all that in a telegraph,” stated the author, who requested “PAK anti-tank guns… willing to pay $5, 000 a piece; 75 mm weapons at $3, 000 − 94, 000 a piece, and 50mm (about $2,000.00).” This was a “first class business deal if we could arrange it,” the intermediary promised. Special Agent Carlton F. Maxwell, commander of a CIC Team in Heidelberg, was assigned the task of analyzing the letter and the situation. Maxwell quickly determined that the letter was legitimate and its implications dangerous. “Dr. Schieber, described as an extremely valuable scientist in the employ of the Chemical Division, EUCOM, where he possibly has access to Chemical Corps information of a highly classified nature, appears to be one person whom the United States can ill afford to have involved in any sort of international scheme of the nature which the letter seems to imply,” Maxwell wrote. “Subject’s connections during the Nazi regime with the armament industry, in his capacity as Armaments Supply Chief under Dr. Albert Speer, would make him valuable as a consultant and intermediary in any sort of plan involving illegal sales and shipments of arms.” It is remarkable that despite many warning signs, the U.S. Army placed so much trust in Schieber in the first place, and that General Loucks was allowed to make back-door deals with him. Special Agent Maxwell worried that “in light of recent indication of revival of right-wing activity it is not impossible to image that these arms might be used in a possible German monarchist coup.” Schieber needed to be watched closely, Maxwell advised. The Counter Intelligence Corps put a tail on him and followed him into the Soviet zone. In four months’ time, CIC confirmed, “Schieber has contacts with a Swiss Import-Export Agency in a dubious transaction involving the sale and shipment of arms to a foreign power.” But there was even worse news for U.S. national security. The CIC also learned that Schieber was working for Soviet intelligence. “Subject is in some way involved with the MGB [Ministerstvo Gosudarstvennoi Bezopasnosti, or the Ministry of State Security, a forerunner of Komitet Gosudarstvennoi Bezopasnosti, or the KGB] in Weimar,” Maxwell learned.

Maxwell advised his superiors that it appeared Schieber was a Soviet mole and summarized the dangers involved. Schieber had been cleared to work with highly classified material for the U.S. Chemical Corps, including but not limited to tabun and sarin nerve gas. He had worked on classified design projects involving underground bunker systems for the U.S. Air Force, ones that would supposedly protect the U.S. government’s greatest military assets in the event of a nuclear attack. And now he was meeting with Soviet agents who were connected to the intelligence service. Maxwell was told to notify the CIA. The response from the Agency was surprising. “Just forget it,” the CIA told Maxwell, and he was instructed to share this message with his colleagues inside the Counter Intelligence Corps. According to declassified memos in Schieber’s file, in addition to working for the Chemical Corps, Schieber was also working for the CIA. The Agency told Special Agent Maxwell that they had Schieber under their control. Whether that meant that Schieber was spying on the Soviets as part of an Agency plan or that he was double-crossing both nations remains a mystery. Either way, he was also working on an illegal arms deal. According to a declassified memo in Schieber’s foreign scientist case file, he remained on the Operation Paperclip payroll until 1956. In America, Dr. Walter Schieber left an indelible mark on the future of the U.S. Chemical Corps. After he and his team of Farben chemists provided General Loucks with the secret of sarin gas, the United States began stockpiling the deadly nerve agent for use in the event of total war. The program was fast-tracked at the start of the Korean War. On October 31, 1950, Secretary of Defense George C. Marshall authorized $50 million (roughly $500 million in 2013) for the design, engineering, and construction of two separate sarin production facilities, one in Muscle Shoals, Alabama, and another inside the Rocky Mountain Arsenal. Most information on biological and chemical weapons was classified, and no one outside a core group of senior congressmen who portioned out money for these programs had a need to know about them. “Only five members of the House Appropriations Committee, and no more than 5 percent of the entire House of Representatives, were cleared for information on chemical and biological weapons,” writes chemical weapons expert Jonathan Tucker. “As a result, a small clique of senior congressmen was able to allocate money for these programs in secret session and then bury the line items in massive appropriations bills that were brought to the floor for a vote with little advance notice,", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:Operation Paperclip_cleaned.txt:279:3f720e37724a", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 6192, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "Operation Paperclip_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/031622104X", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "Operation Paperclip_cleaned", "chunk_index": 280, "text": "about them. “Only five members of the House Appropriations Committee, and no more than 5 percent of the entire House of Representatives, were cleared for information on chemical and biological weapons,” writes chemical weapons expert Jonathan Tucker. “As a result, a small clique of senior congressmen was able to allocate money for these programs in secret session and then bury the line items in massive appropriations bills that were brought to the floor for a vote with little advance notice, so that few members had time to read them.” Sarin production took off at a frenzied pace. Twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week, 365 days a year, the two plants cranked out thousands of tons of sarin nerve agent each year. The facility at Rocky Mountain Arsenal, code-named Building 1501, was a windowless five-story blockhouse designed to withstand a 6.0 earthquake and 100-mph winds. It was the largest poured concrete structure in the United States, and for years, no one in America without a need to know had any idea what went on inside. The Chemical Corps also fast-tracked its chemical warfare munitions program, developing state-of-the-art weapons with which to deliver deadly nerve agents in battle. At the Rocky Flats munitions loading plant, sarin was fitted into artillery shells, aerial bombs, rockets, and warheads for missiles, with the preferred method of delivery being the M34 cluster bomb, a 1,000- pound metal cylinder with 75 sarin-filled mini-bombs sealed inside. Shortly after the Korean War ended with an armistice on July 27, 1953, the Chemical Corps began releasing public service announcements to educate Americans about chemical warfare. In November 1953, when Collier’s magazine published “G-Gas: A New Weapon of Chilling Terror. We Have It— So Does Russia,” the public learned for the first time that World War III with the Soviets would most likely involve nerve agents. Journalist Cornelius Ryan presented the information about sarin in the starkest of terms. “Right now, you and your family—all of us—are unprotected against the threat of a terror weapon which could prove more deadly than an atomic bomb.” The army described sarin as “an odorless, colorless, tasteless nerve gas designed to destroy people with paralyzing suddenness” and warned Americans of a possible “Pearl Harbor–type attack.” Ryan described for readers a scenario wherein a Russian strategic bomber, the Tu-4, carrying seven tons of sarin bombs, would drop its load on an American city, killing every unprotected human in a 100-square-mile radius within four minutes of the attack. The chief of the Chemical Corps, Major General E. F. Bullene, promised the nation that the only defense was offense. “At this time the only safe course is to be prepared to defend ourselves and ready to use gas in overpowering quantities.” Brinkmanship—the practice of pushing dangerous events to the edge, or brink, of disaster—was the new Cold War mentality.

In 1957, after years of producing sarin and filling munitions around the clock, the Chemical Corps finally fulfilled the Defense Department’s stockpile requirement. Later that same year, Edgewood chemists found an even more lethal killer, “a toxic insecticide that penetrated the skin like snake venom,” explains Jonathan Tucker. This nerve agent was code-named VX (the V stood for venomous) —a battlefield killer that was three times more toxic than sarin when inhaled and one thousand times more lethal when it came in contact with the skin. Ten milligrams of VX could kill a man in fifteen minutes. VX would be much more effective on the battlefield than sarin ever would be; sarin dissipated within fifteen or so minutes, but when VX was sprayed, it stayed on the ground for up to twenty-one days. Now, in 1957, the Chemical Corps began producing VX by the thousands of tons. Operation Paperclip scientist Fritz Hoffmann moved over from synthesizing tabun at Edgewood to working on VX munitions. But Fritz Hoffmann’s more haunting legacy lies in the work he performed for the CIA’s Special Operations Division and the Chemical Corps’ antiplant division. Antiplant agents include chemical or biological pathogens, as well as insects, that are then used as part of a program to harm crops, foliage, or other plant life. Creek Lake, Maryland, was assigned to also work on the CIA’s assassination-by-poison program. Fritz Hoffmann was one of the chemists at the locus of this program. “He was our searcher,” Edgewood laboratory director Dr. Seymour Silver told journalist Linda Hunt. “He was the guy who brought to our attention any discoveries that happened around the world and then said, ‘Here’s a new chemical, you better test it.’” Hoffmann’s daughter, Gabriella, remembers her unusually tall, soft-spoken father regularly traveling the globe in the late 1950s and early 1960s, always with a military escort, gathering obscure poisons from exotic toads, fish, and plants. “He would send me postcards from places like Japan, Australia and Hawaii,” she recalls. “He always flew military and he was always escorted by military staff. They would pick him up at our house and bring him back home on a Sunday night.” A teenager at the time, Gabriella Hoffmann remembers the unconventional items her father brought home. “He’d unpack his luggage before he would go back to Edgewood on Monday and in his suitcase he’d have all these little jars.

They were filled with sea urchins and things. It all seemed very exotic to me.” The poisons Fritz Hoffmann sought for the CIA included substances like curare, a South American blowpipe poison that paralyzes and kills people. Curare was the poison that the CIA’s U-2 pilots carried in their flight suit pockets, hidden inside a tiny sheath inserted into an American coin. The SO Division had a Device Branch, which was run by Herb Tanner, co-designer of the Eight Ball. The Device Branch was responsible for the hardware behind the delivery systems, including fountain pens filled with poison projectiles, briefcases that spread bacterial aerosols, poisoned candies, invisible powders, and the “non discernible microbioinoculator,” a high-tech dart gun that injected a tiny, poison-tipped dart into the bloodstream without leaving a mark on the body. In other situations it behooved the CIA to locate and weaponize a poison where death came after a delay, sometimes with an incubation period of about eight or twelve hours, sometimes much longer. The SO Division’s Agent Branch worked to find poisons that could make a target mildly ill for a short or long period of time followed by death, very ill for a short or long time followed by death, or any number of combinations, including mild to extreme illness followed by death. The rationale behind assassinating someone with a built-in time delay was to allow the assassin to get away and to deflect suspicion. SO Division targets included Fidel Castro, whose favorite drink, a milkshake, the CIA tried to poison several times. Another CIA target was Patrice Lumumba, the first legally elected prime minister of Congo, who the CIA believed was a Soviet puppet. Sidney Gottlieb, the man who poisoned Frank Olson, was assigned the job of assassin. Gottlieb later told congressional investigators that for this job, he needed to locate a poison that was “indigenous to that area [Congo] and that could be fatal.” Gottlieb decided on botulinum toxin. Armed with this toxin concealed inside a glass jar within a diplomatic pouch, Sidney Gottlieb traveled to Congo with the intention of killing Prime Minister Lumumba himself. On September 26, 1960, Gottlieb arrived in the capital, Léopoldville, and headed to the U.S. embassy. There, Ambassador Lawrence Devlin was expecting him. Two days prior, Ambassador Devlin had received a Top Secret cable from CIA director Allen Dulles. “We wish give every possible support in eliminating Lumumba from any possiblity [sic] resuming govermental position,” Dulles wrote.", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:Operation Paperclip_cleaned.txt:282:eecd9d6ab176", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 6195, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "Operation Paperclip_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/031622104X", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "Operation Paperclip_cleaned", "chunk_index": 283, "text": "concealed inside a glass jar within a diplomatic pouch, Sidney Gottlieb traveled to Congo with the intention of killing Prime Minister Lumumba himself.

Two days prior, Ambassador Devlin had received a Top Secret cable from CIA director Allen Dulles. “We wish give every possible support in eliminating Lumumba from any possiblity [sic] resuming govermental position,” Dulles wrote. Ambassador Devlin knew to be on the lookout for a visitor who would introduce himself as “Joe from Paris.” This was Sidney Gottlieb. Gottlieb’s plan was to inject the botulinum toxin into Lumumba’s toothpaste tube with a hypodermic syringe. Ideally, Lumumba would brush his teeth and eight hours later he’d be dead. But while in Léopoldville, Gottlieb could get nowhere near Prime Minister Lumumba, who was living in a house on a cliff high above the Congo River. Lumumba was constantly surrounded by bodyguards. After several days, the botulinum toxin lost its potency. Gottlieb mixed it with chlorine, tossed it into the Congo River, and left Africa. Patrice Lumumba died in January of the following year, beaten to death—allegedly by Belgian mercenaries. “My father understood the risks [of] being a chemist at Edgewood,” Gabriella Hoffmann says. “Because he never spoke of anything he did there is so much that is unknown.” For Gabriella Hoffmann, memories of an unusual childhood include trips to military bases. “Whenever we traveled, me and my mom and dad, it was always to a military installation. We went to White Sands in New Mexico. We went to military bases in California, Arizona, North Dakota, and Dugway, Utah. I remember dad giving a lecture at Dugway Proving Ground.” Hoffmann was a central player in some of the most mysterious and controversial government programs of the 1950s and 1960s, but the record of most of his work was destroyed or, as of 2013, remains classified. Gabriella Hoffmann is in the dark about her father’s legacy, as is most of the rest of the world. What remains are Gabriella Hoffmann’s memories of the company her father kept. Dr. L. Wilson Greene, the man who coined the term “psychochemical warfare,” lived down the street and was a colleague and family friend. During the late 1950s and early 1960s, Greene continued his LSD research for the army and the CIA’s psychochemical warfare programs. LSD and other incapacitating agents were tested on thousands of U.S. soldiers and sailors with a questionable degree of informed consent. To Gabriella Hoffmann, Greene was simply an eccentric neighbor. “I recall [going] to the Greenes’ house to see the amazing train garden, his hobby, that he built in the basement. It [had] hills and towns and little people. Ponds and lights and trains that whistled and chugged along with wisps of smoke. My attention and interest was", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:Operation Paperclip_cleaned.txt:283:99d230a43d23", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 6196, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "Operation Paperclip_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/031622104X", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "Operation Paperclip_cleaned", "chunk_index": 284, "text": "warfare programs.

It [had] hills and towns and little people. Ponds and lights and trains that whistled and chugged along with wisps of smoke. My attention and interest was solely on the trains.” Another unusual neighbor on the same street was Maurice Weeks, from the Directorate of Medical Research at Edgewood. Weeks was chief of the Vapor Toxicity Branch, with expertise regarding “ the inhalation toxicity of combustion products,” and spent his time researching how biological and chemical agents became even more deadly when smoke and gas were involved. This picked up where Dr. Kurt Blome’s research left off; it had been discussed by Blome in Operation Paperclip consultations in Heidelberg. “Maurice Weeks was a neighbor of ours,” recalls Gabriella Hoffmann. “His son, Christopher, and I were the best of friends. There were all these monkeys in cages in Christopher’s backyard. Christopher and I would amuse ourselves watching these monkeys for hours on end. Obviously it never dawned on me back then what they were for.” Gabriella only learned the true nature of her father’s job during interviews for this book. The strange, tragic thing about Fritz Hoffmann and his legacy in Operation Paperclip is that during the war he was anti-Nazi—at least according to the affidavit written by the wartime American diplomat Sam Woods. And yet here in America, working for the Army Chemical Corps and for the CIA, Fritz Hoffmann’s science projects took on a monstrous life of their own. This includes what his daughter believes was a role in the development of Agent Orange, the antiplant weapon, or defoliant, used by the U.S. military during the Vietnam War. “During the Vietnam War, I remember one evening we were at the dinner table and the war was on the news,” Gabriella Hoffmann explains. The family was watching TV. “Dad was usually a quiet man, so when he spoke up you remembered it. He pointed to the news—you could see the jungles of Vietnam, and he said, ‘Wouldn’t it be easier to defoliate the trees so you could see the enemies?’ The army’s herbicidal warfare program during the Vietnam War started in August 1961 and lasted until February 1971. More than 11.4 million gallons of Agent Orange were sprayed over approximately 24 percent of South Vietnam, destroying 5 million acres of uplands and forests and 500,000 acres of food crops—an area about the size of the state of Massachusetts. An additional 8 million gallons of other anticrop agents, code-named Agents White, Blue, Purple, Pink, and Green, were also sprayed, mostly from C-123 cargo planes. Fritz Hoffmann was one", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:Operation Paperclip_cleaned.txt:284:188ae2e301b3", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 6197, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "Operation Paperclip_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/031622104X", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "Operation Paperclip_cleaned", "chunk_index": 285, "text": "Vietnam War started in August 1961 and lasted until February 1971.

An additional 8 million gallons of other anticrop agents, code-named Agents White, Blue, Purple, Pink, and Green, were also sprayed, mostly from C-123 cargo planes. Fritz Hoffmann was one of the earliest known U.S. Army Chemical Corps scientists to research the toxic effects of dioxin—possibly in the mid-1950s but for certain in 1959—as indicated in what has become known as the Hoffmann Trip Report. This document is used in almost every legal record pertaining to litigation by U.S. military veterans against the U.S. government and chemical manufacturers for its usage of herbicides and defoliants in the Vietnam War. It is the long-term effects of the Agent Orange program that Gabriella Hoffmann believes would have ruined her father, had he known. “Agent Orange turned out not only to defoliate trees but to cause great harm in children,” Gabriella Hoffmann says. “Dad was dead by then and I remember thinking, Thank God. It would have killed him to learn that. He was a gentle man. He wouldn’t hurt a fly.” Fritz Hoffmann’s untimely death came like something out of a Special Operations Division’s Agent Branch playbook. He suffered a serious illness that came on quickly, lasted for a relatively short time, and was followed by death. On Christmas Eve 1966, Fritz Hoffmann was diagnosed with cancer. Racked with pain, he lay in bed watching his favorite television shows—“Cowboy westerns and Rod Serling in The Twilight Zone,” Gabriella Hoffmann recalls. One hundred days later, Fritz Hoffmann was dead. He was fifty-six years old. “He did try, periodically, to go to work,” Gabriella Hoffmann remembers, “but he was in too much pain. I do have a recollection of a lot of different men in dark suits always coming by the house to talk to him. At the time, Demerol as a painkiller had just come on the market. He had a prescription for it, from a doctor at Edgewood. During the time that [he was dying] there were a lot of questions asked of my mother and [me] that led me to think the FBI or the CIA, or whoever the men in the dark suits were, were worried that my father would start talking about whatever it was that he did. He never did say anything. He was silent until the end.” Hoffmann’s antiplant work in herbicides was one element of Detrick’s three-part biological weapons division, the other two being antiman and antianimal. Antianimal weapons were aimed at killing entire animal populations, with the goal of starving to death the people who relied on those animals for food.

Antianimal weapons were aimed at killing entire animal populations, with the goal of starving to death the people who relied on those animals for food. At the locus of the U.S. antianimal program was Operation Paperclip’s Dr. Erich Traub, Dr. Kurt Blome’s deputy. Traub was recruited into the Accelerated Paperclip program by Dr. Blome’s handler, Charles McPherson, and arrived in America on April 4, 1949. Traub worked on virological research at the Naval Medical Research Institute, in Bethesda, Maryland. Almost all of Traub’s work remains classified as of 2013. At the Naval Medical Research Institute, Traub became friendly with the Luftwaffe physiologist and explosive decompression expert Dr. Theodor Benzinger, whose early work for the navy also remains classified. In addition to working for the navy, Traub worked at Camp Detrick on antianimal research. The agents and diseases being studied by Detrick researchers at this time, meant to decimate a specific animal population, included rinderpest, hoof-and-mouth disease (also called foot-and-mouth disease), Virus III disease of swine (likely African swine fever), fowl plague, Newcastle disease, and fowl malaria. All of Traub’s Camp Detrick work remains classified as of 2013. In 1948, Congress had approved a $30 million budget for antianimal weapons research (roughly $300 million in 2013), but because this work was so dangerous, Congress mandated that it needed to take place outside the continental United States, on an island and not connected to the nearest mainland by a bridge. Plans moved forward and the army chose Plum Island, a 1.3-square-mile land parcel located off the coast of Connecticut in the Long Island Sound. The obvious choice for a director was the world’s expert on antianimal research, Dr. Erich Traub. But the plan to activate Plum Island for biological weapons research languished for several years. Traub received his immigrant visa on September 7, 1951, and he worked on classified programs for three more years. Then, under mysterious circumstances, in 1954, he resigned his position as medical supervisory bacteriologist at the Naval Medical Research Institute and asked to be repatriated to Germany. He told the navy he’d accepted a position with the West German government, as director of the Federal Institute for Virus Research. This move alarmed the JIOA. “Dr. Traub is a recognized authority in certain fields of virology, particularly in hoof and mouth disease of cattle and in Newcastle disease of poultry,” read a declassified report. “It can be anticipated that this institution in Germany [where Traub was going] will become one of the leading research laboratories of the world in virological research.” In view of the “recognizable military potentialities", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:Operation Paperclip_cleaned.txt:286:2fdcfcb2f49b", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 6199, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "Operation Paperclip_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/031622104X", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "Operation Paperclip_cleaned", "chunk_index": 287, "text": "West German government, as director of the Federal Institute for Virus Research.

In Germany, throughout the late 1950s and early 1960s, U.S. military intelligence spied on Dr. Traub at his new home on Paul-Ehrlich-Strasse, in Tübingen. Agents stopped by the home of Traub’s colleague and friend Dr. Theodor Benzinger, in Maryland, to ask whether Benzinger knew “of any associations retained by Dr. Traub outside the United States.” Benzinger said he did not. Whenever Traub traveled outside Germany, military intelligence kept a watchful eye on him. Dr. Traub was a man experienced in the illegal trafficking of deadly pathogens. During World War II, he was the trustworthy scientist chosen by Heinrich Himmler to travel to Turkey to obtain samples of rinderpest to weaponize on Riems. And after the war, when Traub fled the Russian zone at great risk of personal harm, he managed to smuggle deadly cultures with him out of the Eastern bloc, which he then stashed at an intermediary laboratory in West Germany until he was able to locate an appropriate buyer. In the mid-1960s, according to Traub’s FBI file, Traub moved from Germany to Iran, with a new permanent address at the Razi Institute for Serums and Vaccines, in Hesarak, a suburb of the city of Karaj. When Traub traveled from Iran to the Shoreham Hotel in Washington, D.C., for a meeting with unknown persons, FBI agents watched him. What they learned about the mysterious Dr. Traub remains classified as of 2013. Through the lens of history, it is remarkable to think that U.S. biological warfare and chemical warfare programs grew so quickly to the size they did. But the Pentagon was able to keep the scope and cost of these weapons programs secret from Congress in much the same way that it was able to keep the damaging details of Operation Paperclip secret from the public. Everything was classified. It took President Richard Nixon to realize that playing chicken with the Russians, using a huge arsenal of biological and chemical weapons, was pure madness. On November 25, 1969, Nixon announced the end of all U.S. offensive biological warfare research and ordered that America’s arsenal was to be destroyed. “I have decided that the United States of America will renounce the use of", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:Operation Paperclip_cleaned.txt:287:92fb91239719", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 6200, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "Operation Paperclip_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/031622104X", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "Operation Paperclip_cleaned", "chunk_index": 288, "text": "was able to keep the damaging details of Operation Paperclip secret from the public.

On November 25, 1969, Nixon announced the end of all U.S. offensive biological warfare research and ordered that America’s arsenal was to be destroyed. “I have decided that the United States of America will renounce the use of any form of deadly biological weapons that either kill or incapacitate,” Nixon said. His reasons were simple and self-evident. The use of biological weapons could have “uncontrollable consequences” for the world. “Mankind already carries in its hands too many of the seeds of its own destruction,” said Nixon. After twenty-six years of research and development, America’s biological weapons programs came to an end. For the first time during the Cold War, a president decided that an entire group of weapons was going to be unilaterally destroyed. The end of America’s chemical weapons program was not far behind. Nixon reinstated the “retaliation-only” policy, which meant no new chemical weapons would be developed and produced. Over the next few years, Congress worked with the military to determine the best way to destroy this entire group of weapons. The original plan was to dispose of some twenty-seven thousand tons of chemical-filled weapons in the deep sea. But upon investigation, it turned out that many of the sarinand VX-filled bombs stored at the Rocky Mountain Arsenal were already leaking nerve agent. These munitions needed to be encased in steel-and-concrete “coffins” before they could be dumped in the ocean. The Pentagon also had thirteen thousand tons of nerve agent and mustard gas stored in secret on its military base in Okinawa, Japan, which now needed to be disposed of. In 1971, these munitions were brought to an American-owned atoll in the South Pacific called Johnston Island in an operation called Red Hat. The plan was to store the sarin-and VX-filled bombs in bunkers on the atoll until scientists figured out how best to destroy them. But as it turned out, the sarin and VX bombs were not made to ever be dismantled. So the army had a massive new scientific endeavor on its hands, for which it created the Johnston Atoll Chemical Agent Disposal System, the world’s first “full-scale chemical weapons disposal facility.” It took another thirty-four years for America’s arsenal of chemical weapons to be destroyed. “The numbers speak volumes,” says the army. “More than 412,000 obsolete chemical weapons—bombs, land mines, rockets and projectiles—all destroyed.” The elaborate destruction process involves the robotic separation of the chemical agent from the munitions, followed by incineration of the separated parts in three separate special types of furnaces. The army says it is “proud [of its] accomplishment,” which cost an estimated $25.8 billion as of 2006, or approximately", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:Operation Paperclip_cleaned.txt:288:4ad9e116d10a", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 6201, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "Operation Paperclip_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/031622104X", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "Operation Paperclip_cleaned", "chunk_index": 289, "text": "another thirty-four years for America’s arsenal of chemical weapons to be destroyed. “The numbers speak volumes,” says the army. “More than 412,000 obsolete chemical weapons—bombs, land mines, rockets and projectiles—all destroyed.” The elaborate destruction process involves the robotic separation of the chemical agent from the munitions, followed by incineration of the separated parts in three separate special types of furnaces.

America’s Cold War biological and chemical weapons programs existed in the shadows, and the majority of the Nazi scientists who worked on them maintained anonymity for decades. Their JIOA case files and OMGUS security reports were classified, as were the programs they worked on. But some of the Operation Paperclip scientists enjoyed the limelight for their work, notably in instances where their work crossed over from weapons projects into space-related endeavors. In this manner, Walter Dornberger, Wernher von Braun, and Hubertus Strughold attained varying degrees of prominence and prestige in the 1950s and 1960s and onward. Within two years of his arrival in the United States, Dornberger had transformed from public menace to American celebrity. In 1950 he left military custody at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base to work for Bell Aircraft Corporation in Niagara Falls, New York, quickly becoming vice president and chief scientist. His vocation was now to serve as America’s mouthpiece for the urgent need to weaponize space. Dornberger was given a Top Secret security clearance and a job consulting with the military on rockets, missiles, and the future of space-based weapons. In his desk diary, housed in the archives at the Deutsches Museum in Munich, he kept track of his cross-country business trips with an engineer’s precision. He attended “classified meetings” at U.S. Air Force bases including Wright-Patterson, Elgin, Randolph, Maxwell, and Holloman, as well as at Strategic Air Command headquarters, in Omaha, Nebraska, and the Pentagon. He also became a consultant to the Joint Chiefs on Operation Paperclip, visiting the inner circle in the Pentagon to discuss “clearance procedures” and the “hiring of German Scientists.” As a Paperclip scout, in 1952 Dornberger traveled with what he called “Pentagon Brass” to Germany to “interview German scientists and engineers [in] Frankfurt, Heidelberg, Wiesbaden, Stuttgart, Darmstadt, Witzenhausen.” In his desk diary Dornberger also detailed an ambitious schedule of public appearances, carefully noting the places he traveled and the people he met with. They were the kinds of engagements usually reserved for congressmen. Throughout the 1950s, he jetted from one event to the next, lecturing at dinners and luncheons and sometimes weeklong events. His speeches were always about conquest, with titles like “Rockets—Guided Missiles: Key to the Conquest of Space,” “Intercontinental Weapons Systems,” and “A Realistic Approach to the Conquest of Space.” He orated to anyone who would listen: the Men’s Club of St. Mark’s Episcopal", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:Operation Paperclip_cleaned.txt:289:ab6a7eeb9c8c", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 6202, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "Operation Paperclip_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/031622104X", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "Operation Paperclip_cleaned", "chunk_index": 290, "text": "traveled and the people he met with.

When the Rochester Junior Chamber of Commerce hosted General Dornberger for a women’s luncheon in the spring of 1953, the local press covered the event with the headline, “Buzz Bomb Mastermind to Address Jaycees Today.” Dornberger became so popular that his memoir about the V-2, originally published in West Germany in 1952, was published in America in 1954. In these pages, Dornberger was able to reengineer his professional history from that of warmongering Nazi general to beneficent science pioneer. According to Dornberger, the research and development that had gone into the V-2 at Peenemünde was a romantic, science-laboratory-by-the-sea affair. There was no mention made of the slave labor facility at Nordhausen or the slaves at Peenemünde. The book was originally titled V-2: The Shot into Space (V-2: Der Schuss ins All). “It would be nice to know who invented the subtitle,” says Michael J. Neufeld, “which so neatly captures the reinvention of a Nazi terror weapon as the space rocket it most certainly was not.” In 1957, Dornberger seemed to have found his true post-Nazi calling, attempting to sell Bell Aircraft’s BoMi (bomber-missile) to the Pentagon. BoMi was a rocket-powered manned spacecraft designed for nuclear combat in space. Occasionally, and behind closed doors, usually at the Pentagon, Dornberger faced challenges. He was once pitching the benefits of BoMi to an audience of air force officials when “abusive and insulting remarks” were shouted at him, according to air force historian Roy F. Houchin II. In that instance, Dornberger is said to have turned on his audience and insisted that BoMi would receive a lot more respect if Dornberger had had a chance to fly it against the United States during a war. There was “deafening silence,” in the room, Houchin noted. In 1958 the FBI opened an investigation into General Dornberger based on an insider’s tip that he might be engaged in secret discussions with Communist spies. The special agent who interviewed Dornberger did not believe he was spying for the Soviets but honed in on Dornberger’s duplicitous nature: “It is believed that subject [Dornberger] could carry on satisfactorily in the role of a double agent.” Dornberger was a cunning man, and this quality, coupled with his scientific acumen, served him.

No matter what the circumstances, Dornberger always seemed to come out on top. Wernher von Braun became the biggest celebrity of the Operation Paperclip scientists. By 1950, the army decided that it required a much larger facility to research and develop longer-range rockets, so the Fort Bliss rocket team moved from Texas to the Redstone Arsenal, near Huntsville, Alabama. There, the German scientists began work on the army’s Jupiter ballistic missile. The group had launched sixty-four V-2s from White Sands. At the same time, von Braun was ambitiously developing a persona for himself as America’s prophet of space travel. Rockets, outer space, and interplanetary travel had gained a foothold in American culture. It was the dream of many 1950s American children to fly into outer space, and von Braun and Dornberger became national spokesmen on this issue. They promised the nation that the army’s development of a ballistic missile was the necessary first step in reaching outer space. In 1952, von Braun experienced a breakthrough in his role of national space advocate when Collier’s magazine paid him $4, 000 (approximately $36, 000 in 2013) to write the lead article in what would eventually become an eight-part series on future space travel, edited by Cornelius Ryan. “Within the next 10 or 15 years,” von Braun wrote, “the earth will have a new companion in the skies, a man-made satellite that could be either the greatest force for peace ever devised, or one of the most terrible weapons of war—depending on who makes and controls it.” This space satellite, or station, would also be a “terribly effective atomic bomb carrier,” von Braun added. From its earliest days, space travel would be intertwined with war making. It still is. In addition to earning von Braun a small fortune, the Collier’s magazine series propelled him into the national spotlight, increasing his fame and affording him additional writing opportunities. Most important, this newfound limelight provided von Braun with a platform to recast himself as a patriotic American. In the summer of 1952, American Magazine published a piece with von Braun’s byline entitled “Why I Chose America,” in which he professed a deep love for America, Christianity, and democracy. In the article, von Braun claimed that during the war he opposed Nazism and was never in a position to do anything but follow orders. The piece earned him an award for “patriotic writing,” even though it had been written by a ghostwriter. The article was reprinted in at least one book and, explains Michael J.", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:Operation Paperclip_cleaned.txt:291:4aed2f5e4bab", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 6204, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "Operation Paperclip_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/031622104X", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "Operation Paperclip_cleaned", "chunk_index": 292, "text": "published a piece with von Braun’s byline entitled “Why I Chose America,” in which he professed a deep love for America, Christianity, and democracy.

The piece earned him an award for “patriotic writing,” even though it had been written by a ghostwriter. The article was reprinted in at least one book and, explains Michael J. Neufeld, would thereafter be “taken as a fundamental source by many later journalists and authors.” The national attention caught the eye of Walt Disney Studios, in Burbank, California, and an executive called von Braun to see if he wanted to film a couple of space-related shows for a new television series that Disney was working on. For over a year, von Braun had been trying to find a New York publisher for the science fiction novel he had written while living in the Texas desert. By this time, the novel had been rejected by eighteen publishers. The Disney contract offered a wider road to fame and von Braun signed on. The first Disneyland TV broadcast in which von Braun appeared, in 1955, called Man in Space, had an estimated 42 million viewers and was reported to be the second-highest-rated television show in American history at the time. The following month, on April 15, 1955, von Braun and many of his fellow German rocket scientists became U.S. citizens, in a public ceremony held in the Huntsville High School auditorium. In 1958, von Braun and his team launched America’s first successful space satellite, Explorer I, as a quick response to the Soviets’ Sputnik. Kurt Debus was in charge of the launch. In 1960, von Braun and a group of approximately 120 Operation Paperclip scientists, engineers, and technicians were transferred from the army to the newly established National Aeronautics and Space Administration, or NASA, with a mandate to build the Saturn rockets designed to take man to the moon. Von Braun was made director of the new NASA facility, the Marshall Space Flight Center, also located at the Redstone Arsenal, as well as chief architect of the Saturn V launch vehicle, or “superbooster” rocket, as it would become known. Von Braun’s deputy developer on the Saturn program was Arthur Rudolph, the former operations director at the Mittelwerk slave labor facility. The Saturn V rocket would need its own launch complex and hangar. Cape Canaveral, on Florida’s east coast, was chosen as the perfect site. On July 1, 1962, NASA activated its Launch Operations Center there, naming Kurt Debus as director. Debus was the ardent Nazi who, during the war and on his own volition, had turned an engineering colleague over to the Gestapo for making anti-Hitler remarks. To house the giant Saturn rocket, NASA constructed the Vertical Assembly Building on nearby Merritt Island.", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:Operation Paperclip_cleaned.txt:292:8439544d5da6", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 6205, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "Operation Paperclip_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/031622104X", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "Operation Paperclip_cleaned", "chunk_index": 293, "text": "rocket would need its own launch complex and hangar.

To house the giant Saturn rocket, NASA constructed the Vertical Assembly Building on nearby Merritt Island. The structure would soon become the most voluminous building in the world—larger than the Pentagon and almost as tall as the Washington Monument. It was designed by Bernhard Tessmann, former facilities designer at Peenemünde and Nordhausen, and one of the two men who, at war’s end, stashed the V-2 documents in the Dörnten mine. As had Dornberger, von Braun worked carefully to whitewash his Nazi past. He knew never to speak of the fact that he had become a Nazi Party member in 1937. When a reporter once asked him, incorrectly, about his joining the party “in 1942,” von Braun put his scientist’s precision aside and chose not to correct the newsman. Instead von Braun did what he always did—he said that he’d been coerced into joining the Nazi Party. Never did von Braun speak of the SS cavalry unit he joined, in 1933, or that he was made an SS officer in 1944 and wore the SS officer’s uniform, with its swastika on the armband and its cap with the death’s-head image. With a revelation like that, he could have been deported under the Internal Security Act of 1950, which was meant to keep Communists out of the country but also covered anyone who had held membership in a “totalitarian dictatorship.” Instead, the fact that he was an officer with the SS remained a jealously guarded secret by all parties —von Braun, the U.S. military, and NASA until CNN journalist Linda Hunt broke the story in 1985. But the dark shadow of von Braun’s complicity in Nazi war crimes followed him around. Sometimes it snuck up on him from behind. One day, while visiting the Collier’s offices, he was riding in the elevator with fellow Paperclip Scientist Heinz Haber, from the School of Aviation Medicine at Randolph Air Force Base, and Cornelius Ryan, his editor. Also in the elevator were a few Collier’s magazine staffers, one of whom reached out to Haber, rubbed a piece of the scientist’s leather coat between his fingers, and said wryly, “Human skin, of course?” As man got closer and closer to the moon, Wernher von Braun enjoyed a parallel ascent in fortune and in fame. Because von Braun was a public figure, his Nazi past was always there, but in shadow. By the 1960s, it was sometimes treated as a joke.

Because von Braun was a public figure, his Nazi past was always there, but in shadow. By the 1960s, it was sometimes treated as a joke. One night, before an Apollo mission, von Braun stormed out of a press conference after a reporter asked him if he could guarantee that the rocket would not hit London. Tom Lehrer wrote a song famously satirizing von Braun: “ ‘Once the rockets are up, who cares where they come down? That’s not my department,’ says Wernher von Braun.” Filmmaker Stanley Kubrick created a von Braun–inspired character in his black comedy Dr. Strangelove, in which a mad scientist famously gets out of a wheelchair and cries, “Mein Führer, I can walk!” But in 1963, in East Berlin, a popular author and lawyer named Julius Mader wrote a book called The Secret of Huntsville: The True Career of Rocket Baron Wernher von Braun. On the dust jacket there was a drawing of von Braun wearing a black SS-Sturmbannführer’s uniform. Around von Braun’s neck was the Knight’s Cross, bestowed upon him by Albert Speer at the Castle Varlar event. The book, published by Deutscher Militärverlag, portrayed von Braun as an ardent Nazi and included detailed pages about the murderous conditions at the slave labor facility at Nordhausen, where von Braun oversaw work, and at the Dora-Nordhausen concentration camp, which supplied the slave laborers. Several German-speaking U.S. citizens alerted NASA about the allegations against von Braun, as if NASA did not know. The space agency’s three top officials, James E. Webb, Hugh Dryden, and Robert Seamans, discussed the situation with von Braun and counseled him on how to handle it. If anyone were to ask him about this matter, NASA administrator James Webb told von Braun pointedly, his answer was to be, “Everything related to my past activity in Germany… is well known to the U.S. Government.” In the end, nothing much came of the book in the Western world. The narrative mixed “damaging facts” with “completely fabricated scenes,” explains von Braun’s biographer Michael J. Neufeld, which made the book easy to discount. When NASA learned that the book’s author, Julius Mader, worked as an intelligence agent for the East German secret police, the revelations lost their potential power. If need be, Mader’s book could be discounted as Sovietengineered lies, meant only to damage the prestige of the U.S. space program. The Secret of Huntsville: The True Career of Rocket Baron Wernher von Braun was a success in the Eastern bloc. It was also translated into Russian and sold half a million copies in the Soviet Union.

The book inspired a Soviet-sponsored film, Die Gefrorenen Blitze (Frozen Lightning), also written by Mader and released by the East German state film studio, DEFA (Deutsche Film-Aktiengesellschaft), in 1967. The same year, West German prosecutors opened a new Dora-Nordhausen trial, this one called the Essen-Dora trial. An SS guard, a Gestapo official, and the chief of security for the V-2 were all charged with war crimes that took place while V-weapons were being built in the Mittelwerk tunnel complex. Mittelwerk general manager and former Paperclip scientist Georg Rickhey was called as a witness, as was Wernher von Braun. Rickhey, who lived in Germany, took the stand. He testified under oath that he did not know about the Dora-Nordhausen concentration camp; that he learned about it after the war. “I don’t know much more because they were secret [concentration] camps,” Rickhey told the court. “It was a secret commando group in charge. Eyes only. There were bad catastrophic conditions [at Nordhausen] but I learned about this only after the war.” This was an absurd misrepresentation of the truth. Back in America, NASA general counsel refused to send the star of their space program to Germany; this would open Pandora’s box. Instead, they allowed von Braun to deliver oral testimony at a West German consulate in the United States. As a venue, NASA lawyers suggested New Orleans, Louisiana—a place about as far away from the media glare as there was. Representing the Sovietbloc survivors of Dora-Nordhausen was an East German lawyer by the name of Dr. Friedrich Kaul. Upon learning that von Braun would not be coming to Germany, Dr. Kaul arranged to travel to New Orleans to take von Braun’s testimony himself. Kaul was a supremely skillful lawyer, and he had information on von Braun that was damaging. According to Michael J. Neufeld, the U.S. government knew that Dr. Kaul had served as legal adviser on Die Gefrorenen Blitze, and that Kaul’s goal in interviewing von Braun was “to broadcast the connection between the rocket engineer, the SS and the concentration camps.” NASA’s moon program would never survive that kind of publicity, and the State Department denied Dr. Friedrich Kaul a visa. Instead, at the courthouse in Louisiana, von Braun answered questions put to him by a German judge.

As the U.S. Army had done with the 1947 Nordhausen trial, the government sealed von Braun’s testimony. Word leaked to the news media that von Braun had been deposed for a war crimes trial, causing von Braun to issue a brief statement on the matter. He said he had “nothing to hide, and I am not implicated.” When a reporter asked if there had been any concentration camp prisoners used as slave laborers at Peenemünde, von Braun said no. The judge prosecuting the Essen-Dora trial also took the testimony of General Dornberger, in Mexico, where the now-retired Dornberger spent winters with his wife. Some months later, von Braun and Dornberger corresponded about the matter. “In regards to the testimony, fortunately I too have heard nothing more,” wrote von Braun. No news was good news for both men. After the Apollo 11 moon landing in July 1969, columnist Drew Pearson—whose fierce exposés of Major General Dr. Walter Schreiber had helped to banish the man from America—wrote in his column that von Braun had been a member of the SS. But von Braun’s glory had reached epic proportions, and Pearson’s article went by relatively unnoticed. Von Braun was an American hero. Citizens all across the nation showered him with praise, glory, and the confetti of ticker-tape parades. After the Apollo space program ended, von Braun moved into the private sector. In his new life as a defense contractor, he traveled the world and met its leaders, including Indira Gandhi, the Shah of Iran, and Crown Prince Juan Carlos of Spain. In 1973, he decided to take up flying, and in June of that year he applied to get his pilot’s license with the Federal Aviation Administration. This required a physical and a body X-ray, which revealed a dark shadow on his kidney. Von Braun had terminal cancer but would live for another four years. The year before he died, there was a motion inside the Ford White House to award Wernher von Braun the Presidential Medal of Freedom. The idea almost passed until one of President Ford’s senior advisers, David Gergen, famously wrote, in a note passed to colleagues, “Sorry, but I can’t support the idea of giving [the] medal of freedom to [a] former Nazi whose V-2 was fired into over [sic] 3000 British and Belgian cities. He has given valuable service to the US since, but frankly he has gotten as good as he has given.” Von Braun was awarded the Medal of Science instead. He died on June 16, 1977.

Dr. Hubertus Strughold, though never as famous as Wernher von Braun, played an equally vital role in the U.S. space program—in the field of medicine. In November 1948, fifteen months after Strughold arrived at the School of Aviation Medicine at Randolph Air Force Base, he and Commandant Harry Armstrong hosted the first ever U.S. military panel discussion on biology in space. Strughold served as professional adviser to Armstrong at the SAM, and he oversaw the work of approximately thirty-four German colleagues under Operation Paperclip contracts there. Strughold’s broader vision, which he shared with Armstrong, was to create a space medicine program for the U.S. Air Force. In 1948 the notion of human space flight was still considered science fiction by most. But Strughold’s team had recently conducted a groundbreaking experiment with von Braun’s rocket team at White Sands, the results of which they desired to make public. On June 11, 1948, a nine-pound rhesus monkey named Albert was strapped into a harness inside the nose cone of a V-2 rocket and jettisoned into space. Albert’s pressurized space capsule, its harness and its cage, had been designed by Dr. Strughold and his team. The V-2 rocket carrying Albert traveled to an altitude of 39 miles. Albert died of suffocation during the six-minute flight, but for Dr. Strughold, the monkey’s voyage signified the momentous first step toward human space flight. Armstrong and Strughold’s biology in space panel was cosponsored by the air surgeon, the National Research Council, and the medical research laboratory at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Wright Lab. For the first time ever in America, space medicine was now being looked at as a legitimate military science. Two months later, in January 1949, Armstrong and Strughold decided it was time to seek funding for a new department inside the SAM dedicated solely to researching space medicine. For this, Armstrong later explained, “we needed much larger accommodations, more space and facilities and much more sophisticated research equipment.” Armstrong traveled to Washington, D.C., to sell the idea to Congress and to explain that he and Dr. Strughold needed between fifteen and twenty years’ lead time to do the necessary research to prepare humans for space travel. Congress approved Armstrong’s idea. “There were no wild headlines,” Armstrong later explained. The Department of Space Medicine at the SAM opened with little fanfare on February 9, 1949. “I appointed myself Director", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:Operation Paperclip_cleaned.txt:297:969121e99cfa", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 6210, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "Operation Paperclip_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/031622104X", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "Operation Paperclip_cleaned", "chunk_index": 298, "text": "more space and facilities and much more sophisticated research equipment.” Armstrong traveled to Washington, D.C., to sell the idea to Congress and to explain that he and Dr. Strughold needed between fifteen and twenty years’ lead time to do the necessary research to prepare humans for space travel.

The Department of Space Medicine at the SAM opened with little fanfare on February 9, 1949. “I appointed myself Director of the new aerospace laboratory… not Dr. Strughold since there were [sic] still some lingering enmity toward the Germans,” Armstrong told an air force historian in 1976. But just a few months after the department officially opened, Armstrong was transferred to the Pentagon to serve as surgeon general of the U.S. Air Force. The man he was replacing was his long-time mentor, Major General Malcolm Grow. Back in Texas, Dr. Strughold was promoted to the position of scientific director of the Department of Space Medicine at SAM. Strughold continued to oversee the professional activities of the Paperclip scientists. He also played an active role in further recruiting endeavors. In the fall of 1949, he traveled to Germany to try to facilitate the hiring of Dr. Siegfried Ruff, Strughold’s long-time colleague and one of the doctors tried—and acquitted—at the Nuremberg doctors’ trial. Siegfried Ruff was the Luftwaffe doctor who had overseen Rascher’s medical murder experiments at Dachau. Information about Ruff’s recruitment was leaked to journalist Drew Pearson, who allegedly threatened to tell the president if Dr. Ruff came to the United States as part of Operation Paperclip. Ruff’s contract never materialized. A second defendant acquitted at the Nuremberg doctors’ trial was able to secure a Paperclip contract with Dr. Strughold’s help. Konrad Schäfer, the “thirst and thirst quenching” expert who had “participated in the planning and execution of the saltwater experiments” at Dachau, arrived at the School of Aviation Medicine in August 1949. In Texas, Schäfer’s military research was supervised by Dr. Strughold and an air force captain named Seymour Schwartz. During Schäfer’s time at SAM, he worked in three departments: internal medicine, radiobiology and pharmacology. One of his research projects involved an effort to make Mississippi River water drinkable. Konrad Schäfer’s American supervisor found him inept. “The scientist [Schäfer] has been singularly unsuccessful in producing any finished work and has displayed very little real scientific acumen,” Captain Schwartz wrote. “The experience of this Headquarters indicates that this man is a most ineffective research worker and on the basis of his performance here his future worth to the U.S. Armed Forces is nil.” In a letter to the director of intelligence at U.S. Air Force headquarters in Washington, D.C., in March 1951, Captain Schwartz requested that Schäfer’s Paperclip contract be terminated and that he be sent back to Germany. The air force terminated Schäfer’s contract, but the German doctor refused to", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:Operation Paperclip_cleaned.txt:298:d194f85d9466", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 6211, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "Operation Paperclip_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/031622104X", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "Operation Paperclip_cleaned", "chunk_index": 299, "text": "experience of this Headquarters indicates that this man is a most ineffective research worker and on the basis of his performance here his future worth to the U.S. Armed Forces is nil.” In a letter to the director of intelligence at U.S. Air Force headquarters in Washington, D.C., in March 1951, Captain Schwartz requested that Schäfer’s Paperclip contract be terminated and that he be sent back to Germany. The air force terminated Schäfer’s contract, but the German doctor refused to leave the United States. Thanks to expedited protocols put in place by the JIOA, Schäfer was already in possession of a valid U.S. immigration visa by the time it was determined that he was incompetent. He moved to New York City to work in the private sector. In the early 1950s, the School of Aviation Medicine and its Department of Space Medicine swiftly gained momentum as formidable medical research laboratories. The Journal of Aviation Medicine began publishing articles on space medicine, including ones written by Paperclip scientists and covering topics like weightlessness, urinating in zero gravity, and the effects of cosmic radiation on humans. There was also classified military research going on at the SAM, including experiments involving human test subjects. In January 1994, President Clinton created the Advisory Committee on Human Radiation Experiments to investigate and report on the use of human beings in medical research related to Cold War atomic tests. The Advisory Committee found many of these experiments to be criminal and to be in violation of the Nuremberg Code, including studies conducted by German doctors with the SAM. Starting in 1951, the Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) and the Department of Defense conducted aboveground nuclear weapons tests in the Nevada desert, at a facility called the Nevada Proving Ground and later renamed the Nevada Test Site. The experiments were designed to determine how soldiers and airmen would perform on the nuclear battlefield. The AEC and the DoD agreed that subjecting soldiers to blast and radiation effects of various-sized atomic bombs was required to accurately prepare for a nuclear war. Colonel John E. Pickering was the director of medical research at the SAM in the early 1950s. In this capacity, Pickering oversaw the research of two German doctors working on a group of AEC studies involving “flashblindness”—the temporary or permanent blindness caused by looking at a nuclear weapon during detonation. According to testimony Colonel Pickering gave to the Advisory Committee in 1994, one set of flashblindness studies had been suggested by Dr. Strughold. Pickering said Strughold was interested in learning about permanent eye damage based on the fact that he himself had been partially blinded in one eye as a boy after watching a solar eclipse with a faulty viewing glass. “That’s the thing that gave us curiosity,” Pickering recalled of Strughold’s accident.

Among the Paperclip scientists who carried out the initial flashblindness studies were Heinrich Rose and Konrad Büttner. Both men had been working for the U.S. government since the fall of 1945, when Dr. Strughold first recommended them for employment at the Army Air Forces Aero Medical Center in Heidelberg. And like so many of Strughold’s close Luftwaffe colleagues, Rose and Büttner had been Nazi ideologues during the war. Both men were long-term members of the Nazi Party and also members of the SA. For the first set of flashblindness studies, Rose and Büttner’s test subjects were large pigs. The two doctors calculated that the flash of a 20-kiloton atomic bomb could produce retinal burns as far a s forty miles from ground zero. As the atomic tests progressed, the Atomic Energy Commission sought more specific data regarding humans. In the fall of 1951, for an atomic test series called Operation Buster-Jangle, soldier volunteers were asked to stare at a nuclear explosion from varying distances. Crew flying in C-54 aircraft approximately nine miles from ground zero were told to look out the windows of the airplane when the bomb went off. Some wore protective eye goggles while others did not. “No visual handicaps” were reported, according to Pickering. In the spring of 1952, for an atomic test series called Operation Tumbler-Snapper, a trailer was set up on the Nevada desert floor, with porthole-like windows at viewing range. Soldier volunteers were asked to sit in front of the windows and stare at the nuclear explosion. The distance from ground zero was also approximately nine miles, only this time the soldiers were at blast level. One of the volunteers in the viewing trailer was Colonel Pickering, who said that some of the human test subjects were given protective eye goggles to wear but others were asked to observe the fireball with the naked eye. Two soldiers had their eyeballs burned and the trailer tests were suspended. In the spring of 1953, for an atomic test series called Operation Upshot-Knothole, soldier volunteers were asked to perform duck-and-cover drills inside five-foot-deep trenches that had been dug into the desert floor several miles from ground zero. The men were specifically instructed not to look at the atomic blast. But curiosity got the better of at least one young officer, a twenty-two-yearold lieutenant identified in declassified records as “S.H.” Instead of facing away from the blast, the lieutenant looked over his left shoulder in the direction of the atomic bomb when it", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:Operation Paperclip_cleaned.txt:300:e9dd28f9d973", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 6213, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "Operation Paperclip_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/031622104X", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "Operation Paperclip_cleaned", "chunk_index": 301, "text": "Upshot-Knothole, soldier volunteers were asked to perform duck-and-cover drills inside five-foot-deep trenches that had been dug into the desert floor several miles from ground zero.

Because light enters the eye through the cornea and is refracted when it hits the lens, Pickering explained, images are flipped upside down. As a result, the image of an inverted nuclear fireball was seared on the lieutenant’s retina “forever,” leaving what Pickering described as “probably one of the most beautiful images of a fireball you’d ever see in your life.” Pickering said that doctors at the SAM kept a photograph of the man’s eyeball for their collection. The Advisory Committee determined that the SAM continued its classified flashblindness studies until at least 1962 but that most of the records had been lost or destroyed. Dr. Strughold’s personal research efforts remained focused on space medicine. Monkey astronaut rocket tests at White Sands progressed. On June 19, 1949, a monkey named Albert II was blasted off into space. During that flight, Strughold and his team monitored Albert II’s vitals as the V-2 carried him past the Kármán line—the point at which outer space begins—and reached an altitude of 83 miles. Albert II died back on Earth, on impact, when his parachute failed to open. By 1952, Strughold had succeeded in convincing the air force to fund the construction of a sealed chamber, or capsule, to be used for space medicine research on humans. The cabin was designed by fellow Paperclip scientist Fritz Haber, brother of Heinz Haber, and completed in 1954. The sealed chamber was one hundred cubic square feet, with a single seat and an instrument panel, and was meant to duplicate the conditions that an astronaut would experience during a voyage to the moon. The first human test was conducted in March 1956, when an airman named D. F. Smith spent twenty-four hours inside the chamber, performing various tasks while being monitored by Strughold and his team. Approximately two years later, in February 1958, pilot Donald G. Farrell, a twenty-three-year-old native of the Bronx chosen from a pool of rigorously screened airmen, stepped into the chamber for seven consecutive days and nights. This time period, Strughold explained, was inspired by Jules Verne’s prediction of how long it would take for a spaceship to get to the moon.

During the test, Strughold and Hans-Georg Clamann, Strughold’s former assistant during the Luftwaffe years, as well as two air force colleagues, monitored Donald Farrell’s vitals and his ability to perform tasks. The space capsule simulator test with airman Donald Farrell attracted all kinds of media attention. On the seventh and final day, Texas senator Lyndon B. Johnson stopped by the School of Aviation Medicine to personally escort Farrell out of the chamber and join him at a press conference. Dr. Strughold stood by Farrell’s side, as did General Otis Benson—the man who had tried, and failed, to find Major General Dr. Walter Schreiber a teaching position so he could remain in America. Benson singled out Strughold for his excellent work “in the name of medical science.” So excited was Lyndon Johnson by the event that he flew Dr. Strughold and his team to Washington, D.C., to attend a luncheon with seventy congressmen, the secretary of the air force, and a half-dozen four-star generals. Strughold later recalled the event: “After the soup, [Lyndon] Johnson asked me to give a five minute talk about the scope of space medicine and the meaning of the experiment.” Hubertus Strughold, like Wernher von Braun and Walter Dornberger, was now an accepted member of the U.S. military scientific elite. But there was a bump in the road. In May 1958, Time magazine featured a piece about Strughold, showering him with praise as America’s space medicine research pioneer. In response, the widely read Saturday Review published an editorial by Julian Bach Jr., a former war correspondent for the Army Talks series of pamphlets for GIs, and “the first American correspondent to report in the general press on medical experiments on human beings by Nazi doctors during World War II.” Bach’s editorial was called “Himmler the Scientist.” In it, the war correspondent reminded the public of the human experiments that the Nazi doctors had conducted on prisoners in concentration camps. “The German doctors carving them up were medical men of stature in many cases,” wrote Bach. “Only the fewest were quacks.” Bach correctly linked Strughold to the freezing experiments at Dachau, stating that, at minimum, he “had knowledge of them.” This was the first time the public had heard anything about Dr. Strughold having knowledge of the medical murder experiments, a fact he had previously been able to keep hidden. The article prompted an investigation at the federal level. Because Strughold had become a U.S. citizen two years prior, in 1956, the Immigration and Naturalization Service", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:Operation Paperclip_cleaned.txt:302:bd703f8692ba", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 6215, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "Operation Paperclip_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/031622104X", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "Operation Paperclip_cleaned", "chunk_index": 303, "text": "“Only the fewest were quacks.” Bach correctly linked Strughold to the freezing experiments at Dachau, stating that, at minimum, he “had knowledge of them.” This was the first time the public had heard anything about Dr. Strughold having knowledge of the medical murder experiments, a fact he had previously been able to keep hidden. The article prompted an investigation at the federal level. Because Strughold had become a U.S. citizen two years prior, in 1956, the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) was now compelled to investigate. But after checking with the air force, the INS released a statement saying that Strughold had been “appropriately investigated” before becoming a U.S. citizen. The INS had not been shown Strughold’s OMGUS security report or his classified dossier. If it had been, INS would have learned that military intelligence had concluded that Strughold’s “successful career under Hitler would seem to indicate that he must be in full accord with Nazism.” In October 1958, the twenty-ninth meeting of the Aero Medical Association convened in San Antonio, Texas, for a daylong symposium, “Aviation Medicine on the Threshold of Space.” The group’s first international convention had taken place at the Waldorf-Astoria hotel twenty-one years before. Dr. Strughold and Harry Armstrong had both been in attendance. Here they were together again: Armstrong and Strughold were co-hosts of the event. General Dornberger delivered a speech. Eleven of the forty-seven scientists in attendance had been brought to America from Germany as part of Operation Paperclip. They were American citizens now. A prolific writer, Strughold authored papers and journals, sometimes more than a dozen in a year. He had contributed a piece about space cabins to the Collier’s magazine series. He created new, space-related nomenclature, including the words “bioastronautics,” “gravisphere,” “ecosphere,” and “astrobiology.” He studied jet lag—how the body responds to flight—and wrote a book about his findings, Your Body Clock. In 1964, he was interviewed by the space writer and journalist Shirley Thomas for her eight-volume series Men of Space. Now, with nearly two decades of distance between himself and his Nazi past, and with so many accolades to his name, Strughold began to construct a fictional past for himself, one in which he had actually been an opponent of the Nazis. People began to look harder into the past. On September 3, 1973, Simon Wiesenthal, a freelance Nazi hunter who had played a role in the capture of Adolf Eichmann, wrote to Dr. Adalbert Rückerl, director of the Central Office of the State Justice Administration for the Investigation of National Socialist Crimes, in Ludwigsburg, Germany. Dr. Adalbert Rückerl told Simon Wiesenthal that he would look into it. A few months later, Rückerl wrote back to Wiesenthal to say that a comprehensive investigation had been done and that the Central Office could not find any direct evidence of Strughold’s personal participation in the medical crimes. Rückerl provided Wiesenthal with a", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:Operation Paperclip_cleaned.txt:303:750edaeb9331", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 6216, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "Operation Paperclip_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/031622104X", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "Operation Paperclip_cleaned", "chunk_index": 304, "text": "Eichmann, wrote to Dr. Adalbert Rückerl, director of the Central Office of the State Justice Administration for the Investigation of National Socialist Crimes, in Ludwigsburg, Germany.

A few months later, Rückerl wrote back to Wiesenthal to say that a comprehensive investigation had been done and that the Central Office could not find any direct evidence of Strughold’s personal participation in the medical crimes. Rückerl provided Wiesenthal with a copy of the documents pertaining to the conference, “Medical Problems of Sea Distress and Winter Distress,” at the Hotel Deutscher Hof in Nuremberg in 1942, including the travel expenses that Strughold had submitted and the amount he was paid to attend. The Luftwaffe doctors in attendance had discussed the medical data of murdered people. But knowledge was not a crime, and there was no further action for the Central Office of the State Justice Administration to take, Rückerl said. A few months later, toward the end of 1973, the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service announced that it was investigating Strughold and thirty-four other long-dormant cases of Nazi war criminal suspects living in the United States. That Strughold’s name was on the list, which was published in the New York Times, came as a shock to him. Strughold rehearsed a succinct response for reporters, the same as von Braun had when allegations arose. “I was cleared before I came here, before I was hired,” Strughold said. Leaders of Jewish groups sprang into action, and Charles R. Allen Jr., the former senior editor of The Nation, writing for Jewish Currents, presented evidence about Strughold’s knowledge of human experiments. Allen had acquired the first public copy of the proceedings of the Nuremberg medical conference at the Hotel Deutscher Hof in 1942, which included a list of those in attendance. On this list were five other Nazi doctors who had worked in America under Operation Paperclip—Major General Walter Schreiber, Konrad Schäfer, Hans-Georg Clamann, Konrad Büttner, and Theodor Benzinger—but neither Charles R. Allen Jr. nor anyone else involved in the Strughold exposé appears to have recognized any of these names. Twenty years prior, Major General Walter Schreiber had been fired from the SAM and banished to Argentina, and Konrad Schäfer had been fired from the SAM and moved to New York. But when this story broke in 1973, Hans-Georg Clamann, Konrad Büttner, and Theodor Benzinger had all been gainfully employed by the U.S. government for decades and were now living the American dream. The cloud of suspicion hung over Strughold. Ralph Blumenthal wrote a follow-up article in the New York Times, in November of 1974, describing the freezing experiments in detail. “Victims were forced to remain naked outdoors or in tanks of ice water. Tests were made periodically as they were freezing to death… the victims suffered agonizing deaths, after which they were dissected for", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:Operation Paperclip_cleaned.txt:304:31ee9d26254b", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 6217, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "Operation Paperclip_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/031622104X", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "Operation Paperclip_cleaned", "chunk_index": 305, "text": "had all been gainfully employed by the U.S. government for decades and were now living the American dream.

Tests were made periodically as they were freezing to death… the victims suffered agonizing deaths, after which they were dissected for data.” INS director Leonard Chapman made inquiries with the U.S. Air Force and was told that there was “no derogatory information” on Strughold. The case was closed, yet again. Now more than ever Strughold felt the need to promote the fiction that he was anti-Nazi. In an air force oral history interview that took place two days after Blumenthal’s piece ran in the New York Times, Strughold told interviewer James C. Hasdorff that during the war he constantly feared for his life. He said that he had been written up on Hitler’s “so-called enemy list.” Strughold insisted that at one point, shortly after the attempted assassination of Hitler by Count Claus von Stauffenberg, in July 1944, he, Strughold, had to go into hiding because he was receiving death threats—that he went from farmhouse to farmhouse until it was finally “safe to return to Berlin.” This was an absurd distortion of reality. In the months after the Stauffenberg incident, in the winter of 1945, Hubertus Strughold had been promoted to full colonel in the Luftwaffe reserves. Three years passed. The spotlight moved away. In a ceremony on January 19, 1977, a bronze plaque bearing a portrait of Dr. Hubertus Strughold was unveiled in San Antonio, Texas, in the foyer at the Aeromedical Library at the School of Aerospace Medicine. The library, which was the largest medical library in the U.S. Air Force, was being dedicated to Dr. Hubertus Strughold, the Father of Space Medicine. The air force promised that Strughold’s bronze plaque “will be permanently displayed in the foyer of the library.” But permanence is impossible to predict. Only time tells what lasts. In the 1960s, what Operation Paperclip left behind in the country it recruited from reveals contradictory truths about the program’s legacy. A watershed event occurred in 1963 when the West German courts opened the Frankfurt Auschwitz trial. This was the first large-scale public trial of Holocaust perpetrators to take place inside Germany. There had been one Auschwitz trial previously, in Cracow, Poland, in 1947, in which a number of camp functionaries were tried, including Auschwitz commandant Rudolf Höss, who was sentenced to death and hanged. But before the Frankfurt Auschwitz trial, which ran through 1965, Germany had not conducted any major war crimes trials of its own. The Nuremberg trials, of course, were presided over by the Allied forces.

But before the Frankfurt Auschwitz trial, which ran through 1965, Germany had not conducted any major war crimes trials of its own. The Nuremberg trials, of course, were presided over by the Allied forces. At the Frankfurt Auschwitz trial, 360 witnesses from 19 countries, including 211 Auschwitz survivors, would confront the accused. The judges hearing the case were all Germans. Throughout the 1950s, Germany’s political and legal elite had opposed holding these kinds of trials for a variety of reasons, but mostly because it would likely generate additional trials. Just as it behooved U.S. military intelligence to keep the details of Operation Paperclip a secret, so it went for many German jurists. Thousand of their fellow citizens had committed heinous crimes during the war and were now living perfectly normal and sometimes very productive lives. But in 1963, with the trial under way, for the first time since 1945 people in Germany were openly talking about gas chambers, death camps, and the Holocaust. “The trial was triggered by a letter I received,” recalled Hermann Langbein, the secretary of the International Auschwitz Committee. “It was mailed to me by an Auschwitz survivor. A German [named] Rögner.” At Auschwitz, where both Langbein and Rögner had been prisoners, the SS guards had made Rögner a kapo—someone who supervised slave laborers. “He was a kapo in an electrical detail,” explained Langbein, “a decent kapo. There were some decent kapos there [at Auschwitz].” Boger was a loaded name to anyone who had survived Auschwitz. Survivors knew Boger as the Tiger of Auschwitz. Wilhelm Boger was a man of indisputable evil. Witnesses watched him murder children on the train ramps with his own hands. In Rögner’s letter to Langbein, he said that he’d filed murder charges against Boger with the German authorities in Stuttgart. In the spring of 1958, in his capacity as the secretary of the International Auschwitz Committee, Hermann Langbein followed up on Rögner’s tip and discovered that Boger was working as an accountant in a town outside Stuttgart. There, the Tiger of Auschwitz lived with his wife and children as a family man. “Bringing the man to justice was one long obstacle course,” said Hermann Langbein. But finally, after several months of delays, Boger was arrested. Richard Baer, the last commandant of Auschwitz, all of the former Auschwitz functionaries had been leading normal lives using their own names.

Auschwitz adjunct Robert Mulka was working as a merchant in Hamburg; at the death camp, Mulka had served as Rudolph Höss’s right-hand man. Josef Klehr was living in Braunschweig, working at an auto body shop called Büssing & Sons; Klehr had been a medical orderly at Auschwitz and had killed thousands with lethal injections to the heart. Oswald Kaduk was living in Berlin working in a nursing home; at Auschwitz Kaduk beat people to death with his boot. SS pharmacist Dr. Victor Capesius was living in Göppingen, a wealthy pharmacy and beauty shop owner; at Auschwitz, Capesius had assisted the notorious Dr. Mengele in selecting individuals for medical experiments and had managed the death camp’s supply of Zyklon B. With the actions of all these men under scrutiny at the Frankfurt Auschwitz trial, Germany faced its past through the lens of its own jurists, not American judges. Many young Germans paid attention and began to wonder how so many war criminals could have gotten away with so many war crimes for so long. More important to the Operation Paperclip legacy is that when Rögner filed his civil suit, he named another name: Dr. Otto Ambros. Ambros was listed as a criminal in Rögner’s complaint because he had been general manager of IG Farben’s Buna factory at Auschwitz. German prosecutors looked into the Ambros case and saw that Ambros had already been tried and convicted of war crimes at Nuremberg and that he had served two years and five and a half months in Landsberg Prison. They decided not to press charges against him a second time. In December 1963, however, Ambros was called to testify at the trial, which was held in the Römer, Frankfurt’s town hall. This brought Ambros into the limelight once again. By 1964, Ambros had been a free man for thirteen years. He was an extremely wealthy, successful businessman. He socialized in Berlin among captains of industry and the professional elite. When the Frankfurt Auschwitz trial started, he was a board member of numerous major corporations in Germany, including AEG (Allgemeine Elekrizitats Gesellschaft), Germany’s General Electric; Hibernia Mining Company; and SKW (Süddeutsche Kalkstickstoff-Werke AG), a chemical company. On the witness stand at the Frankfurt Auschwitz trial, Ambros gave testimony that contradicted statements he had made during his own trial at Nuremberg in 1947. He also said that the conditions at the Auschwitz Buna factory had been “cozy,” and that the workers had enjoyed “good hospitality,” which many Auschwitz survivors found appalling in its offensiveness. While contradictory statements might have gone unnoticed by Frankfurt’s judges and jurors,", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:Operation Paperclip_cleaned.txt:307:d1faa0908de9", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 6220, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "Operation Paperclip_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/031622104X", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "Operation Paperclip_cleaned", "chunk_index": 308, "text": "Hibernia Mining Company; and SKW (Süddeutsche Kalkstickstoff-Werke AG), a chemical company.

He also said that the conditions at the Auschwitz Buna factory had been “cozy,” and that the workers had enjoyed “good hospitality,” which many Auschwitz survivors found appalling in its offensiveness. While contradictory statements might have gone unnoticed by Frankfurt’s judges and jurors, there were a number of high-profile Israeli journalists in the courtroom who had become experts on the subject and caught Ambros’s lies. These journalists began at once to investigate Otto Ambros’s post-Nuremberg life. Here was a man who had been convicted of slavery and mass murder and had served very little time, considering the crimes. The Farben slaves at Auschwitz numbered sixty thousand, approximately thirty thousand of whom had been worked to death. The journalists covering the trial were outraged by what they discovered. Otto Ambros now sat on the board of directors of numerous private corporations, but he was also on the board of directors of five companies that were owned by the Federal Republic of Germany. The exorbitant fees Ambros commanded in these positions were being paid by the German taxpayer. An Israeli female journalist, identified in Bundesarchiv documents only as “Frau Deutschkren,” became so incensed by the arrogance and hubris she saw in Otto Ambros’s postwar life that she wrote a letter to the state minister of finance, Ludger Westrick. That the Federal Republic of Germany was paying a “consulting fee” of 12,000 deutschmarks—about $120, 000 in today’s dollars—to a convicted war criminal was shameful, Frau Deutschkren said. She demanded that Finance Minister Ludger Westrick meet with her. He agreed. Frau Deutschkren could not have known that Otto Ambros and Finance Minister Ludger Westrick were business colleagues and apparently on very friendly terms, as state archive correspondence reveals. After the meeting, Westrick promised to look into the matter. Instead, he told Ambros what was going on. In an effort to hold on to his lucrative and prestigious positions on company boards, Ambros produced a summary of the allegations against himself and his Nuremberg codefendants, written by his attorney, a Mr. Duvall. Ambros asked Finance Minister Westrick to circulate this apologia around the various boards on his behalf. “As a short summary of our case [shows] you will clearly find out we are innocent,” Ambros explained, referring to charges of slavery and genocide that he and his Farben colleagues were convicted of at Nuremberg. “I and my colleagues are the victims of the Third Reich,” Ambros insisted. “The former government utilized the success of synthetic rubber which they used to make a profit. If there had been anything against me, then I would have never been released by the American military.” U.S. High Commissioner John J. McCloy had", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:Operation Paperclip_cleaned.txt:308:55324ae5cad6", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 6221, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "Operation Paperclip_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/031622104X", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "Operation Paperclip_cleaned", "chunk_index": 309, "text": "clearly find out we are innocent,” Ambros explained, referring to charges of slavery and genocide that he and his Farben colleagues were convicted of at Nuremberg. “I and my colleagues are the victims of the Third Reich,” Ambros insisted. “The former government utilized the success of synthetic rubber which they used to make a profit. If there had been anything against me, then I would have never been released by the American military.” U.S. High Commissioner John J. McCloy had granted Ambros clemency under intense political pressure, a fact now being used by Ambros to suggest that he had been wrongly convicted at Nuremberg. In a letter dated April 25, 1964, Ambros reminded Finance Minister Westrick that after he had been released from Landsberg Prison in 1951, “You helped me get back on the boards.” For this, Ambros said he was grateful. “I see it as an honor and a duty to [remain] there. I do this for pure altruistic reasons. I appreciate anything you can do.” In turn, Finance Minister Westrick wrote letters to the various boards on Ambros’s behalf. “Ambros was chosen for the board because of exceptional talent,” Westrick said. “In his field he is as wanted as Wernher von Braun. Everyone wants him. He can get a job anywhere he wants, anywhere in the world.” The Israeli journalists refused to let up on Otto Ambros. They continued to write news stories about him, making it increasingly difficult for both the Federal Republic of Germany and the publicly traded companies on whose boards Ambros sat to maintain business associations with him. “Former War Criminal Found Refuge in Switzerland,” read a headline on June 6, 1964. The story detailed time that Ambros spent in the Swiss village of Pura. Ambros, furious, submitted a “statement of facts” to Labor Ministry state secretary, Ludwig Kattenstroth, in response. “I did not hide myself in Pura,” Ambros wrote. “It is my holiday home. And I have to say that when I bought the parcel there [in 1956] I informed the Swiss government by handing over the judgment at Nuremberg. I am only there for holidays… my children go there, and my friends. After consulting with my lawyer, I will never go back.” Then came the blaming. “The whole affair,” wrote Ambros, “has to be seen in the shadow of the Frankfurt trial. A certain faction of the press is trying to blame me.” The subtext was that “the Jews” were trying to blame him. Ambros wrote, “I won’t name them [publicly] because I don’t want to tip off any journalists who might cause trouble with my friends. You know about W. R. Grace in New York… and I hope I can stay with Hibernia Company. Concerning the firms in Israel,” Ambros wrote, “stating their names publicly would be very embarrassing because they are [run by] very public, well-respected persons in public positions", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:Operation Paperclip_cleaned.txt:309:e8d8c903cab6", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 6222, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "Operation Paperclip_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/031622104X", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "Operation Paperclip_cleaned", "chunk_index": 310, "text": "me.” The subtext was that “the Jews” were trying to blame him.

Concerning the firms in Israel,” Ambros wrote, “stating their names publicly would be very embarrassing because they are [run by] very public, well-respected persons in public positions that have actually been at my home and are aware of my position, how I behaved during the Reich, and they accept this.” The “well-respected” public figures in Israel to whom Ambros referred have never been revealed. That Ambros also had worked for the American company W. R. Grace would take decades to come to light. When it did, in the early 1980s, the public would also learn that Otto Ambros worked as a consultant for the U.S. Department of Energy, formerly the Atomic Energy Commission, “to develop and operate a plant for the hydrogenation of coal in a scale of 4 million tons/year at the former IG Farben industrie.” That a convicted war criminal had been hired by the Department of Energy sparked indignation, and congressmen and journalists sought further details about Ambros’s U.S. government contract. In a statement to the press, the Department of Energy insisted that the paperwork had been lost. The scandal was brought to the attention of President Ronald Reagan. Letters on White House stationery reveal that Deputy National Security Adviser James W. Nance briefed Reagan about how it was that the U.S. government could have hired Otto Ambros. Nance’s argument to the president was that many others hired him. “Dr. Ambros had contacts with numerous officials from Allied countries,” wrote Nance. “Dr. Ambros was a consultant to companies such as Distillers Limited of England; Pechiney, the French chemical giant; and Dow Europe of Switzerland. He was also the chairman of Knoll, a pharmaceutical subsidiary of the well known chemical corporation BASF.” President Reagan requested further information from the Department of Energy on its Ambros contract. Nance told the president, “The DOE and/or ERDA [The Energy Research and Development Administration] do not have records that would answer the questions you asked in the detail you requested. However, with Dr. Ambros’ involvement in the company shown and his special knowledge in hydrogenation of coal, we know there were productive contacts between Dr. Ambros and U.S. energy officials.” Even the president of the United States could not get complete information about an Operation Paperclip legacy. The third act of Dr. Kurt Blome’s life contradicts the idea that the Soviets were desperately trying to hire Hitler’s former biological weapons maker. In February 1962, a group of Communist physicians from Karl Marx University, in Leipzig, East Germany, sent an open letter “to all the doctors and dentists living in", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:Operation Paperclip_cleaned.txt:310:4889e7a512b2", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 6223, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "Operation Paperclip_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/031622104X", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "Operation Paperclip_cleaned", "chunk_index": 311, "text": "there were productive contacts between Dr. Ambros and U.S. energy officials.” Even the president of the United States could not get complete information about an Operation Paperclip legacy. The third act of Dr. Kurt Blome’s life contradicts the idea that the Soviets were desperately trying to hire Hitler’s former biological weapons maker. In February 1962, a group of Communist physicians from Karl Marx University, in Leipzig, East Germany, sent an open letter “to all the doctors and dentists living in Dortmund,” as well as many widely distributed newspapers “regarding the matter of the Dortmund physician, Dr. Kurt Blome.” The letter listed the war crimes Blome had been accused of at the Nuremberg doctors’ trial and stated that everyone in the town of Dortmund should “know who he is and what he did to the Jewish people.” The Leipzig doctors identified the doctor in Dortmund as “the Deputy Surgeon General of the Third Reich.” They wrote that Western German medical colleagues should distance themselves “from this man who dares to call himself a doctor.” Blome was contacted by the East German radio station, Radio Berlin International, for comment. He agreed, and an interview was arranged for February 22, 1962. “I have read the two pages you have presented to me,” Blome told his interviewer on the appointed day. “During the war I got the task to prepare a serum, a vaccine, against a bacterial plague. This all started because [Major General] Dr. Schreiber told a lie. Schreiber is a pawn of the Russians. It’s a sworn lie.” Blome spent the rest of his radio time blaming Schreiber for his own misfortunes. He ended by pointing out his innocence; Blome reminded the radio announcer that he had endured a ten-month trial at Nuremberg. “I was acquitted on every point that there was,” Blome said. “The U.S. judges were not easy. They handed out seven death penalties and five lifelong imprisonments. If I had been guilty, they would have convicted me.” The allegations opened a subsequent investigation into Blome. Two weeks later, on April 4, 1962, the state’s attorney in Dortmund wrote to the Central Office of the State Justice Administration for the Investigation of National Socialist Crimes to see if there was anything on Dr. Kurt Blome. The state’s attorney put together a dossier on Blome, with most of the focus on a letter Blome had written on November 18, 1942, to Reich Governor (Reichsstatthalter) Arthur Karl Greiser, mayor of a Polish area near Posen and subsequently executed for war crimes. The subject matter was Sonderbehandlung, or “special treatment,” of Poles with tuberculosis. By now, in 1962, it had been established that Sonderbehandlung was a Nazi euphemism for extermination. In this 1942 correspondence, Blome and Greiser agreed that the best way to deal with this group of tubercular Poles being discussed was to give them “special treatment.” But Blome also raises “a", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:Operation Paperclip_cleaned.txt:311:c77a6911cbcd", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 6224, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "Operation Paperclip_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/031622104X", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "Operation Paperclip_cleaned", "chunk_index": 312, "text": "Reich Governor (Reichsstatthalter) Arthur Karl Greiser, mayor of a Polish area near Posen and subsequently executed for war crimes.

In this 1942 correspondence, Blome and Greiser agreed that the best way to deal with this group of tubercular Poles being discussed was to give them “special treatment.” But Blome also raises “a problem” that had to be dealt with—namely, that if these tubercular Poles were to be exterminated, “[t]he general perception by relatives would be that something unorthodox is going on.” Blome reminds Reich Governor Greiser that the group they are proposing special treatment for totals approximately thirtyfive thousand people. Blome was called in to an interview with the state’s attorney. “I am aware that there is an investigation,” Blome said. “My position is that this has already been investigated by the Americans.” Dr. Blome then made the same argument he had used at Nuremberg as a defendant in the doctors’ trial: that he may have recommended the extermination of thirty-five thousand Poles as a course of action, but that there was no proof that that action ever took place. Intent, Blome maintained, is not a crime. “Furthermore,” Blome told investigators, “I want to add that I put the blame on [Major General Dr. Walter] Schreiber based on what I learned at the trial.” Blome said that Dr. Schreiber was the true murderer and that he had framed Dr. Blome to deflect the guilt away from himself. After several days of consideration, on May 21, 1962, the state’s attorney placed the investigation of Dr. Blome on hold. Blome continued to practice medicine in Dortmund and the case against him was never reopened. Three years later, Blome was dead. “He died of emphysema,” says his son, who also reports that, by the time of his father’s death, Dr. Kurt Blome was alone and estranged from the world. Albert Speer served all twenty years of his sentence at Spandau Prison outside Berlin, despite the efforts by John J. McCloy, as U.S. High Commissioner for Germany, to get Speer released earlier. In 1956 McCloy wrote to Speer’s wife, Margarete, “I have a very strong conviction that your husband should be released and would be very happy if I could do anything to expedite such a release.” In prison Speer secretly worked on the memoirs he would publish upon his release. On pieces of toilet paper, cigarette wrappers, and paper scraps he jotted down recollections of his days working alongside Hitler and the inner circle. It was illegal to write and send unscreened notes out of Spandau, so Speer had his writing smuggled out by two sympathetic Dutch Red Cross nurses.

It was illegal to write and send unscreened notes out of Spandau, so Speer had his writing smuggled out by two sympathetic Dutch Red Cross nurses. The notes were delivered to Speer’s old friend and colleague Rudolf Wolters, a diehard Hitler loyalist living in Berlin. Over the course of twenty years Wolters painstakingly typed up tens of thousands of these individual paper scraps that Speer continued to send to him. After twenty years they amounted to a thousand-page manuscript, which Wolters turned over to Speer upon Speer’s release. With the advance payments Speer received on his memoirs—he would write two, Inside the Third Reich and Spandau: The Secret Diaries—Speer became a wealthy man once again. He earned a reported 680,000 deutschmarks from Die Welt for serialization rights, and a reported $350,000 (roughly $2.4 million in 2013) advance for English-language book rights. Albert Speer bought a sports car and embarked on a new life as a successful author. He never thanked or acknowledged Rudolf Wolters for his twenty years of work, at least not in his book and not publicly. A decade later, Speer defended this decision to his biographer, Gitta Sereny, saying “[I]t was for [Wolters’s] own protection.” Wolters’s son reported that when Wolters died, the last word he uttered was “Speer.” After Speer sent Wernher von Braun a copy of Spandau, von Braun wrote a letter to his old friend and former boss at the Reich’s Ministry of Armaments and War Production, pointing out how divergent their lives had been over the past twenty years. While Speer had been at Spandau Prison, von Braun’s star had risen steadily. He thanked Speer for the book. “How often I thought of you during those last twenty long years when so much was happening in my life,” wrote von Braun. When Siegfried Knemeyer learned that Albert Speer was out of prison, Knemeyer took a trip to visit his old friend in Germany. The last time the two men had seen each other was in Berlin in April 1945, when Knemeyer was helping Speer plot his escape to Greenland. In the years that Speer had been in prison, Knemeyer had been working for the United States—formerly the sworn enemy of both men. As an employee of the U.S. Air Force in the 1940s, 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s, Knemeyer worked on classified and unclassified projects, won awards, and rose up through the ranks. For the air force, he established the Pilot Factors Program, which coordinated technologies as aircraft went from subsonic to supersonic flight. Upon his retirement in 1977, Pentagon officials awarded Knemeyer their highest civilian award, the Distinguished Civilian Service Award.

Upon his retirement in 1977, Pentagon officials awarded Knemeyer their highest civilian award, the Distinguished Civilian Service Award. Knemeyer died of emphysema two years later, on April 11, 1979. His last wish was that his body be “immediately taken to a crematory” and that no funeral be held. “He served his native country, Germany, and his adopted country, America, with equal enthusiasm and dedication,” said his son Sigurd Knemeyer. To the end, Albert Speer denied that he had direct knowledge of the Holocaust. Sixty-seven years after interviewing Speer at the Ashcan interrogation facility in Luxembourg, John Dolibois still takes umbrage at this. “I asked [Speer] if he was at the Wannsee Conference at which Himmler announced the ‘Final Solution’ for eradicating Jews,” Dolibois explains. “In my opinion, anyone who was at that meeting could not say he knew nothing about extermination camps—like Auschwitz, Sobibor, Birkenau. Speer first denied being at Wannsee, then admitted [to me] he was there, but left before lunch and missed the important announcements. Others also asserted [Speer] was not telling the truth. I think he should have been hanged.” In the 1970s, several events led to a major shift in the American public’s perception of the Holocaust, Nazis, and the United States. A series of congressional oversight hearings were convened as a result of many high-profile cases of Nazi war criminals found living in America. The hearings drew attention to the fact that the Immigration and Naturalization Service had been negligent in its investigations of these individuals and in turn led to the creation of the Justice Department’s Office of Special Investigations. Then came the 1978 broadcast of NBC’s four-part miniseries Holocaust, which broke records for family viewing and made Americans who had never contemplated the Holocaust think seriously about what had happened in Nazi Germany and what the state-sponsored murder of six million people really meant. These events set the stage for a simple, fortuitous occurrence for a young Harvard law student named Eli Rosenbaum, the consequences of which would profoundly impact the Paperclip scientists who had something to hide. In 1980, Eli Rosenbaum was perusing book titles inside a Cambridge bookstore when he came across Dora: The Nazi Concentration Camp Where Modern Space Technology Was Born and 30,000 Prisoners Died, written by a former Dora prisoner, the French Resistance fighter Jean Michel. The narrative is detailed and revelatory in its brutal honesty. Jean Michel called his book an homage to the thirty thousand slave laborers who died building the V-2s.

The narrative is detailed and revelatory in its brutal honesty. Jean Michel called his book an homage to the thirty thousand slave laborers who died building the V-2s. He comments on the memoirs written by Wernher von Braun and General Dornberger, and the countless interviews given by many of the other V-2 scientists who worked under Operation Paperclip. None of these Germans, notes Michel, utters a word about Nordhausen. “I do not reproach these men with not having made public confessions after the war,” Michel writes. “I do not hold it against the scientists that they did not choose to be martyrs when they discovered the truth about the [death] camps. No, mine is a more modest objective. I make my stand solely against the monstrous distortion of history which, in silencing certain facts and glorifying others, has given birth to false, foul and suspect myths.” In that same Cambridge bookstore, on that same day, Eli Rosenbaum came across a second book about the V-2 rocket. This one was called The Rocket Team and was written by Frederick I. Ordway III and Mitchell R. Sharpe, with an introduction by Wernher von Braun. The book discusses and quotes the German scientists involved in the U.S. rocket program. In one part of the book, engineer Arthur Rudolph—praised as the developer of NASA’s Saturn V rocket program—shares his thoughts with the authors. Rudolph is not identified as having once been operations director at the Mittelwerk slave labor facility. Rudolph relates an anecdote from the war, concerning his dismay at being called away from a New Year’s Eve party in 1943–44 because of a problem with some of the V-2 rockets. An accompanying photograph shows a POW in striped prisoner pajamas moving rocket parts. Eli Rosenbaum had spent the previous summer working for the Department of Justice in its Office of Special Investigations. He knew that the Geneva Convention forbade nations from forcing prisoners of war to work on munitions. He had also just read about what went on in the Nordhausen tunnels in Jean Michel’s book Dora. Rosenbaum later recalled that he “was particularly offended by Rudolph’s taking umbrage at missing a gala party while slave laborers toiled.” The following year, after graduating from Harvard Law School, Rosenbaum started full-time work at the Department of Justice as a trial lawyer. He persuaded his boss, Neal M. Sher, to open an investigation into Arthur Rudolph. In September of 1982, Marianne Rudolph, the daughter of Arthur Rudolph, received an unexpected telephone call at her home in San Jose, California. It was the Department of Justice calling.

In September of 1982, Marianne Rudolph, the daughter of Arthur Rudolph, received an unexpected telephone call at her home in San Jose, California. It was the Department of Justice calling. They explained that they had been trying to reach her father, Arthur Rudolph, who apparently lived nearby, but that they had been unable to do so. Marianne Rudolph, who worked as an artist for NASA, told the caller that her parents were vacationing in Germany and would be back at the end of the month. The day after the Rudolphs returned, Arthur Rudolph received a registered letter in the mail from the Department of Justice, Office of Special Investigations. The letter stated that questions had been raised regarding Arthur Rudolph’s activities during the Second World War. Rudolph was asked to meet with DOJ officials at the San Jose Hyatt on October 13 and to bring any documents with him that he owned covering the period between 1933 and 1945. During this first meeting, which included Arthur Rudolph, OSI director Allan A. Ryan Jr., Deputy Director Neal M. Sher, and trial attorney Eli Rosenbaum, the interview lasted five hours. There were two central questions the lawyers wanted answered: Owing to what set of principles had Rudolph decided to join the Nazi Party, which he did in 1933, and what exactly did he know about the Nordhausen executions, specifically about the prisoners who had been hanged from a crane? DOJ lawyers Allen, Sher, and Rosenbaum had documents with them including the previously sealed testimony from the 1947 Dora-Nordhausen trial. These documents included pretrial investigative material regarding former Paperclip specialist Georg Rickhey. Among the documents was the interview that Rudolph gave, on June 2, 1947, to Major Eugene Smith of the U.S. Army Air Force. In that testimony, Rudolph had first said that he never saw any prisoners beaten or hanged. Later in the interview with Major Smith, Rudolph changed his story to say that he had been forced to watch the hangings but had nothing to do with them. During the San Jose Hyatt interview in 1982, the three Justice Department lawyers presented Rudolph with the drawing made by his former Nordhausen colleagues from Fort Bliss, the rocket engineers Günther Haukohl, Rudolph Schlidt, Hans Palaoro, and Erich Ball. This drawing illustrated the layout inside the tunnels and had been used as evidence in the Dora-Nordhausen trial. The Justice Department lawyers pointed out to Rudolph that there was a clear dotted line, labeled “Path of Overhead Crane Trolly [sic] On Which Men Were Hung.” The dotted line ran right by Rudolph’s office, which suggested that", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:Operation Paperclip_cleaned.txt:316:9ab323846c6d", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 6229, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "Operation Paperclip_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/031622104X", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "Operation Paperclip_cleaned", "chunk_index": 317, "text": "with the drawing made by his former Nordhausen colleagues from Fort Bliss, the rocket engineers Günther Haukohl, Rudolph Schlidt, Hans Palaoro, and Erich Ball.

The Justice Department lawyers pointed out to Rudolph that there was a clear dotted line, labeled “Path of Overhead Crane Trolly [sic] On Which Men Were Hung.” The dotted line ran right by Rudolph’s office, which suggested that it would have been impossible for Rudolph not to have seen the hangings. The lawyers asked why he had lied. They also asked Rudolph about testimony from the 1947 Dora-Nordhausen trial that revealed that, at the Mittelwerk tunnel complex, he received daily “prisoner strength reports which showed the number of prisoners available for work, the number of ‘new arrivals,’ and the number of people lost through sickness or death.’” They said that, clearly, Rudolph knew people were being worked to death and were being replaced by fresh bodies from the Dora-Nordhausen concentration camp. Back in Washington, D.C., the Justice Department put together its case. Four months later, on February 4, 1983, a second meeting took place at the San Jose Hyatt, and, shortly thereafter, Rudolph received a letter from the Justice Department in the mail. “Certain preliminary decisions have now been made,” wrote Neal Sher. “I would be prepared to discuss these decisions, as well as the evidence amassed to date, with an attorney authorized to represent your interest.” The government stated intentions to pursue its case against Arthur Rudolph “showing that Mr. Rudolph enforced the slave labor system at Mittelbau [Mittelwerk] and aided in the transmission of sabotage reports to the SS.” Arthur Rudolph had two choices, the Justice Department said. He could hire a lawyer and prepare to stand trial, or, alternatively, he could renounce his U.S. citizenship and leave the country at once. It was another seven months before the Justice Department made public that Arthur Rudolph had renounced his citizenship so as to avoid facing a war crimes trial. When asked to comment, Eli Rosenbaum said that Arthur Rudolph had contributed to “the death of thousands of slave laborers.” But Rosenbaum also said that it was Rudolph’s “almost unbelievable callousness and disregard [for] human life” that surprised him most. The story became front-page news around the world. Some individuals affiliated with NASA and other rocket-related government programs remained staunch supporters of Arthur Rudolph, calling the Justice Department’s actions against him a “witchhunt.” One of Rudolph’s leading proponents, Hugh McInnish, an engineer with the U.S. Army Strategic Defense Command, helped promote the idea that Rudolph, Dornberger, and von Braun had all confronted members of the SS during the war and had tried to get better working conditions for the slave laborers. “Their defenders’ assertions must be regarded with the greatest skepticism, especially as there is not a", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:Operation Paperclip_cleaned.txt:317:7075bf4c30f8", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 6230, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "Operation Paperclip_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/031622104X", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "Operation Paperclip_cleaned", "chunk_index": 318, "text": "programs remained staunch supporters of Arthur Rudolph, calling the Justice Department’s actions against him a “witchhunt.” One of Rudolph’s leading proponents, Hugh McInnish, an engineer with the U.S. Army Strategic Defense Command, helped promote the idea that Rudolph, Dornberger, and von Braun had all confronted members of the SS during the war and had tried to get better working conditions for the slave laborers. “Their defenders’ assertions must be regarded with the greatest skepticism, especially as there is not a single document to back them up,” says Michael J. Neufeld. “There is little doubt in my mind that Rudolph was deeply implicated.” The Rudolph exposé triggered keen interest in how it was that Arthur Rudolph came to America in the first place. This was a turning point in Operation Paperclip’s secret history. There is a broad misconception in America that there exists some kind of automatic declassification system that requires the government to reveal its secret programs after thirty or fifty years. In reality, the most damaging programs often remain classified for as long as they can be kept secret. The Freedom of Information Act, signed into law by President Lyndon Johnson, allows for the full or partial disclosure of some documents, but a request must be initiated by an individual or a group and is by no means a guarantee that information will be obtained. After the Arthur Rudolph story broke, journalist Linda Hunt began reporting on Operation Paperclip for CNN and the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists. She filed FOIA requests with the different military organizations and intelligence agencies involved and received varied responses. “I obtained six thousand Edgewood Arsenal documents in 1987 but it took more than a year, two attorneys and a threatened lawsuit to get the records [released],” says Hunt. When she arrived at the Washington National Records Center in the late 1980s to inspect the documents, she was told that Edgewood’s own historian had checked out seven of the boxes and that another twelve were missing. The army later agreed to look for the missing records and sent her a bill for $239, 680 in so-called search fees (the equivalent of $500, 000 in 2013). Eventually Linda Hunt was granted access to the documents, and in the early 1990s she published a book that unveiled many of Operation Paperclip’s seemingly impenetrable secrets. It was now no longer possible for the government to uphold the myth that Paperclip was a program peopled solely by benign German scientists, nominal Nazis, and moral men. As if pushing back against the Office of Special Investigations, just a few months after Arthur Rudolph was expelled from the United States, the Texas Senate passed a resolution declaring that June 15 was Dr. Hubertus Strughold Day.

Then Ohio State University’s medical college unveiled a portrait of Strughold on its mural of medical heroes. But the attempts by one organization to perpetrate a false myth can serve as a great motivator for another organization, and to this end the World Jewish Congress discovered and released information on Dr. Strughold that army intelligence had managed to keep classified for nearly fifty years. The New York Times verified that Dr. Strughold had been listed as among those being sought on the 1945 Central Registry of War Criminals and Security Suspects, or CROWCASS, list. Strughold’s portrait was removed from the Ohio State mural, where he appeared, ironically, alongside Hippocrates. Citizens who were offended by the Strughold library at the Brooks Air Force Base asked the air force when Strughold’s name was going to be removed from the U.S. government building. Library spokesman Larry Farlow told the Associated Press that there were no plans to remove the name from the Strughold Aeromedical Library. But growing pressure from the public forced the air force to reconsider its position. In 1995 General Ronald R. Fogleman, chief of staff of the Department of the Air Force, issued a terse statement stating that after reviewing Nazi-era documents, “the evidence of Dr. Strughold’s wartime activities is sufficient to cause concern about retaining his name in an honored place on the library.” The sign was removed from the building’s exterior brick walls, and the Strughold bronze portrait was taken down. The permanence of the honor had come to an end. Strughold died the following year, at the age of eighty-eight. The Justice Department had been preparing a Nazi war criminal case against Strughold in his final years. What does last? The desire to seek the truth? Or, in the words of Jean Michel, the ability to take a stand against “the monstrous distortion of history” when it gives birth to “false, foul and suspect myths”? In 1998, Congress passed the Nazi War Crimes Disclosure Act, which required various U.S. government agencies to identify and release federal records relating to Nazi war criminals that had been kept classified for decades. In accordance with the act, President Clinton established an Interagency Working Group—made up of federal agency representatives and members of the public— to oversee the interpretation of over eight million pages of U.S. government records and report its findings to Congress. The documentation revealed a vast web of profitable relationships between hundreds of Nazi war criminals and U.S. military and intelligence agencies.

In 2005, in a final report to Congress, U.S. Intelligence and the Nazis, the Interagency Working Group determined that “[t]he notion that they [the U.S. military and the CIA] employed only a few ‘bad apples’ will not stand up to the new documentation.” In hindsight, wrote the Interagency Working Group, the government’s use of Nazis was a very bad idea, and “ there was no compelling reason to begin the postwar era with the assistance of some of those associated with the worst crimes of the war.” And yet history now shows us that that is exactly what the American government did— and continued to do throughout the Cold War. A group of medical doctors and researchers in England, working on behalf of an organization called the Thalidomide Trust, believe they have tied the wartime work of IG Farben and Otto Ambros to the thalidomide tragedy of the late 1950s and early 1960s. After Ambros was released from Landsberg Prison, he worked as an economic consultant to German chancellor Konrad Adenauer and to the industrial magnate Friedrich Flick, the richest person in Germany during the Cold War. Like Ambros, Flick had been tried and convicted at Nuremberg, then released early by John J. McCloy. In the late 1950s, Ambros was also elected chairman of the advisory committee for a German company called Chemie Grünenthal. Grünenthal was about to market a new tranquilizer that promised pregnant women relief from morning sickness. The drug, called thalidomide, was going to be sold under the brand name Contergan. Otto Ambros served on the board of directors of Grünenthal. In the late 1950s, very few people knew that Grünenthal was a safe haven for many Nazis, including Dr. Ernst-Günther Schenck, the inspector of nutrition for the SS, and Dr. Heinz Baumkötter, an SS captain (Hauptsturmführer) and the chief concentration camp doctor in Mauthausen, Natzweiler-Struthof, and Sachsenhausen concentration camps. Ten months before Grünenthal’s public release of thalidomide, the wife of a Grünenthal employee, who took the drug to combat morning sickness, gave birth to a baby without ears. No one linked the birth defect to the drug, and thalidomide was released by the company. After several months on the market, in 1959, Grünenthal received its first reports that thalidomide caused polyneuropathy, or nerve damage, in the hands and feet of elderly people who took the drug. The drug’s over-the-counter status was changed so that it now required a prescription. Still, thalidomide was marketed aggressively in forty-six countries", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:Operation Paperclip_cleaned.txt:320:b19fd5fcb82d", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 6233, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "Operation Paperclip_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/031622104X", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "Operation Paperclip_cleaned", "chunk_index": 321, "text": "to combat morning sickness, gave birth to a baby without ears.

The drug’s over-the-counter status was changed so that it now required a prescription. Still, thalidomide was marketed aggressively in forty-six countries with a label that stated it could be “given with complete safety to pregnant women and nursing mothers without any adverse effect on mother and child.” Instead, the drug resulted in more than ten thousand mothers giving birth to babies with terrible deformities, creating the most horrific pharmaceutical disaster in the history of modern medicine. Many of the children were born without ears, arms, or legs and with reptilian, flipperlike appendages in place of healthy limbs. The origins of thalidomide were never accounted for. Grünenthal had always maintained that it lost its documents that showed where and when the first human trials were conducted on the drug. Then, in 2008, the Thalidomide Trust, in England, headed by Dr. Martin Johnson, located a group of Nazi-era documents that produced a link between thalidomide and the drugs researched and developed by IG Farben chemists during the war. Dr. Johnson points out that Grünenthal’s 1954 patents for thalidomide cryptically state that human trials had already been completed, but the company says it cannot offer that data because it was lost, ostensibly during the war. “The patents suggest that thalidomide was probably one of a number of products developed at Dyhernfurth or Auschwitz-Monowitz under the leadership of Otto Ambros in the course of nerve gas research,” Dr. Johnson says. The Thalidomide Trust also links Paperclip scientist Richard Kuhn to the medical tragedy. “Kuhn worked with a wide range of chemicals in his nerve gas research, and in his antidote research we know he used Antergan, which we are fairly sure was a ‘sister drug’ to Contergan,” the brand name for thalidomide, Dr. Johnson explains. Richard Kuhn Medal in his name. Nazi-era documents on Kuhn had been brought to the society’s attention, revealing that in “the spring of 1943 Kuhn asked the secretary-general of the KWS [Kaiser Wilhelm Society], Ernst Telschow, to support his search for the brains of ‘young and healthy men,’ presumably for nerve gas research.” The Society of German Chemists maintains that “the sources indicate that these brains were most likely taken from execution victims,” and that “[d]espite his scientific achievements, [Richard] Kuhn is not suitable to serve as a role model, and eponym for an important award, mainly due to his research on poison gas, but also due to his conduct towards Jewish colleagues.” It seems that the legacy of Hitler’s chemists has yet to be fully unveiled.

Because so many of these German scientists were seen as assets to the U.S. Army Chemical Corps’ nerve agent programs, and were thus wanted as participants in Operation Paperclip, secret deals were made, and the many documents pertaining to these arrangements were classified. President Clinton’s Interagency Working Group had access to eight million pages of declassified documents, but millions more documents remain classified. In U.S. Intelligence and the Nazis, the Interagency Working Group’s authors write that “the truest reckoning with the official past can never be complete without the full release of government records.” Part of the problem lies in identifying where records are physically located. For example, a 2012 FOIA request to the State Department, asking for the release of all files related to Otto Ambros, was denied on the grounds that no such files exist. But it is a matter of record, owing to a May 1971 news article in the Jewish Telegraphic Agency, that Otto Ambros traveled to the United States twice with the State Department’s assistance, despite his status as a convicted war criminal. In an interview with State Department official Fred Scott, the Jewish Telegraphic Agency learned, “Ambros came to the United States in 1967 after the State Department recommended to the Justice Department a waiver on his eligibility, which was granted,” and that in 1969, Ambros received a second visa waiver and traveled to the United States again. In the spring of 1971 Ambros was attempting to get a third visa waiver from the State Department when the Jewish Telegraphic Agency reported the story. According to Fred Scott, Ambros’s host for his May 1971 visit was listed as the Dow Chemical Company. After the story was published, Jewish groups held protests, and Ambros allegedly canceled his trip. But none of this information is contained in Ambros’s declassified U.S. Army files, FBI files, or CIA files. Otto Ambros was a convicted Nazi war criminal. In accordance with the Nazi War Crimes Disclosure Act, all files about him should have been released and declassified. But records that cannot be located cannot be declassified. Where are the Otto Ambros records hidden? And what secrets might be guarded therein? Names and dates continue to come to light, and researchers, journalists, and historians continue to uncover new facts. Fate and circumstance also inevitably play a part.

Names and dates continue to come to light, and researchers, journalists, and historians continue to uncover new facts. Fate and circumstance also inevitably play a part. In 2010 a cache of almost three hundred documents was found in the attic of a house being renovated in the Polish town of Oświȩcim, near Auschwitz. The documents include information about several Nazi doctors and Farben chemists who worked at the death camp. “The sensational value of this discovery is the fact that these original documents, bearing the names of the main murderers from Auschwitz, were found so many years after the war,” says Adam Cyra, a historian at the Auschwitz museum. Otto Ambros lived until 1990, to the age of ninety-two. After his death, the chemical conglomerate BASF, on whose board of directors he had served, lauded him as “an expressive entrepreneurial figure of great charisma.” Is the old German proverb really true? Jedem das Seine. Does everyone get what he deserves? Still, as of 2013, the Space Medicine Association in America continues to bestow its prestigious Hubertus Strughold Award to a scientist or specialist for outstanding contribution to aviation medicine. It has done so every year since 1963. On December 1, 2012, the Wall Street Journal ran a page-one story about Dr. Strughold, presenting revelatory new information about his criminal activities during the war. German historian Prof. Hans-Walter Schmuhl had been researching another subject when he came across evidence that showed that Dr. Strughold had allowed epileptic children to be experimented on inside the high-altitude chamber at Strughold’s Aviation Medical Research Institute of the Reich Air Ministry in Berlin. Rabbits had been put to the test first and had died. Next, Reich medical researchers wanted to see what would happen to young children with epilepsy subjected to those same conditions. Strughold authorized the potentially lethal tests on the children. “The head of the Institute is responsible,” says Schmuhl; “using this expensive equipment, the head of an institute had to have been informed about the use.” When the German Society for Air and Space Medicine learned about Schmuhl’s discovery, they eliminated their prestigious Strughold Award, which had been given annually in Germany since the mid-1970s. In America, the Wall Street Journal article renewed debate as to why the Space Medicine Association had not yet eliminated its Hubertus Strughold Award. Dr. Mark Campbell, a former president of the Space Medicine Association, insists the award will not go away. Campbell blames the Internet for maligning what he sees as Dr. Strughold’s good character. “I was a member of a committee investigating Dr. Strughold to see if his name should be removed from the Space Medicine Association", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:Operation Paperclip_cleaned.txt:323:aa9bf07d25a5", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 6236, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "Operation Paperclip_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/031622104X", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "Operation Paperclip_cleaned", "chunk_index": 324, "text": "mid-1970s.

Campbell blames the Internet for maligning what he sees as Dr. Strughold’s good character. “I was a member of a committee investigating Dr. Strughold to see if his name should be removed from the Space Medicine Association Strughold Award,” says Campbell. “I was amazed to find that the facts that were uncovered were so different from the claims being made on the Internet.” But most of Dr. Campbell’s colleagues disagree. “Why defend him?” asks Dr. Stephen Véronneau, a research medical officer at the FAA’s Civil Aerospace Medical Institute in Oklahoma City, and a member of the Space Medicine Association. “I can’t find another example in the world of [an institution] honoring Dr. Strughold except my own association.” The National Space Club Florida Committee, one of three committees of the National Space Club in Washington, D.C., gives out a similarly prestigious space-related award called the Dr. Kurt H. Debus Award. This annual award is named in honor of Operation Paperclip’s Kurt Debus, who became the first director of the Kennedy Space Center. Kurt Debus is the scientist who, during the war, was an enthusiastic member of the SS, wore the SS uniform to work, and turned a colleague over to the Gestapo for making anti-Nazi remarks and failing to give Debus the Nazi salute. Under Operation Paperclip, Kurt Debus worked on missiles for the army and for NASA for a total of twenty-eight years—many of which he spent alongside Arthur Rudolph and Wernher von Braun. Kurt Debus retired in 1974. In 2013, after the Strughold award debate resurfaced, I interviewed Steve Griffin, the National Space Club chairman, to determine why the organization continues to give out an award that is named after someone who was once an avowed and active Nazi. OMGUS security report had been declassified and the revelation that he was an active member of Heinrich Himmler’s SS had been revealed. “It is not my purview to decide if we have an award or what it is called,” Griffin says. But Griffin conceded that he has been on the board of the National Space Club since the Debus award’s inception, so technically it is, and always has been, within his purview. Like so many of those involved in Operation Paperclip decades ago, Griffin looks past Debus’s former commitment to Nazi Party ideology. He only sees the scientist. To report this book, I filed dozens of Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests, some of which were honored, many of which were denied, and most of which are still pending.

I came across oblique references, circa 1945, regarding a supposed list of Nazi doctors whom the Office of U.S. Chief of Counsel, U.S. Army, sought for involvement in “mercy killings,” or medical murder crimes. FOIA requests for the list turned up nothing. Then, at the Harvard Medical Library, I found a collection of papers that once belonged to Colonel Robert J. Benford, the first commander of Operation Paperclip’s aviation medicine research program at the Army Air Forces Aero Medical Center in Heidelberg. Benford, with Dr. Strughold, oversaw the work of the fifty-eight Nazi doctors at the center; both Benford and Strughold worked under Colonel Harry Armstrong. In Benford’s papers I came across a file labeled “List of Personnel Involved in Medical Research and Mercy Killings,” but the access to the file was “Restricted Until 2015.” The Harvard Medical Library informed me that the Department of Defense had classified the list and that only the DoD had the authority to declassify it. Harvard filed a FOIA request on my behalf, and the “mercy killings” list was declassified and released to me. Included on this list, which had been in Colonel Benford’s possession, were seven Nazi doctors hired under Operation Paperclip: Theodor Benzinger, Kurt Blome, Konrad Schäfer, Walter Schreiber, Hermann Becker-Freyseng, Siegfried Ruff, and Oskar Schröder. The fact became instantly clear: U.S. Army intelligence knew all along that these doctors were implicated in murder yet chose to classify the list and hire the doctors for Operation Paperclip. Blome, Schäfer, Becker-Freyseng, Ruff, and Schröder were all tried at Nuremberg. Schreiber’s public outing in 1951 and his subsequent banishment from America are now on record. Dr. Theodor Benzinger seems to have slipped away from accountability. From his New York Times obituary in 1999, the world learned that Dr. Theodor Benzinger, 94, invented the ear thermometer, a nominal contribution to the medical world. As for the military world, Benzinger’s research work for the navy was destroyed or remains classified as of 2013. Wernher von Braun, Arthur Rudolph, Kurt Debus, and Hubertus Strughold led the American effort to get man to the moon. The question remains, despite a man’s contribution to a nation or a people, how do we interpret a fundamental wrong? Is the American government at fault equally for fostering myths about its Paperclip scientists—for encouraging them to whitewash their past so that their scientific acumen could be exploited for U.S. weapons-related work? When, for a nation, should the end justify the means? These are questions that can only be answered separately,", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:Operation Paperclip_cleaned.txt:325:95eb341403a5", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 6238, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "Operation Paperclip_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/031622104X", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "Operation Paperclip_cleaned", "chunk_index": 326, "text": "the American effort to get man to the moon.

When, for a nation, should the end justify the means? These are questions that can only be answered separately, by individuals. But as facts emerge and history is clarified, the answers become more suitably informed. In addition to the ear thermometer, Theodor Benzinger left the world with the Planck-Benzinger equation, fine-tuning the second law of thermodynamics, which states that nothing lasts. Benzinger’s lifelong scientific pursuit was studying entropy—the idea that chaos rules the world and, like ice melting in a warm room, order leads to disorder. I prefer Gerhard Maschkowski’s take on what matters and what lasts. Maschkowski was the Jewish teenager fortuitously spared the gas chamber at Auschwitz because he was of use to IG Farben as a slave laborer at their Buna factory. I was interviewing Maschkowski one spring afternoon in 2012 when I asked him the question, “What matters, what lasts?” He chuckled and smiled. He pushed back the sleeve on his shirt and showed me his blue-ink Auschwitz tattoo. “This lasts,” he said. “But it is also a record of [the] truth.” Major General Dr. Walter Schreiber was the surgeon general of the Third Reich. “The most sinister crime in which Schreiber is involved is the introduction of intravenous lethal phenol injections,” explained war crimes investigator Dr. Leopold Alexander, “as a quick and convenient means of executing troublemakers.” Paperclip contracts: U.S. Army, Camp King, Germany; U.S. Air Force, Texas.

Not knowing much about Operation Paperclip back then, I was very surprised when I learned that just a few years after the war’s end, Siegfried Knemeyer was living in America working for the U.S. Air Force, and that he would eventually be awarded the U.S. Department of Defense Distinguished Civilian Service Award—the highest civilian award given by the DoD. In 2010, I located Siegfried Knemeyer’s grandson, Dirk Knemeyer, and asked if he would meet with me for an interview. He agreed. Dirk Knemeyer is an American father, husband, entrepreneur, and businessman. By his own admission, he spends a good deal of his time thinking philosophically about concepts of “identity,” “science,” “time,” and “life.” When I first met him, Dirk Knemeyer shared with me that he had never before spoken publicly about his grandfather’s wartime activities, and that most members of his family go out of their way to maintain silence about Siegfried Knemeyer’s high ranking in the Nazi Party. “For the most part the family’s position is: Do not discuss Siegfried’s [past] with anyone, particularly not a journalist,” Dirk Knemeyer says. “But what do you do when you have documents in your attic, as I do, praising your grandfather and his excellent work, and signed by people like Hermann Göring and Albert Speer?” I wish to thank Dr. Götz Blome, Gabriella Hoffmann, Paul-Hermann Schieber, and Rolf Benzinger for their time and their transparency. The indomitable John Dolibois, whom I admire: Thank you for taking the time with me on so many different points. Dr. Jens Westemeier assisted me with all things German in this book and located some very difficult to find documents in numerous German archives; thank you, Jens.

Jedem das Seine: Derives from the Latin phrase Suum cuique, “to each his own” or “to each what he deserves.” The phrase is also attributed to Cicero, who wrote, “Iustitia suum cuique distribuit.” In Nazi Germany these slogans were transformed into propaganda phrases and were hung over the main entrance gate to many concentration camps. Jedem das Seine was over Buchenwald. Arbeit macht frei, “Work makes you free,” was over Auschwitz. thirty subcamps: As explained at the memorial site, “Dora and other subcamps originally belonging to the Buchenwald complex were amalgamated to form the independent Mittelbau-Dora Concentration Camp, in which Dora now served as the main camp.

However, according to the Times, this was immediately disputed by the top two members of the House Intelligence Committee. A spokesman for Representative Peter Hoekstra (R-MI), who at the time chaired the oversight committee, said that he was “never briefed or advised” that the tapes even existed, let alone “that they were going to be destroyed.”7 Kean and Hamilton had a similar gut reaction: outrage. In their January 2008 article in the New York Times they state categorically that the CIA never informed them about any taped interrogations, despite their repeated requests for all pertinent information about the captured al Qaeda operatives, who were then in CIA custody. In fact, as damaging as the news about the destruction of evidence surely was, the story laid bare an even more serious problem. One might naturally assume that the offi cial commission charged to investigate the events of 9/11 would have had unfettered access to all of the evidence pertinent to the case, including government documents, and especially key witnesses. This goes without saying. Access was vital to the success of the investigation. How else could the commission do its work? Yet, it never happened. In the same article Kean and Hamilton summarize their dealings with the CIA.8 They describe their private meetings with CIA Director George Tenet and how he denied them access to the captured members of al Qaeda. Notice, this means that the panel never conducted its own interviews. Tenet even denied the co-chairs permission to conduct secondhand interviews with the CIA interrogators, which Kean and Hamilton felt were needed “to better judge the credibility of the witnesses and clarify ambigui ties in the reporting.” 9Ultimately, the commission was forced to rely on third-hand intelligence reports prepared by the CIA itself. Many of these reports were poorly written and incomplete summaries10 that, according to the co-chairs “raised almost as many questions as they answered.”11 In order to resolve the many uncertainties, the commission prepared a list of questions, which it then submitted to the CIA. The questions covered a range of topics, such as the translations from the Arabic, inconsistencies in the detainees’ stories, the context of the questioning, how the interrogators followed up certain lines of questioning, and the assessments of the interrogators themselves. But the CIA’s response was less than helpful. According to Kean and Hamilton, “the [CIA] general counsel responded in writing with non-specifi c replies.” This is a bland way of saying that the agency rebuffed the panel. Not satisfi ed, Kean and Hamilton made yet another attempt to gain access to the captives, but were again denied permission during a face-to-face meeting with Tenet in December 2003. For this reason the ambiguities and other questions went unresolved,", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:The 9_11 Mystery Plane - Mark H.

For this reason the ambiguities and other questions went unresolved, fl awing the commission’s fi nal report. Yet, as I have indicated, the more serious problem was the panel’s lack of access to begin with, a problem which was by no means obvious until this story broke in the mainstream press. In fact, Kean and Hamilton had inserted a caveat in their report (on page 146) conceding this crucial point: that they were denied access to the witnesses. Most readers probably passed over it without understanding its awful signifi cance. I know I did on my fi rst reading. There was another revelation — no less disturbing. Not even Porter J. Goss, CIA Director at the the time, knew about the destruction of the audio-tapes, which, as noted, had been ordered by Jose A. Rodriguez, the CIA’s Director of Operations (as in covert operations). According to the Times, Goss was angered to learn that he had been kept out of the loop. 12However, he declined to make a public statement. What are we to make of this? Why was the CIA chief kept in the dark about the destruction of evidence deemed vital to the 9/11 investigation? This is no less shocking than the destruction of the tapes, because it points to a disconnect in the chain of command. At very least, it means that Goss was not fully briefed about the CIA’s handling of the 9/11 interrogations when he was appointed to the Directorship. But why wouldn’t he be? Was the CIA’s covert branch, long notorious for staging rogue operations, up to its old tricks? Are there loose cannons at Langley, still? Of one thing there can be no doubt: The 9/11 Commission Report was packaged and sold to the American people like some trendy product. The mass media have told us countless times that it is the defi nitive version of the events of September 11. No wonder that in 2008 most Americans probably take this for granted. When something is repeated enough times by the “authorities,” people absorb it. The public ends up believing whatever it is told, whether true or not. We witnessed a similar case during the run-up to the 2003 U.S. invasion of Iraq, when the Bush administration mantra about Saddam Hussain’s Weapons of Mass Destruction and his supposed links to al Qaeda were drummed into the brain of every American through mass marketing.

Today, of course, we know different. None of it was true. Yet, on the eve of that war a Washington Post poll found that 70% of Americans believed that Saddam had WMDs and was responsible for 9/11. The case is a sobering reminder of the power of the corporate media to shape public opinion with — let us call it by its true name — propaganda. OK. The better part of a decade has passed. Are we Americans prepared to face reality? The 9/11 Commission’s lack of direct access to the captured members of al Qaeda can only mean that the offi cial 9/11 investigation was fundamentally compromised from the outset. Given the disclosures I have cited, no other conclusion is possible. In their January 2008 article in the Times, Kean and Hamilton do not repudiate their own report, at least not in so many words. But they come close. They insinuate that the CIA’s stonewalling calls into question the veracity of key parts of the offi cial story, namely, the plot against America supposedly masterminded by Khalid Shiekh Mohammed and approved by Osama bin Laden. Until now, the nation has assumed that all of this was soundly based on the testimony of the captured al Qaeda operatives, several of whom supposedly confessed. This is the story as told in the 9/11 Commission Report. But probe more deeply and one fi nds the devil lurking in the details. The reality is that, without independent confi rmation about what the captives actually confessed to, precisely what was said and by whom, indeed whether they confessed at all, there is absolutely no way for us to know how much of the offi cial story is true and how much was fabricated by the CIA for reasons we can only guess. There is another problem. If the confessions were extracted by means of torture, then just how reliable can they be? It comes down to whether the CIA is telling the truth. Should we believe them? If the captives did confess as reported, why did the CIA refuse the 9/11 Commission access to the witnesses? Obviously, something is not right. In fact, for all we know, the entire story is a pack of lies. And there is another important question: How did the miscarriage of a lawful process of discovery happen, given that Congress invested the 9/11 Commission with the authority to subpoena evidence?

And there is another important question: How did the miscarriage of a lawful process of discovery happen, given that Congress invested the 9/11 Commission with the authority to subpoena evidence? Fortunately, in February 2008, along came The Commission, a “tell-all” book by Philip Shenon with much to say about the above, and some answers.The book’s sub-title, The Uncensored History of the 9/11 Investigation, sounds promising, and the author does not fail to deliver. Shenon covered the 9/11 Commission for the New York Times, and over the course of the investigation he personally interviewed many of the commissioners and staff. His best-selling book is a well written exposé and our best look yet at what went on behind-the-scenes. Shenon obviously enjoys playing the role of reporter. Although he makes his opinions known in the book, the author fortunately does not overburden us with his own conclusions. Most of the time Shenon describes what happened through the eyes of the commissioners and staff. For this reason his book offers valuable insights about why the investigation failed. Of course, we already knew large parts of the story. We knew, for example, about National Security Adviser Condoleezza Rice’s incompetence, and about the serious confl icts of interest on the commission, particularly in the person of Philip Zelikow, who served as the panel’s executive director. In that capacity Zelikow controlled many facets of the investigation, including the scheduling of witnesses and the vital fl ow of information between the staff and commissioners. Zelikow also edited (and, no doubt, doctored) the fi nal report. In addition to being a long-time confi dante of Rice, with whom he coauthored a book, Zelikow served on G.W. Bush’s transition team and even drafted a national security strategy paper the Bush administration later used to justify the 2003 war against Iraq. It is hard to believe that Kean and Hamilton, who claim that their goal was to lead a nonpartisan investigation, would have knowingly hired such a man — a neocon — to manage the panel’s day-to-day affairs. According to Shenon, it only happened because Zelikow failed to report the full extent of his ties to the Bush administration when he submitted his resume for the job. If Zelikow had been more forthcoming, he would have been instantly eliminated from consideration. But this hardly excuses Kean and Hamilton for failing to thoroughly vet the candidate. They would have been wise to listen to the families of the victims, who demanded Zelikow’s resignation. The families believed that more than enough was known about the man, and hindsight proves them correct. Shenon’s most important revelation has sped the unraveling process.

The families believed that more than enough was known about the man, and hindsight proves them correct. Shenon’s most important revelation has sped the unraveling process. The author names CIA Director George Tenet as one of the government offi cials who the commissioners and staff were convinced had lied during the hearings.13 Tenet gave testimony on three occasions (in addition to the private meetings with Kean and Hamilton), and in each of these hearings the CIA Director suffered from a faulty memory, frequently responding with “I can’t remember.” Initially, the commissioners were inclined to be sympathetic, and gave the director the benefi t of the doubt. (At the time, Tenet’s supporters at the agency reportedly made excuses for their boss: George cannot remember because he is dead-tired, physically exhausted from dealing with the war on terrorism. Or: he has been suffering from sleep deprivation — not getting enough shuteye.14 Poor old George.) But gradually the tide turned. By Tenet’s third appearance it was obvious to everyone he was perjuring himself. Again, some of his perjury had been known. For instance, it was known that Tenet lied to the 9/11 Commission in April 2004 when he denied his meetings with President Bush in the weeks before the September 11 attack. “I didn’t see the president,” Tenet told commissioner Tim Roemer. “I was not in briefi ngs with him during this time. He [i.e., Bush] was on vacation; I was here [i.e., in Washington].” 15Tenet added that he did not even speak with Bush on the telephone during this period. But Tenet’s denial was immediately exposed as a lie, because the president had already gone on record about the meetings. On August 25, 2001 during a walking tour of his Crawford ranch, Bush casually “let slip” to the press that he had met with Tenet the previous day about “a very important subject.”16 The CIA was forced to issue a retraction the day after the hearing: Tenet “misspoke.”17 Yet, from Bush’s 2001 remarks, it is abundantly clear (with the benefi t of hindsight) that the August 24, 2001 meeting at the ranch was less a briefi ng than a war council. The pow-wow took place on Bush’s front porch and by his own estimate lasted about six hours — most of the day. Also in attendance: National Security Adviser Condoleezza Rice, Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld, and Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs Richard Myers.

This was a little more than two weeks before the attack. Yet, we are supposed to believe that Bush was on vacation, down on the ranch. Is it reasonable to think that Tenet simply forgot about the meeting? No, of course not. It appears that he lied in an attempt to keep it secret. Tenet’s performance before the commission must have been a spectacle to behold, but one would never know this from reading the 9/11 Commission Report, which gives no hint that the Director of Central Intelligence lied to the panel. Why not? Thomas Kean gave the reason at the commission’s fi rst public hearing in New York City, when he said, “Our … purpose will not be to point fi ngers.” I should add that his comment was not well received. According to Shenon, it prompted a rumble in the audience, and even elicited sneers from the families of the victims who wanted the responsible offi cials to be held accountable. 17But not even this reluctance to assign blame adequately explains why the panel took the CIA at its word regarding the interrogations of the al Qaeda captives, since by this time it was common knowledge that Tenet was lying through his teeth. We are left to ponder why Kean and Hamilton failed to insist on some type of independent confi rmation. Of course, when Tenet stiffed the commission, he was merely carrying on a time-honored Langley tradition. For the fi rst 25 years of its existence, the CIA functioned entirely outside the U.S. constitutional framework of government. Like it or not, this is the reality. This state of affairs prevailed until the Watergate era, when the Church hearings in the Senate exposed a laundry list of criminal activities by the CIA, such as domestic spying, the assassination of foreign leaders, the overthrow of governments, not to mention the nasty habit of deceiving Congress. Those dark revelations shocked the nation and led to the creation of House and Senate intelligence committees, to provide the democratic oversight that was sorely lacking. Anyway, such was the intent. But, as with so many good ideas, things did not turn out as expected. The CIA soon found ways around the oversight process, which is not surprising when you consider that clandestine operations are what the CIA is all about.

Today, the Intelligence Committees in both houses are widely viewed as a joke, and despite a chorus of denials from the agency and its admirers, the perception is undoubtedly correct. To his credit, Shenon touches on the issue in his book. The author mentions that one of the commissioners, former Senator Slade Gorton (R-WA), once served on the Senate Intelligence Committee but quit in frustration because of the lack of any serious business. Said Gorton, “I felt it was a useless exercise — I never felt I was being told anything that I hadn’t learned in the Washington Post.” 18 As to why Kean and Hamilton did not make more aggressive use of their authority to subpoena evidence, Shenon’s answer is not very satisfying, but it rings true. The co-chairs were overcautious because they wished to avoid a legal showdown that would drag out in the courts.19 A legal stalemate threatened to delay their investigation beyond the mandated deadline. This, in their view, would have been tantamount to a Bush victory. But it was a huge mistake — their worst. Had Kean and Hamilton stood tough and issued blanket subpoenas early in the investigation, as their legal counsel advised, the inevitable showdown in the courts might have worked in their favor. Bush and Tenet would have been perceived — correctly — as obstructing the investigation and would have come under increasing pressure and scrutiny. That sort of confrontation would have served the discovery process and the cause of 9/11 truth. Unfortunately, it didn’t happen. This helps to explain why the offi cial investigation failed in its stated objective: “to provide the fullest possible account of the events surrounding 9/11.”20 Although Philip Shenon supports the offi cial narrative, his research was so narrowly focused that his rather casual discounting of “conspiracy theorists” can do no harm to the 9/11 truth movement. (Here, of course, “conspiracy theorist” means anyone who does not agree with the offi cial conspiracy theory.) I gave Shenon’s book only three stars in my review at Amazon.com, because the author seems genuinely unaware that by 2007 the evidence had shifted decisively in favor of the “conspiracy theorists.” There is simply no excuse for Shenon not knowing the facts. In the following pages I will present much of this evidence. A showdown over 9/11, though long delayed, appears to be developing, and portends — I believe — a coming shift in the terms of the debate: away from the previous discussion about the incompetence of offi cials and “security failures” to more grave issues.

But how this important drama will play out remains unclear. Obviously, a new legally-empowered investigative body is urgently needed. Will it happen? Perhaps, but only if the American people demand it. Seven years after the terrible events of 9/11, numerous anomalies associated with the collapse of the World Trade Center and the Pentagon crash have yet to be explained, and remain controversial. To this day, there is also considerable uncertainty about the actual chronology of events, i.e., exactly what happened and when. A glance at Paul Thompson’s invaluable book, The Terror Timeline, shows that the offi cial narrative as presented in the 9/11 Commission Report is at best a partial record and at worst a fabrication, since what it leaves out often confl icts with the offi cial story it presents.1 Fortunately, an updated version of Thompson’s timeline is readily accessible on the Internet.2 Professor David Ray Griffi n’s books about 9/11 are also an invaluable resource, particularly his most recent, 9/11 Contradictions (2008) and Debunking 9/11 Debunking (2007). Griffi n is a careful scholar and has exposed numerous fl aws in the offi cial investigation, including cases of deception. His books should be regarded as companion volumes to the 9/11 Commission Report, and, together with Thompson’s website, are indispensable to anyone trying to understand what happened on that historic day. One thing is certain: The same powerful interests that conspired to subvert the 9/11 Commission will use all of their infl uence to defeat a new investigation, fi rst by attempting to block its creation, and, failing that, by controlling it. Americans who are committed to 9/11 truth must not allow this to happen. We must steel ourselves to whatever level of struggle is required to expose the truth. To say that the stakes are high would be an understatement. The future of our nation — whether the republic will survive — may hinge on the outcome. Without question, we have entered the most dangerous time in U.S. history. If there is good news it is the irreversible nature of the unraveling process. Once begun, it moves in only one direction.

The offi cial 9/11 narrative did not emerge in its present fi nal form all of a piece. The offi cial story is the product of evolution and underwent two major revisions. The military announced the fi rst revision a week after the attack. The 9/11 Commission unveiled the second in its fi nal report, released in July 2004. Dr. David Ray Griffi n has argued persuasively that both revisions were attempts to salvage the offi cial conspiracy theory. 1 2 Before we proceed, it might be helpful to review how this process unfolded. We start, of course, with the events themselves and the raw news coverage on the day of the attack, especially the riveting television reports, which exposed NORAD’s failure to intercept any of the four allegedly hi- jacked planes. At fi rst, of course, the nation was understandably in a state of shock, but within days the full magnitude of the U.S. military’s failed response began to sink in. On September 13, 2001, General Richard Myers, acting Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, admitted to the Senate Armed Services Committee that the fi rst Air National Guard fi ghters had not arrived to defend Washington until well after the Pentagon strike, roughly 90 minutes after the fi rst sign of trouble aboard American Airlines Flight 11.3 During all of that time the nation’s capital had been exposed — undefended. Myers’ testimony caused huge problems for the military because NORAD’s failure went beyond negligence and looked like a deliberate standdown, which, if true, was treason. Days later, on September 18, 2001, the Pentagon attempted to shield itself from mounting criticism by announcing the fi rst revised timeline, essentially placing the blame for the massive breach of security on the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA).4 The Joint Chiefs claimed that the military was unable to respond in a timely manner because the FAA failed to notify NORAD about the hijacked planes until too late. As 9/11 commissioner Bob Kerrey later pointed out, this fi rst major alteration in the story occurred immediately after Pentagon generals (probably including Myers) briefed President Bush on September 17, 2001.5 His point was that the White House obviously had instructed the Joint Chiefs to change their tune. This fi rst revised timeline stood for almost three years, but suffered from", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:The 9_11 Mystery Plane - Mark H.

This fi rst revised timeline stood for almost three years, but suffered from the serious problem of being improbable. Why? In the fi rst place, because there is nothing unusual about the FAA’s scrambling of NORAD fi ghters. The procedure is routine. If a commercial or private aircraft deviates from its scheduled fl ight-path by as little as two miles, or if there is a loss of radio contact, or if its transponder stops transmitting, FAA air traffi c controllers will fi rst attempt to contact the pilot and remedy the problem. Failing this, the standard FAA protocol is to request immediate assistance from NORAD. Furthermore, if there is any doubt, FAA policy is to assume the worst and declare an air emergency, which means an automatic scramble. 6During one nine-month period in the year 2000 the FAA made sixty-seven such requests, and in every case NORAD responded by scrambling fi ghters — all without a hitch.7 This is an average of about two scrambles a week, more than 100 per year. Yet, we are supposed to believe that on 9/11, for no apparent reason, FAA controllers began to behave like a bunch of morons. Their alleged failure to contact NORAD on 9/11 was doubly strange, even bizarre, since the FAA simultaneously showed remarkable professionalism and skill by grounding approximately 4500 commercial and private aircraft in less than three hours, all without a single mishap. The shutdown started in New York after the second WTC impact (at 9:03 A.M.), and quickly spread. By 9:26 A.M. the ground-stop was nationwide. The FAA shutdown of the entire air traffi c system was unprecedented in the annals of U.S. aviation and was all the more impressive given the adverse, i.e., essentially wartime, conditions that prevailed. At least two FAA facilities had to be evacuated that morning in response to perceived threats of terrorism.8 The commission even admits in its fi nal report that the FAA performed “fl awlessly.”9 Yet, we are supposed to believe that on the same morning this same agency fumbled a routine phone hand-off to NORAD four times in succession. This simply does not add up. As time passed it also became apparent that the Pentagon’s revised timeline suffered from an even more serious problem. Assuming the revised story was correct, arguably there was still suffi cient time for NORAD to scramble fi ghters and intercept at least two of the “hijacked” planes, namely, Flight 77 (which allegedly hit the Pentagon) and Flight", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:The 9_11 Mystery Plane - Mark H.

The 9/11 Commission acknowledges these diffi culties in its fi nal report released in July 2004, then attempts to resolve them by introducing a second major revision of the story, which puts the blame even more emphatically on the FAA. According to this most recent offi cial timeline, the FAA was not merely tardy in making the hand-offs, it failed altogether. In the case of Flight 77 offi cials supposedly had less than two minutes of warning about its fi nal approach. The report further asserts that NORAD did not receive notifi cation that Flights 175, 93 and 77 had been hijacked until after the planes had crashed. The new timeline effectively absolves the Joint Chiefs of Staff of any negligence. The latest revision was supposedly based on new evidence that exposed serious discrepancies in the Pentagon’s previous testimony before the panel in May 2003. During those early hearings USAF Col. Alan Scott told the commission that F-16 fi ghters had been scrambled from Langley AFB near Hampton, Virginia, at 9:24 A.M. (and were airborne by 9:30 A.M.) for the purpose of intercepting Flight 77. NORAD Maj. Gen. Larry Arnold also testifi ed at this same hearing. He confi rmed this scramble time, but stated that the Langley fi ghters had been sent to protect Washington from hijacked Flight 93.11 The new evidence was in the form of NORAD audio-tapes from 9/11, which the government had withheld for many months, but which thanks to a court order were fi nally handed over to the 9/11 Commission late in the investigation. When the panel reviewed these NORAD tapes in June 2004, they discovered a previously unknown transmission, which became the basis for a completely new element in the story: the so called “phantom plane scenario,” fi rst unveiled in the 9/11 Commission Report. The transmission supposedly proves that in the one instance where the FAA did alert NORAD, i.e., in the case of hijacked Flight 11, the FAA got it wrong and passed incorrect information, sending NORAD on a wild goose chase after a nonexistent aircraft. According to the report, someone at the FAA mistakenly notifi ed NORAD at 9:24 A.M. that Flight 11 was still in the air, that is, had not crashed into the North Tower, and was headIng south toward Washington.", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:The 9_11 Mystery Plane - Mark H.

Here, the plot thickens, however, because at this point a bizarre screw-up occurred, one that has never been explained. Instead of handing-off the Langley fi ghters to air traffi c controllers in the Washington DC area, local controllers sent the fi ghters to a military training airspace over the Atlantic known as “Whiskey 386.” This explains why the fi ghters failed to arrive in time to defend against incoming Flight 77, which in the meantime had mysteriously appeared on the radar screens southwest of the capital.13 This new disclosure was a major change in the offi cial story and was embarrassing to the Pentagon, because it contradicted earlier testimony of Col. Alan Scott and Generals Richard Myers, Ralph Eberhart and Larry Arnold, none of whom had previously mentioned the phantom plane. Indeed, when Arnold was recalled for his second appearance before the commission in June 2004 he still did not have his facts straight, nearly three years after the event. Arnold had to be coached by panel members. His inability to recall details that as a NORAD commander he should have known caused shock and outrage on the panel. According to the Washington Post, the commission and staffers were convinced that the Pentagon had deliberately deceived them: “[S]uspicion of wrongdoing ran so deep that the ten-member commission, in a secret meeting at the end of its tenure in summer 2004, debated referring the matter to the Justice Department for criminal investigation.” John Farmer, one of the commissioners, said, “I was shocked at how different the truth was from the way it was described.”15 But the outrage never made it into the 9/11 Commission Report, which mentions nothing about deception. The report merely states that the generals’ previous testimony was “incorrect.” 16Although much has been made of this loss of face by the Pentagon, “what is really going on,” as David Ray Griffi n has pointed out, “is that the military is briefl y suffering a little embarrassment, experienced primarily by a few scapegoats [eg., General Arnold], for the sake of the new story, which, if accepted, permanently removes the suspicion of guilt for treason and murder from everyone in the military.” 17Griffi n has it right.

A close reading of the 9/11 Commission Report shows that its main objective is to exonerate the Pentagon brass of responsibility for the breach of security on September 11. This is why the latest Kean/Hmilton about-face discussed in my introduction is so important. The sharp tone of Kean and Hamilton’s January 2008 op-ed in the New York Times blasting the CIA for obstruction is a radical departure from the bland non-confrontational style of their fi nal report, which pointed no fi ngers (except in the direction of the FAA) and indeed bent over backward to exonerate the Pentagon and CIA from any culpability. The shift in tone is a red fl ag, and this should alert us. We must not be fooled by the bland language of the 9/11 Commission Report, which deserves to be recognized for what it is: a thoroughly sanitized account. Crucially, the commission failed to subject the NORAD tapes to forensic analysis, which ought to have been a priority, given the disparities in the previous testimony as evidenced by the tapes. The 9/11 Commission Report fails to provide even one checkable source to substantiate the NORAD tapes as evidence. It is the same problem we encountered in the case of the CIA interrogations. In the absence of independent confi rmation, we have no assurance about the NORAD tapes’ authenticity, hence, can have no confi dence in the “corrected” story. Perhaps the phantom plane played no part in the earlier timeline because, as Griffi n suggests, its part in the story is simply a fabrication. That would certainly explain why the generals failed to mention it in their previous testimony, and why General Arnold was unfamiliar with it as late as June 2004. At issue here is whether the Pentagon and the commission are telling the truth. The added problem, as Griffi n has ably shown, is that even if we wish to believe the latest version of the offi cial narrative, this means we must also accept that the Joint Chiefs deliberately deceived the panel and the nation about the previous timeline for nearly three years. Moreover, because the entire chain of command remained silent, it too was complicit in the deception. While it is usually assumed that if the generals lied it was to conceal their own incompetence, why would they expose themselves to the treasonous charge of implementing a stand-down by understating the FAA’s degree of negligence on 9/11, as they did in their fi rst revised narrative, if the FAA was in fact even more culpable, as the latest revision holds?18 This makes no sense and should", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:The 9_11 Mystery Plane - Mark H.

While it is usually assumed that if the generals lied it was to conceal their own incompetence, why would they expose themselves to the treasonous charge of implementing a stand-down by understating the FAA’s degree of negligence on 9/11, as they did in their fi rst revised narrative, if the FAA was in fact even more culpable, as the latest revision holds?18 This makes no sense and should increase our skepticism about every facet of the offi cial story. Indeed, we are compelled to consider the admittedly sinister alternative explanation that the generals lied to conceal their complicity in the 9/11 attack, perhaps even their role in staging it. This would explain both their previous “incorrect” testimony and their unreserved acceptance of the new timeline. One of the NORAD generals was actually heard to remark, “The real story [i.e., the latest version] is better than the one we told.”19 Given that the latest version had the effect of exonerating the generals, one can appreciate his point of view. But was it “better” for the nation? There is another serious problem: Assuming the FAA was guilty of gross negligence on 9/11, why was no one ever held accountable? Not a single FAA offi cial was ever prosecuted, dismissed, demoted, or even reprimanded. Why not? Did the Bush administration refrain from disciplining the FAA because this would have begun a legal process of discovery/ appeal involving the scrutiny of relevant documents by the courts and the release of real evidence, a process which had to be avoided at all costs? As we know, instead of handing out dismissals and demotions, the Bush administration rewarded a number of offi cials and offi cers who held responsible positions on 9/11. CIA Director George Tenet, a prime example, was awarded the Medal of Freedom, the nation’s highest honor, despite presiding over the “worst security failure” in U.S. history. The Bush policy of rewarding failure was perverse and violated the most basic principle of good government, which is that people should be held accountable for their actions. This strongly suggests that the Bush White House purchased the cooperation and silence of numerous offi cials by handing out bribes. Spectacular compensatory awards were also offered to families of the victims. The cash payments reportedly averaged $1.8 million apiece. But to receive the money the families had to sign a waiver forfeiting the right to legal action.20 Report fails to explain how the phantom plane story the originated, $\\underline { { 2 1 } }$ in September 2006 Michael Bronner disclosed more details in a much-ballyhooed article in Vanity Fair magazine, “9/11 Live: The NORAD Tapes.” Bronner is a former producer of 60 Minutes and also helped produce the fi lm United 93. 22For reasons that have never been explained, the U.S. military blessed Bronner with", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:The 9_11 Mystery Plane - Mark H.

Although Bronner asserts that “the truth is all on tape,” there are solid reasons to question his arguments and conclusions. As part of his research, Bronner interviewed Colin Scoggins, who on September 11, 2001 was the military liaison at the FAA’s Boston Air Traffi c Center, where much of the action occurred. Scoggins told Bronner the phantom plane story began as a misunderstanding during a teleconference “in the fl urry of information zipping back and forth … [and] … transmogrifi ed into the idea that a different plane had hit the tower, and that American 11 was still hijacked and still in the air.”24 Although the 9/11 Commission Report does not mention Scoggins by name, it was he who made the crucial call to NEADS at 9:24 A.M. informing the military that Flight 11 was heading toward Washington. 25When I conducted my own interview with Scoggins in 2007, he acknowledged that Boston Center had tracked Flight 11 continuously until just north of the World Trade Center, but denied that the FAA ever tracked a phantom plane south of Manhattan. As Flight 11 approached the World Trade Center, it was then nearly out of range of Boston Center’s radar coverage. The plane was lost to radar at an altitude of just under 2,000 feet.26 In his article, Bronner tagged Scoggins with the responsibility for the mistaken report, but Scoggins told me he merely relayed what he had overheard during an FAA conference call. More details emerged during our interview and subsequent email exchanges. Scoggins thinks someone at FAA headquarters (which is located on Independence Avenue in downtown Washington) dropped a “call sign” during the 9/11 teleconference, meaning that during the discussion about hijacked planes someone failed to mention a fl ight number, leading to a mix-up. 27Numerous individuals from various agencies were on the line that morning. Scoggins doesn’t know exactly who or how many people were listening.

This would contradict the offi cial story that the military was in the dark. Scoggins doubts this interpretation, but it is certainly possible, because the Pentagon and NORAD were usual participants in FAA conference calls. This was confi rmed by the FAA’s Deputy in Public Affairs Laura Brown in a May 2003 memo to the 9/11 Commission, in which Brown sought to clarify the FAA’s role. Her memo states, “Within minutes after the fi rst aircraft hit the World Trade Center [at 8:46 A.M.], the FAA immediately established several phone bridges that included FAA fi eld facilities, the FAA Command Center, FAA headquarters, DoD [the Department of Defense, i.e., the Pentagon and NORAD], the Secret Service, and other government agencies.” 28Notice, if Brown is correct, the FAA notifi ed the military much earlier than 9:24. The panel discussed Brown’s memo during its hearings. Richard Ben Veniste, one of the commissioners, even read it into the record.29 Yet, her memo is conspicuously absent from the 9/11 Commission Report. Why? The probable answer is that it contradicts the offi cial story that the U.S. military was out of the loop. Anyone who thinks the military was not on the line should review the enormous amount of evidence to the contrary assembled by David Ray Griffi n in Debunking 9/11 Debunking. Griffi n thinks the FAA phone bridge with the military actually started much earlier, indeed, as early as 8:20 A.M., and he is probably correct.30 Michael Bronner makes another serious charge in his Vanity Fair article. He claims that the operational commander of NORAD’s Northeast Sector (NEADS) was unable to deploy his fi ghters over Manhattan on September 11 because he encountered resistance from the FAA. With both WTC towers in fl ames, as Bronner tells it, the NEADS mission-crew commander Major Kevin Nasypany was intent on moving his F-15s into position to protect New York. The planes had fi nally been scrambled (at 8:52 A.M.) from Otis ANGB, on Cape Cod. According to Bronner, however, as they approached the city NEADS received “pushback” from FAA controllers, who were concerned that NORAD’s “fast-moving fi ghters” might collide with commercial passenger planes, hundreds of which were “in the area, still fl ying normal routes.” At this point the FAA ordered the Otis pilots to stand by in a holding pattern off Long Island.

Bronner is correct that the FAA had “the fi nal authority over the fi ghters as long as they [were] in civilian airspace,” and he is also correct that the FAA hesitated to allow NORAD fi ghters over New York City. What he fails to mention is that the FAA was simply doing its job — following long established rules in the interest of air safety. The danger was real enough. The airspace around New York is by far the most congested on the planet. Three international airports service the greater metropolitan area. Two of them, JFK and La Guardia, are east of Manhattan and the third, Newark Airport, is located in New Jersey, west across the Hudson. Flights arrive at these busy airports from all points on the compass and depart to all points on a continuous 24-hour basis. Although none of the associated fl ight corridors or holding patterns intersect the borough of Manhattan, moving the fi ghters safely into position meant routing them through some very congested airspace. 31Moreover, after the second impact at 9:03 A.M., local controllers began shutting down New York City air space, which added further complexity to an already diffi cult situation. This was no small concern. Robin Hordon, a pilot and former air traffi c controller who worked at the FAA’s Boston Center for eleven years, thinks Bronner’s article obfuscates the real issue, which is why NEADS did not scramble the Otis fi ghters much sooner. According to Hordon, the FAA response protocol for hijackings is quite different — and slower — than in the case of air emergencies. Ω³²He says Flight 11 should have been treated as an air emergency, in which case the scrambled fi ghters from Otis would have had priority. FAA controllers would have cleared the airspace ahead of the fi ghters, and they would have arrived in plenty of time to intercept Flight 11. By delaying to “pick up the phone” until after the FAA reverted to the more cumbersome hijack protocol, NEADS insured that its fi ghters would have a lower priority status, in accord with standard protocols, hence would have to wait their turn to transit through New York City airspace. Hordon believes the initial delay was part of a deliberate strategy to effect a standdown. The FAA was an easy scapegoat. orders, they watched the ominous plume billowing from the WTC, conspicuous from 70 miles away. $\\underline {", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:The 9_11 Mystery Plane - Mark H.

Indeed, a footnote buried in the report even suggests that the pilots from Otis took the initiative themselves. 35The note informs us that at 9:13 A.M., the pilots “told their Boston Center controller that they needed to establish a combat air patrol (CAP) over New York,” which they fi nally accomplished at 9:25 A.M., much too late to make a difference. $\\underline { { { 3 6 } } } \\mathrm { { I n } }$ a more recent account, author Lynn Spencer, who is a pilot herself, claims that Nasypany’s boss, Col. Robert Marr, the NEADS battle commander, grew so impatient with the delays that he used his authority to override the FAA. He did this by declaring an AFIO, that is, an “Agreement for Fighter Interceptor Operations,” a rarely-used provision that allows the military to enter FAA airspace without permission.37 Of course, by then it was too late to matter. Given the above, Bronner’s charge that the FAA obstructed and delayed NEADS on 9/11 is dubious. All of the evidence suggests that FAA controllers were begging for fi ghter protection. Colin Scoggins told me he made as many as forty calls to NEADS on the morning of September 11 trying to get fi ghters in the air. During some of these calls he attempted to persuade NEADS to scramble fi ghters from bases that were not offi cially on alert, such as the Pomona base near Atlantic City, which is much closer to New York than the NEADS alert base on Cape Cod (Otis ANGB). Pomona is the home of the Air National Guard’s 177th fi ghter wing, which was in the habit of launching F-16s almost every morning on training fl ights.38 The F-16s often practiced bombing runs over a remote stretch of New Jersey pine barrens. Scoggins knew about these almost daily training fl ights — his impulse was correct. As we now know, on the morning of September 11, F-16s from the 177th fi ghter wing were at that very moment taxiing on the runway at Pomona preparing for take off at 9 a.m., and could easily have been rerouted to Manhattan in just minutes.39 The 9/11 Commission Report mentions the", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:The 9_11 Mystery Plane - Mark H.

The report states, “… the [Boston] Center also tried to contact a former alert site in Atlantic City, unaware it had been phased out.”40 This is hogwash. Scoggins was well aware that the Pomona base was not offi cially on alert, but was rightly undeterred by this formality which under the circumstances was irrelevant. Given that a hijacking was believed to be in progress just a few miles up the coast, the fi ghters from the Pomona base could and should have been mustered without delay. While it is true they were unarmed, this should not have been a consideration, because a shootdown order is always a last resort in any event. Amazingly, instead of being scrambled the Pomona fi ghters were ordered to return to the hanger. 41 The 9/11 Commission Report’s misrepresentation of the call by Scoggins was a case of deception, and the same can be said of Bronner’s article, which we must conclude — was a carefully-crafted piece of disinformation. Unfortunately, ordinary citizens who know nothing about FAA protocols and no-fl y zones probably found it persuasive. Although Bronner claims to have heard thirty hours of NORAD tape, according to Scoggins most of those hours were probably “dead time”: empty tape. Scoggins thinks Bronner heard only snippets, about ten or eleven of which are mentioned in his article. It is also likely that the information Bronner received from NORAD was cherry-picked ahead of time to convey the desired impressions. Scoggins thinks the snippets represent only a fraction of the 100-300 phone calls made on the morning of 9/11, not to mention FAA recordings and in-house tapes recorded by American and United Airlines. In short, there are excellent reasons to be wary of the picture Bronner paints. Only a comprehensive review of all of the recordings and radar data from 9/11 can reveal what actually happened. And this, I should add, has not been done, even to this day.42 Andrews Air Force Base, located just minutes by air from the White House, is another facility that NEADS could have mustered on 9/11.

The base is the home of Air Force One and has long been the usual port of entry to and from Washington for U.S. presidents and diplomats. Although it was not one of NORAD’s offi cially designated alert bases on 9/11, at least two combat-ready fi ghter units were based there, including a DC Air National Guard (DCANG) squadron of the 113th fi ghter wing. The 113th’s mission, as stated on the Andrews website, was to provide “capable and ready response forces for the District of Columbia.”43 On a separate page the DCANG squadron boasted about providing “combat units in the highest possible state of readiness.”44 The 321st Marine Fighter Attack Squadron was also based at Andrews and fl ew the sophisticated F/A-18 Hornet.45 Nor was Andrews the only response-capable facility in the area. The Patuxent Naval Base in Maryland also had fi ghters. In fact, on September 11 former Secretary of Defense Casper Weinberger told FOX News, “The city [Washington] is ringed with Air Force bases and Navy bases, and the ability to get defensive planes in the air is very, very high.” 46But strangely, not on 9/11. As we know, some of the DCANG fi ghters were away at the time of the attack, participating in a military exercise in North Carolina, and this delayed their response. During a teleconference that morning convened by counter-terrorism czar Richard A. Clark, General Richard Myers appeared to take credit for rousting these fi ghters when he explained that F-16 fi ghters from the DCANG squadron at Andrews had fi nally been scrambled.47 Myers failed to mention that it was not the Pentagon who mustered them, but the Secret Service. 48The DCANG F-16s arrived over Washington even later than the fi ghters from Langley, too late to matter. This story about Andrews has a postscript. Soon after the 9/11 attack 9/11 truth investigators discovered that someone had scrubbed the DCANG webpage from the Internet, including its mission statement about “providing combat units in the highest possible state of readiness.”49 Fortunately, several months before 9/11 the page had been archived, so the key information can still be viewed on line. 50Several others had already reported the facts in this case, but the story bears frequent repeating because it involves the destruction of important evidence.

Scoggins told me he gave them “nav aids,” that is, commonly used reference points, even precise latitude and longitude coordinates, in short, all of the necessary information, but to no avail. Lt. Col. Dawne Deskins, who worked at NEADS and was on the receiving end of his call, told FOX News exactly what Scoggins told me: “He [Scoggins] gave me the latitude and longitude of that track … but there was nothing there.” 51NEADS’s failure to locate Flight 11 haunts Scoggins to this day because, he says, the plane was moving at 600 mph and should have been conspicuous on radar. The anomaly has never been explained. (Nor was it a lone case. As we will discover later, there were also other radar anomalies on 9/11.) Getting to the bottom of it should have been one of the priorities of the offi cial 9/11 investigation. Yet, incredibly, the 9/11 Commission Report barely mentions the issue. Instead of doing its job, i.e., digging for the truth, the commission meekly accepted the Pentagon’s various excuses, usually without a word of protest. The generals found various ways to dump on the FAA. Their excuses ranged from General McKinley’s simple one-liner, “We are dependent on the FAA”52 to convoluted statements by General Arnold, including this one: “Everything that we were doing, remember, was being relayed from the FAA. We had no visibility on those aircraft, couldn’t see, we had no radars, couldn’t talk to our pilots.” At times, the generals were evasive, dodging direct questions instead of answering them. When commissioner John F. Lehman asked Arnold, “Why did they [i.e., the Langley fi ghters] go out to sea?” the NORAD general served up this word salad: When we scramble an aircraft, there is a line that is picked up, and the FAA and everyone is on that line. And the aircraft take off and they have a predetermined departure route. And, of course, it’s not over water, because our mission, unlike law enforcement’s mission, is to protect things coming towards the United States. And I might even add, in all of our terrorist scenarios that we run, the aircraft, if we were to intercept aircraft, it is usually always from outside the United States coming towards us. So our peace-time procedures, to deconfl ict with civil aviation’s, so as not have endanger [sic] civil aviation in any particular way. 52 Arnold’s answer was borderline gibberish.

(By the way, I triple-checked his syntax just to be sure I got it right.) But if the general meant to dissemble, he succeeded. To be sure, his reply did contain one of the military’s favorite lines: NORAD could not protect America because it was confi gured to “look outward” for foreign threats, rather than inward. 53General Richard Myers gave the same excuse the following year when he told the commission, “We were looking outward. We did not have the situational awareness inward because we did not have the radar coverage.”54 Here, the general raised an interesting point. Students of 9/11 have often puzzled over the extended westerly fl ight paths of Flights 77 and 93, which do seem strange and irrational from the standpoint of terrorists bent on crashing planes into buildings, because these long detours exposed the alleged hijackers to countermeasures. The routes increased the odds that the planes would be intercepted, diminishing the chances for a successful attack. Would real terrorists have done this? Very doubtful. From a different point of view, however, the chosen fl ight paths make perfect sense. Assuming the 9/11 attack was staged or assisted by insiders, the long detours conveniently took the “hijacked” planes outside the range of NORAD’s longrange radar towers situated on the east coast, essentially dumping the issue of radar coverage back into the FAA’s lap. Was this done by design, to lay the basis for the cover story, i.e., that NORAD could not see because “we were looking outward”? Although this is speculation, if correct it means the truth is simpler than many of us have supposed. As it happened, General Myers’ statement prompted one of the panel’s few fi ner moments. Commissioner Jamie Gorelick, a former legal counsel to the Department of Defense, evidently had boned up on military doctrine since the previous hearing. She knew the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs was pulling a fast one and, to her credit, Gorelick rose to the occasion. She corrected Myers, pointing out that the NORAD charter says no such thing. In fact, NORAD is charged with “control of the airspace above the domestic U.S.” in addition to defending against external threats. At this, Myers responded with an absurdity, citing the Posse Comitatus Act, which prohibits the U.S. military from domestic law enforcement. This surely exasperated Gorelick because she again politely interrupted Myers with another correction, pointing out that the “Posse Comitatus Act says you can’t arrest people.

There is not a word in the fi nal report about Gorelick’s important point, and nothing about her exchange with Myers. Incredibly, the report borrows the very phraseology used by Myers. One passage reads, “America’s homeland defenders faced outward”56 One of the generals’ lamest excuses was that NORAD could not track the hijacked planes after the transponders went off because of antiquated radar equipment. During his October 2001 testimony to the Senate Armed Services Committee, General Ralph Eberhart had described NORAD’s command-andcontrol systems as “’70s and ’80s technology.” He went on: “[NORAD’s technology] really hasn’t kept pace over the years. So we need to bring those into the 21st century. ^(, 957) Later, General Arnold told the commission basically the same thing. “Our resources were extremely limited in many cases,” he said, “because we initially could not even see what the FAA could see …”58 The statement was untrue, but the panel swallowed it unreservedly. Radar is the NEADS controllers’ most vital piece of equipment, but by 9/11 the scopes were so old, among other factors, that controllers were ultimately unable to fi nd any of the hijacked planes in enough time to react. Known collectively as the Green Eye for the glow the radar rings give off, the scopes looked like something out of Dr. Strangelove and were strikingly anachronistic compared with the equipment at civilian air-traffi c sites.59 Dramatic: but irrelevant. Yes, NEADS was using older hardware on 9/11, but so what? Colin Scoggins confi rmed to me that NEADS could see everything the FAA could see, and more.60 The military radar was adequate, and former FAA air traffi c controller Robin Hordon says the same thing. He explained to me that although NEADS was using older scopes on 9/11, the quality of the radar data that was being input had never been higher, as a result of continual upgrades in radar technology, of which NORAD has the world’s best.61 Another whopper was Bronner’s claim that NEADS technicians “were at a loss” because Flight 11 had ceased transmitting a transponder signal.", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:The 9_11 Mystery Plane - Mark H.

Bronner’s point was that NEADS needed the signal to locate the plane. More nonsense. This is what Scoggins was referring to when he mentioned that NEADS could see “everything the FAA saw, and more.” Unlike the FAA’s radar, NORAD does not need a transponder code to track a plane. If it did, as David Griffi n has pointed out, the Soviets could easily have mounted a sneak attack against the United States during the Cold War any time they liked, simply by turning off their military transponders.62 But perhaps the most fl agrant example of deception in the Vanity Fair article is the statement by NEADS commander Major Kevin Nasypany, who told Bronner, “You would see thousands of green blips on your scope. And now you have to pick and choose. Which is the bad guy out there? Which is the hijacked aircraft? And without that information from the FAA, it’s a needle in a haystack.”63 Once again, not true. In fact, it is for this very reason that each radar scope at NORAD shows only a small portion of the total area in the region: precisely so that technicians will not be overwhelmed by blips. And the FAA is set up the same way. This was confi rmed to me by Robin Hordon, who said he was so infuriated by Bronner’s deceptions that he could no longer keep silent.64 After the September 2006 Vanity Fair article, Hordon began to speak out about 9/11 and has been doing radio interviews ever since.65 NEADS’ failure to locate Flight 11 on radar had the serious consequence of slowing down its response time, because Col. Marr, the NEADS battle commander, was reluctant to scramble fi ghters from Otis ANGB without a target. However, if delay was the object, the outcome was a “suc cess,” not a failure of intelligence or military readiness. Major Nasypany was a benefi ciary of the Bush administration’s war on terrorism. The major was later “punished” for his unit’s failed performance on 9/11 with a promotion and pay raise. Of course, there will always be winners and losers in time of war.

It is always a misguided policy, and in this case was symptomatic of an even more serious malady: failed leadership at the highest level of government, the same “leadership” — I should add — that is responsible for the deepening quagmires in Iraq and Afghanistan. NORAD’s multiple failures on September 11, 2001 led Robin Hordon and others to suspect that a stand-down order was in effect. The 9/11 Commission added fuel to this fi re by failing to satisfactorily answer key questions, such as the fi asco of the scrambled fi ghters from Langley AFB. The 9/11 Commission Report suggests that the lead pilot from Langley misunderstood his orders. 67Yet, another passage elsewhere in the report states that the pilots were never briefed. As one pilot later explained, “I reverted to the Russian threat,” meaning that in the absence of an order he defaulted to “plan B,” a backup order. 68 Does this explain the holding pattern over the Atlantic? Certainly the screw-up was a “red fl ag” and cried out for further investigation. In a military chain of command, the responsibility for issuing orders rests with ranking offi cers. Therefore, if orders were never issued, someone had to be responsible, and that individual may have been derelict in his duty. Here, then, was a golden opportunity for the offi cial investigation to discover what really happened. All the panel had to do was interrogate the Langley pilots and trace the orders (or lack of them) back up the food chain. The panel had a mandate to “provide the fullest possible account.” It also had the authority to issue any subpoenas that were necessary. So, where are the transcripts of these crucial interviews, which apparently were conducted behind closed doors? The transcripts have never been made public and are nowhere to be found in the 9/11 Commission Report. Did the commission shield highranking offi cers from scrutiny — and accountability? Of course, an insider familiar with FAA protocols, NORAD, and the military’s rules of engagement would have known how to manipulate the system and get away with it. Were honest radar technicians confused on September 11 by phony blips on their radar screens? Were genuine radar signals secretly scrubbed by hackers participating in war games? Perhaps there was something, after all, to Major Nasypany’s complaint about “thousands of green blips.” Was this an oblique reference to military exercises?

Fighters had been dispatched to northern Canada, Iceland, Turkey and also to North Carolina, as noted, which reduced the number of available assets in the event of an emergency. I was shocked to learn that at least one of the exercises involved simulated hijackings. Another included an accidental (non-terrorist) plane crash into a building.70 In a 2002 interview, NORAD General Larry Arnold affi rmed that at the start of the September 11 attack his command was in the midst of one such exercise, Vigilant Guardian. The general’s fi rst reaction on hearing the news about Flight 11 was “It’s part of the exercise!” 71This speaks volumes. Nor was Arnold alone. His reaction was typical. When NEADS commander Major Nasypany learned about Flight 11, he thought someone had started the exercise early. He told Michael Bronner that he was so surprised he even thought out loud, “The hijack’s not supposed to be for another hour.” 72Snippets from the NORAD tapes include the similar surprised replies of other NEADS technicians, including Jeremy Powell, who asked Boston Center, “Is this real-world or exercise?” 73Bronner writes that Vigilant Guardian involved “a range of scenarios, including a ‘traditional’ simulated hijack in which politicallymotivated perpetrators commandeer an aircraft, land on a Cuba-like island, and seek asylum.” But is this more smoke and mirrors? In 2006, an army sergeant fl atly contradicted Bronner with information about Vigilant Guardian. Sergeant Lauro “L.J.” Chavez claimed that on September 11, 2001 he was stationed at McDill AFB in Tampa, Florida, home of the Central Command (CENTCOM), the joint headquarters for all U.S. military forces in the Middle East, East Africa, and Central Asia. Chavez said he is a computer expert and at the time ran a team of technicians who serviced all of the offi ce computers at CENTCOM, including those used by (four-star) General Tommy Franks, the ranking offi cer and regional commander. Due to the nature of his work Chavez held a top secret clearance and enjoyed free access to the most secure parts of the base. He claimed that on September 10, 2001 he was providing computer support within a secure command post when by chance he happened to see something he was not supposed to.74 One of the senior offi cers had left a top-secret document open on the desk beside the computer that Chavez was servicing.

As he waited for software to download, Chavez couldn’t help but read it. He says the document pertained to Vigilant Guardian and outlined various hijack scenarios that were anything but “traditional.” The scenarios included crashing hijacked planes into a nuclear reactor in California, the Sears tower in Chicago, and, yes, also the World Trade Center, Pentagon and White House. But Chavez was even more surprised that the details were classifi ed top secret. In his experience this was most unusual. Chavez claims that over the course of his army career he participated in a number of war games and military exercises, but not one of them was designated top secret except for this one case on 9/11. Normally, the Pentagon provides at least a modicum of information to the FAA and other public/state agencies about planned military exercises, for reasons that should be obvious and have to do with air safety and commerce. This is especially true when military drills occur in heavily populated areas. If Vigilant Guardian’s hijack scenarios on September 11, 2001 were classifi ed as top secret, the question we should be asking is: Why? I must mention here that after Lauro Chavez went public with the above testimony, he came under intense attack by Internet debunkers who accused him of being an impostor and of faking his military record. I must acknowledge that I have been unable to determine the truth in the matter, despite strenuous efforts to do so. Nonetheless, I have decided to include his testimony in this discussion, with this caveat, because I fi nd his story plausible. Nor does it stand alone. In fact, similar information had already come to light: In April 2004, just days after National Security Adviser Condoleezza Rice explained to the 9/11 Commission that the White House never anticipated that hijacked planes might be used as weapons, a watchdog group released a NORAD document proving otherwise.75 The document confi rmed that in the period prior to 9/11, the U.S. military did indeed contemplate hijack scenarios involving crashes, i.e., planes used as weapons. Unlike the hijackings on 9/11, most of these proposed scenarios involved planes originating from foreign airports. The hijackings were to occur before the planes entered U.S. airspace. Even so, at least one hijack exercise in July 2001 involved departures from Utah and Washington state. In a written statement NORAD acknowledged that the threats of killing hostages or crashing planes had been left up to the scriptwriters who developed the drills. There was no indication", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:The 9_11 Mystery Plane - Mark H.

In a written statement NORAD acknowledged that the threats of killing hostages or crashing planes had been left up to the scriptwriters who developed the drills. There was no indication whether any of these hijack exercises had been classifi ed top secret. In this respect the information about Vigilant Guardian released by Lauro Chavez in 2006 was qualitatively different and potentially more ominous. Obviously, the 9/11 Commission should have thoroughly investigated the military exercises that were in progress on 9/11, in order to “provide the fullest possible account” of the events of that day. Instead, as we know, the panel made a decision not to go there. The only reference to the drills in the fi nal report is a single passing remark about Vigilant Guardian buried in a footnote.76 It is yet another powerful indication of a failed investigation. Lauro Chavez also claims that on the day of the attack he personally witnessed evidence of a stand-down. $\\underline { { 7 7 } } \\mathrm { { H e } }$ says he was in a CENTCOM command post when the word came through about the World Trade Center: All at once there was a buzz of activity. Someone switched on CNN, and they were watching the events on a large screen. The second strike occurred, and suddenly everyone in the room was on his feet. Chavez heard many people say, “Why aren’t they scrambling jets?” Colonels and Lt. Colonels crowded around the Air Force liaison offi cer, wanting to know: “Where are the fi ghters from NORAD?” According to Chavez the Colonel said, “We received an order to standdown.” This, of course, perplexed everyone. Chavez says he also witnessed unusual security measures the day before the attack: CENTCOM headquarters was being heavily fortifi ed, and access to the base was restricted to personnel with top-secret clearances. But the most compelling evidence for a stand-down on 9/11 was presented by Secretary of Transportation Norman Mineta during his 2003 testimony before the 9/11 Commission. Mineta told the panel that on 9/11 he arrived at the PEOC (the presidential bunker under the White House) at 9:20 A.M., where he joined Vice President Cheney, who was already present. Incidentally, this time of 9:20 A.M. fl atly contradicts the offi cial narrative, which claims that Cheney did not arrive until shortly before 10 A.M.. $\\underline { { 7 8 } } \\mathrm { A }$ few minutes later, Mineta overheard a conversation, the signifi cance of which he says he failed to comprehend at the time.

At 9:25-26 A.M., a young man came in and warned Cheney about an incoming aircraft. The warning was repeated several times. Initially, the plane was 50 miles out, then 30 miles out. Finally, in Mineta’s own words: In the hearing, Mineta identifi ed this incoming aircraft as the plane that hit the Pentagon, presumably AA Flight 77. He was explicit on this point. He told the commission that, in his opinion, the young man and vice president were referring to a shoot-down order. But, of course, this makes absolutely no sense. Given the context and the fact that the bogey was not shot down, the exchange can only refer to a stand-down. Obviously, the technician had been tracking the incoming aircraft on radar, which, of course, means that the presidential command center was equipped with a real-time radar link to the FAA and possibly NORAD. I hasten to add: This is not controversial. Multiple sources have confi rmed the radar link, including the Washington Post, 80as well as counter-terrorism czar Richard A. Clarke, who mentions it in his 9/11 memoir. 81 The link was even confi rmed by VP Cheney himself during a September 16, 2001 interview on Meet the Press. On live television Cheney told Tim Russert that “the Secret Service has an arrangement with the FAA. They had open lines after the World Trade Center was …”82 Here, Cheney stopped abruptly in midsentence, as if catching himself before revealing too much. No question, Norman Mineta’s testimony challenges the offi cial explanation that the Pentagon was not informed about Flight 77, because if Cheney knew, so did some in the U.S. military. In fact, during the Russert interview Cheney stated that while in the bunker he was in contact with Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld, who was then at the Pentagon. $\\underline { { 8 3 } } \\mathrm { I t }$ is astonishing that the U.S. media missed this connection. Notice, Mineta’s testimony also places Cheney at the epicenter of events, and this fl atly contradicts the offi cial story that the vice president did not arrive at the command center until much later. Obviously, the offi cial timeline is a fabrication designed to shield Cheney by distancing him from events.

He was a civil servant, after all, not a neocon, the only Democrat in Bush’s cabinet. With the benefi t of hindsight, it certainly appears that the White House responded to this “threat” by attempting to head off trouble. Late in 2001, the well-known journalist Bob Woodward was summoned by the White House and invited to write a retrospective series of articles about September 11, as seen through the eyes of the president and his staff. Woodward was only too happy to oblige and, as we know, he went on to serve for a time as Bush’s court historian. The result, beginning in January 2002, was a series in the Washington Post. 84His articles present a White House-friendly version of events, and one story recounts the famous episode in the bunker. In Woodward’s redacted version, however, Cheney has become the man of the hour who rises to the press of terrible events. The same young man approaches the VP and warns about the incoming airliner. But the timeline has been pushed back. Now it is nearly 10 A.M., and the plane is Flight 93, not Flight 77. The hijacked plane is 80 miles out, not 50. There is also another huge difference. Instead of a stand-down order, it is a shoot-down order. When the young man says, “There is a fi ghter in the area. Should we engage?” Cheney responds by making the tough call to shoot down the plane. But the young man hesitates. As narrated by Woodward, the tension in the room mounts and reaches a pitch. The plane is rapidly closing and is now only 60 miles out. The young man repeats the question, and again Cheney gives the command. But the young man still hesitates. “Does the order still stand?” he mumbles. Finally, Cheney snaps and says, “Of course it does!” Woodward’s redacted history is more colorful. The problem is that it is a complete fabrication. It does not even agree with the offi cial narrative presented in the 9/11 Commission Report, because at no time on September 11 did Flight 93 approach anywhere near as close as 60 miles to the White House — nor even 80.

Future generations of Americans will revile Cheney and the rest as traitors who usurped the Constitution and catapulted our nation into war after needless war, while devastating the U.S. economy. Unfortunately, the events of 9/11 have been so obscured that most Americans, including many who strongly oppose the Bush administration, have yet to unmask the offi cial narrative for what it is. There are countless examples, but let us take the case of Boston Globe reporter Charlie Savage, who won a Pulitzer Prize in 2007 for his book Takeover. 85 I do not question Savage’s ability as a writer. His book is a trenchant analysis of George W. Bush’s imperial presidency. The author’s critical faculties shine as he details how Dick Cheney and the neocons went about the business of expanding the power of the presidency at the expense of our constitutional framework. As a historian Savage shows a capable hand, that is, until he turns to the famous scene in the bunker on 9/11, when suddenly his critical faculties desert him. At a glance it is obvious that Savage learned everything he knows about 9/11 from Bob Woodward and the Washington Post, which he apparently views as gospel, or, at any rate, good enough. Someone needs to inform Savage — he seems unable to make the connection — that it is only a single step from the subtitle of his book, i.e., the Subversion of American Democracy, to the cold-blooded murder of 3,000 of our fellow citizens for the purpose of galvanizing the nation behind the imperial president and the neocons’ push for world domination. Which, after all, was never a secret. But what does it say about our political culture that a writer like Savage can get his facts wrong, yet still win a Pulitzer? At very least, I think it tells us that Adolph Hitler made a disturbingly accurate insight into human nature when he wrote in Mein Kampf, “The great mass of the people will more easily fall victims to a great lie than to a small one.” I think it also tells us that the judgment of history belongs to the future. For the present, this remains our problem — and our challenge. At the time Scoggins was not himself tracking the plane on radar. When he placed this call, as before, he was merely relaying information that he believes originated at the FAA’s Washington headquarters.

When he placed this call, as before, he was merely relaying information that he believes originated at the FAA’s Washington headquarters. According to the 9/11 Commission Report (p. 27), this call sparked a frenzy: NEADS responded by immediately redirecting the Langley fi ghters to Washington. As the reader will learn in subsequent chapters, however, this is a fable. No such response occurred. The 9/11 Commission Report also implies that this unidentifi ed plane at 9:36 A.M. was AA Flight 77. Supposedly, the call at 9:36 A.M. was NORAD’s fi rst notifi cation of its approach, roughly two minutes (or less) before the crash. Michael Bronner also repeats these assertions in his Vanity Fair article about the NORAD tapes. Yet during our interview, Scoggins told me that at the time he had no idea about the identity of the plane. Later, like everyone else, he simply assumed it was Flight 77. Scoggins says he was also under the impression that it passed near the White House. Scoggins is not alone in this. Even today, many Americans probably believe that Flight 77 made a loop over Washington before striking the Pentagon. White House spokesman Ari Fleischer actually gave rise to one of these stories, which were widely reported in the media.87 The reality, however, is that at no time on September 11 was Flight 77 six miles southeast of the White House. A glance at a map will show that the Potomac River lies directly south of the presidential mansion. This means that the unidentifi ed plane Scoggins reported at 9:36 A.M. was over Maryland at the time, and this rules out Flight 77. We know this from an abundance of evidence, including eyewitness accounts, radar data, and the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) fl ight path study of Flight 77, which was released in August 2006. 88Although critics have identifi ed major problems with the NTSB study, these pertain to the fi nal approach of whatever hit the Pentagon, and have nothing to say about its general fl ight path, which remains uncontroversial. The bogey generally approached from the west before veering south to complete its now-famous downward spiraling 330-degree loop over Alexandria, during which the aircraft lost roughly 5,000 feet in altitude (dropping from 7,000 feet to about 2,000 feet).

In fact, because of the issues raised about the NTSB study, some skeptics hold that the plane never even hit the Pentagon, but passed over it and simply fl ew away. They argue that the damage to the building was caused by a missile, or pre-set explosives. While I am open to the likelihood of explosions, because witnesses reported the smell of cordite, I view the fl y-over scenario as implausible because it cannot explain the broken light poles in the approach path. At 8:56 A.M., as Flight 77 completed the westward leg of its fl ight path on 9/11, its transponder was turned off, and moments later the plane was lost to primary radar. Eight minutes later, a blip suddenly appeared on radar over West Virginia. Most have interpreted this as the reappearance of Flight 77. However, this conclusion remains an assumption, because the aircraft in question was not transmitting a transponder signal at the time. Nor was there any subsequent radio contact with the pilot. For these reasons, the identity of the aircraft that struck the Pentagon was never positively reestablished. It was probably Flight 77, but we cannot be certain, because the U.S. military has never released the serial numbers from the wreckage, which would positively identify the aircraft. Furthermore, the three short video clips of the impact from the Pentagon security caeras which have thus far been released (out of an estimated total of 85) are inconclusive. 89For these reasons, I will employ a writer’s device to convey this uncertainty, and will refer to the aircraft as Flight 77(?). ⁵³ General Eberhart gave this excuse during a hearing before the Senate Armed Services Committee, chaired by Senator Carl Levin, October 25, 2001.

At 9:30 A.M. on the morning of 9/11, Stephenson received a call from the Secret Service warning him that an unidentifi ed aircraft was approaching Washington from the west at high speed. Stephenson quickly checked his scope and located the plane on radar about 5 miles west of the city. He then looked out the window and actually saw the aircraft approaching. He watched it turn south and make a 330-degree looping spiral, descending all the while. The plane came back around and passed out of view behind some tall buildings in Crystal City, immediately south of the Pentagon. Stephenson then witnessed a huge fi reball.

I will discuss the radar data in chapter four. As the eyes of the nation were focused on the gruesome events at the World Trade Center, the networks interrupted their 9/11 television coverage with a breaking story from Washington. A large plane had just been sighted over the White House. Exactly when it fi rst appeared over the city is uncertain, but the reports aired shortly after the Pentagon strike. Witnesses who saw the plane say it circled over Washington. ABC anchor Peter Jennings was the fi rst journalist to mention the mysterious plane, which he did on air at 9:41 A.M. We know the time because a digital clock was embedded in the screen during ABC’s coverage. Here is what Jennings said: “The White House, of course, is–is–is–has leapt to the forefront of people’s concern this morning. And there is a plane circling the White House at the moment. And they’re clearing the grounds there…. We’ve had incidents, as you know, in the past, several years ago where a small aircraft landed in the White House–in the White House garden and the pilot mentally deranged, as I recall at the time, was killed. But the White House is certainly– certainly been very heavily defended. And this plane circling the White House adds to the trauma that people are feeling today, but we have no idea precisely what that means.”1 CNN’s Senior White House correspondent John King was across the street from the White House, in Lafayette Park, when he saw the plane. At about 9:53 A.M., King reported live that “about 10 minutes ago, there was a white", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:The 9_11 Mystery Plane - Mark H.

At about 9:53 A.M., King reported live that “about 10 minutes ago, there was a white jet circling overhead. Now, you generally don’t see planes in the area over the White House. That is restricted air space. No reason to believe that this jet was there for any nefarious purposes, but the Secret Service was very concerned, pointing up at the jet in the sky.”2 Kate Snow, another CNN correspondent, was standing two blocks from the Capitol when she saw the plane. Snow also mentioned it on-air, adding that a security guard told her it was responsible for the decision to evacuate the seat of government. Ω_(In)³ his 9/11 memoir Against All Enemies, counter-terrorism czar Richard A. Clarke writes that the decision to evacuate the White House was made after the Secret Service issued a warning about the approach of an unidentifi ed aircraft.4 But Clarke does not specify whether he means Flight 77, or this other mysterious aircraft. NBC host Katie Couric was covering the unfolding events at the World Trade Center when she interrupted her broadcast at about 9:54 A.M. with a live report from Bob Kur, the network’s senior Washington correspondent. Kur was at the White House, and he described the tense evacuation then in progress: “Administrators, cooks, whatever, running at a fairly high speed all of the way out of the building, through the top gates. Then we huddled for a while in Lafayette Park, across the street. And we’ve been moved, now, from there a block or so away. The offi ces along Jackson Place which are across the street from the White House and adjacent to Lafayette Park also have been evacuated. And in the most surreal of this morning’s scenes here at the White House, a white plane, a very big jet, was fl ying an unusual pattern near the White House over Lafayette Park. Very slowly it made one circle and then, we have not seen it since [my emphasis]. There was a lot of concern about what this plane might be. But, again, it’s only speculation. But most people say that since fl ights have been cleared from U.S. air space, and it was a totally white plane, looked unusual to all of us, that it was a government plane of some kind.”5 At 9:59 A.M. Couric again mentioned Kur’s “haunting” report from the White House. In fact, she was in mid-sentence when all attention shifted due to the sudden collapse of the South Tower.

The sighting of a large white plane over the White House on September 11, 2001 was noteworthy. As mentioned by John King and Peter Jennings, the airspace over Washington is very tightly restricted. In fact, it’s probably the most restricted airspace on the planet. At the time of the attack, the prohibited zone, known as area P-56, extended in all directions from the Washington Monument. 7The no-fl y zone included the Pentagon and much of the city of Washington, and was closely monitored by FAA radar. Every plane entering this area would have been detected immediately and if not identifi ed should have activated Washington’s air defenses. The Secret Service would also have been alerted, because, as I mentioned in the previous chapter, the agency had a direct feed to FAA radar. The core of P-56 is centered around the White House and stretches from the Potomac River to the Capitol. A separate area known as P-56B surrounds the Vice Presidential mansion on the grounds of the Naval Observatory, near Wisconsin Avenue. Other than approved fl ights, no aircraft are allowed to fl y through these areas. One of Washington’s biggest security issues has always been the city’s close proximity to Reagan National Airport, which is in Arlington just west of the Potomac River. Reagan’s fl ight corridors follow the Potomac, directly adjoining this prohibited area. After a series of violations in the 1990s, the FAA and Secret Service jointly conducted a security review and arrived at a memorandum of understanding. In 1996 a “P-56 Work Group” was set up to review procedures and make recommendations, some of which were implemented. Nonetheless, occasional over-fl ights continued to be a problem. In July 1998, a scheduled American Airlines fl ight accidentally passed directly over the White House en route to Reagan Airport. The event prompted the airport manager to issue a stern warning to his fl ight controllers to “treat this area as a ‘Granite Mountain’ to be avoided in every possible way.” A similar letter was sent to pilots. Even so, there were occasional incidents in the period before the September 11 attack. Given all of this, it is not surprising that the sudden appearance of an unidentifi ed low-fl ying plane over the White House on 9/11 would set off alarms. Let us remember, by this time the World Trade Center was in fl ames. Hundreds of people had already perished.", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:The 9_11 Mystery Plane - Mark H.

Let us remember, by this time the World Trade Center was in fl ames. Hundreds of people had already perished. Multiple hijackings were believed to be in progress. The only planes with legitimate reason to be in the sky over Washington were fi ghters for the purpose of protecting the nation’s capital. Yet, as we know, Washington lay completely undefended. Scrambled F-16 fi ghters from Langley AFB did not fi nally establish a combat air patrol over the city until shortly before 10 A.M. — much too late — and subsequently, as we also know, the 9/11 Commission absolved the Joint Chiefs of all responsibility for this shocking breach of security. The panel put the blame squarely on the FAA, claiming it had failed to notify NORAD about the hijackings. But what about this mysterious white plane which circled over the president’s house? The fact that it penetrated to the core of P-56 raised obvious questions that the 9/11 Commission should have investigated. Incredibly, the panel never even broached the issue. There is no mention of the white plane and its strange fl y-over in the 9/11 Commission Report, not even a passing remark in a footnote. Nor is there any reference to the news stories cited above. Why not? After a crime, it is standard procedure for police detectives to interrogate witnesses who were at the scene and cross-check their testimony in an attempt to reconstruct what actually happened. Had the members of the 9/11 Commission been serious about their mandate to provide “the fullest possible account” 8of the horrifi c events of September 11, 2001, they would have followed this well-established procedure. Certainly the news reports carried by numerous networks and the many eyewitnesses at the White House merited attention. These were obvious starting points for the offi cial investigation. It was not necessary for the panel members to go above and beyond the call of duty. Had they merely done their job, they surely would have discovered the evidence I am about to present. This, in turn, would have prompted further inquiries, and, quite probably, some conclusions different from those in their fi nal report. After the collapse of the South Tower at 9:59 A.M., the U.S. media appeared to forget about the mysterious white plane. This was not due to a general lack of press coverage about 9/11. During this same period the networks featured numerous follow-up reports. As I have noted, leading newspapers such as the Washington Post ran lengthy retrospective articles.

During this same period the networks featured numerous follow-up reports. As I have noted, leading newspapers such as the Washington Post ran lengthy retrospective articles. However, with the exception of one indirect reference in Newsweek, there was no further mention of the strange fl y-over. The incident dropped out of history for six years. The U.S. military also ducked the issue. To this day, the U.S. Air Force claims that it has no knowledge of any such plane. Yet, as I will now show, an abundance of hard evidence conclusively refutes this offi cial denial. Like most Americans, I too was ignorant. I fi rst learned about the mystery plane only in March 2007. Days after posting an Internet article in which I professed skepticism about the offi cial 9/11 conspiracy theory, I received an email from an independent investigator who directed me to some remarkable evidence of which I was unaware. (The individual prefers to remain anonymous because he is currently pursuing several FOIA requests and does not wish to place them in jeopardy. I will refer to him by his Internet screen name: “Pinnacle.”) I was surprised to learn that the evidence had been around for quite some time. It seems that during the evacuation of the White House on September 11, a woman captured an amazing photo of the mysterious plane. Linda Brookhart, at the time Vice President of the Taxpayer Federation of Illinois, was in Washington on 9/11 attending a National Taxpayers Conference in the old Executive Offi ce Building (located immediately next to the White House) when she and many others were told to vacate the building. Ms. Brookhart later explained to me that after she hurried outside, she was standing in the street talking to a security guard when she just happened to look up and see a plane overhead.9 Reacting on impulse, she grabbed her Pentax and snapped the excellent quality photo on the front cover of this book (at the top, and shown here in black-and-white). This single photo refutes the Pentagon denials, and, as we are about to discover, it contains enough information to identify the plane. “Pinnacle” actually made the correct identifi cation as early as May 2006, based on this one photo. “Pinnacle” also guided me to other evidence. It seems the BBC fi lmed the mysterious plane as it circled over Washington, and the network aired this footage in a live report in the U.K. at 11:50 A.M. (EDT) on the day of the attack. Unfortunately, the footage is of rather poor quality. However, the Spanish", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:The 9_11 Mystery Plane - Mark H.

Unfortunately, the footage is of rather poor quality. However, the Spanish ABC network also captured similar footage, and they too aired a live report. The following excellent still-shot was taken from this video footage. Notice, the caption informs us in Spanish that a third hijacked plane hit the Pentagon. It also gives the initially-reported impact time: 9:43 A.M. The segments are similar and were probably fi lmed from Lafayette Park, across the street from the White House. But the best evidence was yet to come. It seems that a reporter at the White House captured an excellent video clip of the white plane as it made a banking turn. This short segment actually appeared in a two-hour made-for-TV docudrama about Flight 93, which aired on the Discovery Channel in August 2005: The Flight that Fought Back. Once alerted to its existence, I had no trouble locating this short segment on the Internet. A 9/11 investigator named Chris Bornag had pulled it from the fi lm and posted it at YouTube as part of a melange from 9/11. The clip has since been removed due to a copyright infringement. However, for many months it was viewable on line by anyone with access to cyberspace. The following still-shot was taken from this footage. A DVD of the original Discovery Channel movie is still available for purchase at Amazon.com. The crucial segment appears 47 minutes into the movie (in scene four). It is not a part of the dramatic production itself, but is a short segment of raw documentary footage embedded in the fi lm. The crucial segment is very brief, only about three- to four-seconds long. This probably helps to explain why this remarkable footage did not attract more attention. At that time I had seen no reference to it in any of the published literature about September 11, nor on any of the 9/11 websites. But I now understand that I simply missed it. An excellent dialogue about the white plane appeared in July 2006 on the Loose Change Forum, an Internet discussion board sponsored by 9/11 fi lm maker Dylan Avery. 10 As I have noted, the plane makes a banking turn in the video. The angle was lucky because it brought the plane’s unique features and markings into plain view. Make no mistake, this was no ordinary aircraft. It belongs to the U.S. Air Force.

There is no mistake. The plane is a modifi ed Boeing 747-200. Notice the white color, the U.S. fl ag painted on the vertical stabilizer (i.e, the tail), and the blue stripe and insignia on the fuselage. The distinguishing feature, however, is the bump or pod directly behind the bulging 747 cockpit. The pod is clearly discernible in photos. No other plane has this piggy-backed appendage. It is unique to the E-4B and is integral to its military role as a state-of-the-art airborne command center. The pod contains a communication satellite- dish and perhaps other advanced electronic hardware. This is the same plane Linda Brookhart photographed near the White House. How can we tell? Her vantage was not ideal — Ms. Brookhart was standing in the street looking up when she snapped the shot. Nonetheless, a careful inspection shows it to be the same plane. Notice, the aircraft in her picture has four engines and all of the characteristics of a Boeing 747. In addition to the white color, which is also a match, one other crucial detail establishes the identity. Notice the tiny blue spot near the rear of the plane. Several close-ups of an E-4B clearly show that this blue spot is simply the place where the blue stripes on the side of the fuselage come together at the rear of the aircraft. This spot can also be seen in the still-shot from the Spanish ABC network. No mistake. It is one and the same. Linda Brookhart explained to me that at the time of the evacuation she believed the White House was under attack. She was not the only one. Many others who were present, including government offi cials, felt the same way. On September 12, 2001, White House spokesperson Ari Fleischer told the press, “We have specifi c and credible information that the White House and Air Force One were intended targets of these attacks.” 13Attorney General John Ashcroft and Sean McCormack, representing the National Security Council (NSC), made similar statements. $\\underline { { 1 4 } } \\mathrm { S o }$ did Vice President", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:The 9_11 Mystery Plane - Mark H.

During the interview, Cheney told Tim Russert that Secret Service agents evacuated him on 9/11 after “they received a report that an airplane was headed for the White House.” 15Whatever Cheney’s role may have been, there is no reason to doubt this statement. Barbara Riggs, who was the Deputy Director of the Secret Service on 9/11 (the fi rst woman to hold that post), later offered another corroborating account. During a 2006 interview, Riggs stated that on September 11, 2001 she was in the Secret Service (SS) crisis center at agency headquarters, where she watched SS staff persons track two planes on radar, real-time. Both were approaching Washington. Riggs emphasized that everyone in the room at the time was operating under the assumption that the White House was a target.16 Her statement is also important because it confi rms the testimony of Secretary of Transportation Norman Mineta, discussed in the previous chapter. As noted, Mineta overheard a conversation in the White House bunker between VP Cheney and a young man, presumably a Secret Service staff person, who informed Cheney about an approaching plane. Later, Mineta identifi ed it as AA Flight 77. The second plane mentioned by Riggs was probably United Flight 93, but we can’t be certain. It might have been this mysterious white plane. If the E-4B’s transponder had been set to a military code unreadable to the FAA (or Secret Service), the plane would have been indistinguishable on radar from a commercial plane with its transponder off. In 2002, Presidential adviser Karl Rove indirectly corroborated this analysis. During an MSNBC interview Rove told NBC reporter Campbell Brown that when Bush left the classroom in Sarasota he immediately asked to be put in touch with the vice president.17 However, as Rove tells it, they were unable to reach Cheney right away because “the Vice President was being moved literally, grabbed by his belt, lifted off the fl oor … by a Secret Service agent and moved to the bunker because the plane was approaching the White House” [my emphasis].

The exact time when Bush left the classroom is contested, but it could not have been later than 9:16 A.M. This would easily place Cheney in the bunker by 9:20 A.M., or earlier, which fi ts well with Mineta’s timeline, and fl atly contradicts the offi cial story that Cheney arrived much later. Pandemonium at the White House/Bush in Sarasota udging from news reports, the scene at the White House was pandemonium. According to the Washington Post, the Secret Service ordered staffers to fi le out in an orderly way, then screamed at them to run as fast as they could across Pennsylvania Avenue to Lafayette Park. Women were told to remove their high-heeled shoes so they could run faster. Some did not even bother to collect their shoes. They stepped out of them and kept right on going. The nearby sidewalks were littered with women’s shoes. Other evacuees were advised “to remove the White House ID from around their necks so they couldn’t be singled out by possible snipers outside the White House gates.” 18This gives some idea of the tense atmosphere. It was no different on Capitol Hill, where House Speaker Dennis Hastert and other high offi cials were whisked to safety by security guards. Hastert later said two burly cops came up, grabbed him under each arm and carted him out of the building. Hastert, the third in line of succession, then fl ew by helicopter to Andrews AFB, where he and other cabinet offi cials boarded a plane to site “R,” the secure facility near Camp David where the continuity of government (COG) backup team assembled to ride out the crisis. Deputy Secretary of Defense Paul Wolfowitz was also a part of this group. Whereas VP Cheney and Speaker Hastert were hustled to safety by Secret Service agents, President Bush’s experience in Sarasota, Florida was strangely different. When United Flight 175 hit the South Tower, Bush was sitting in a classroom with second graders. At 9:06 A.M. Andrew Card, Bush’s chief of staff, came up and reportedly whispered in Bush’s ear, “A second plane hit the other tower. America is under attack.” By this point, the Secret Service should already have hustled Bush to safety. Given that the nation was under attack, an attempt on the president’s life was a very real possibility. After all, Bush’s presence at Booker Elementary school was no secret.

The press had widely reported his scheduled appearance. Standard procedure called for the Secret Service to remove the president to the nearest secure location, and this most defi nitely was not the school. In fact, Bush’s continuing presence at Booker put the children in danger. According to Philip Melanson, an expert on the Secret Service, “You’re safer in that presidential limo, which is bombproof and … bulletproof.” 19Yet, Bush’s handlers allowed him to remain in the classroom for another ten minutes while the children and Bush took turns reading “My Pet Goat.” This incredible lapse of security has never been explained. Even when Bush got up and left the class, his casual demeanor is hard to fathom. Bush dallied at the school, delivered a short speech at 9:30 A.M., which was aired on national TV, then posed for a photo-op. His motorcade did not leave Booker Elementary until 9:34 A.M. Later, Andrew Card stated that the president fi rst learned about the Pentagon strike and the threat to Air Force One during the short drive to the airport, which was 3-4 miles from the school.20 It was only then that the Secret Service kicked into gear. $\\underline { { 2 1 } }$ ABC News reporter Ann Compton, who was with Bush, called it “… a mad-dash motorcade out to the airport.” 22Kevin Down, a Sarasota police offi cer who was also present, described what he saw: “I thought they were actually anticipating a terrorist attack on the president while we were en route.” 23From these accounts, it would appear that Bush received the call about the Pentagon strike and Air Force One shortly after leaving Booker at 9:34 A.M. Notice, this is not a close fi t with the offi cial story that the Pentagon crash occurred at 9:37-38 A.M., because one would expect a delay of at least a few minutes. For example, during ABC’s live 9/11 coverage, which started at 8:51 A.M., Peter Jennings mentioned the plane circling the White House before he received word about the Pentagon strike. ABC’s correspondent John McWethy was at the Pentagon, but he apparently was being evacuated and was out of action. The fi rst indication of smoke came only at 9:42 A.M. Two minutes later Jennings mentioned a fi re. Then came word of a plane crash. The full story emerged in bits and pieces. By this time, there was genuine concern for Bush’s safety. USAF Col.

Mark Tillman, pilot of Air Force One, insisted on an armed guard at his cockpit door while the Secret Service ran an identity check on everyone aboard the presidential plane. At 9:57 A.M., when Tillman lifted off from Sarasota-Bradenton International Airport, he reportedly made a near vertical ascent. Dan Bartlett, the White House Communications Director, said, “It was like a rocket. For a good ten minutes the plane was going almost straight up.” ^( • 24) Once aloft, Tillman chose to forego radio, so as not to reveal his location, and communicated with FAA air traffi c controllers by telephone instead. President Bush even refused his planned fi ghter escort. Four F-16s from the Minnesota Air National Guard were left sitting on the tarmac at Tyndall AFB in northern Florida. Instead, Bush scrambled fi ghters from his old Texas Air National Guard unit. They caught up with him en route to Barksdale AFB, in Louisiana.25 The time of Bush’s departure from Booker school (i.e., 9:34 A.M.), the short distance to the airport, and the fact that part of the drive was at high speed — all raise questions about the offi cial story, including the actual time and circumstances of the Pentagon strike. The Washington Post reported that the White House evacuation commenced at 9:45 A.M. However, by some accounts it started much earlier. Apparently, people left in stages26 . Norman Mineta told the 9/11 Commission that the evacuation was already in progress when he arrived in the PEOC (i.e., the presidential bunker) at 9:20 A.M. 27Mineta said he spoke briefl y with Richard Clarke before descending into the bunker, and Clarke confi rms Mineta’s account in his 9/11 memoir.28 In a 9:52 A.M. live broadcast, CNN’s John King mentioned that the evacuation “had begun about 30 minutes ago.” ${ \\underline { { 2 9 } } } \\mathrm { A }$ story in Newsweek magazine reported that staffers were leaving the West Wing at 9:30 A.M. The time is important because the story also mentions the white plane, possibly linking its appearance with the evacuation. The Newsweek story mentions that security police urged staffers to “run, not walk, as fast as possible,” and shouted, “There’s a plane overhead, don’t look back!” Some caught a glimpse of it, but apparently no one recognized it.

Although none of the news reports cited above provide fi rm information about exactly when the E-4B was fi rst spotted, other accounts suggest the plane was already in the sky over Washington before the Pentagon strike. One of these reports aired in the U.K. two days after the attack. Mark Easton, anchor of Channel 4 News in England, reported that “just before the crash a civilian plane was fi lmed over the city apparently banking hard, and there were reports of a military plane circling the U.S. Capitol. Moments later, the Department of Defense [i.e., the Pentagon] was hit.”31 In a separate story, CNN reported that U.S. Army Brig. General Clyde Vaughn watched a commercial-size plane circle over Georgetown a few minutes before the Pentagon crash. At the time Vaughn was eastbound on Interstate 395, en route to the Pentagon. ${ \\underline { { 3 2 } } } \\mathrm { { I n } }$ Gen. Vaughn’s own words: “There wasn’t anything in the air, except for one airplane, and it looked like it was loitering over Georgetown, in a high left-handed bank.” The CNN story correctly mentions that Georgetown is a part of the District of Columbia and lies within the prohibited zone. As I have noted, commercial airliners arriving and departing from nearby Ronald Reagan avoid this area, including Georgetown. Instead, they follow the nearby Potomac River. ${ \\underline { { 3 3 } } } \\mathrm { { I t } }$ is important to remember that people in different parts of Washington probably saw the white plane at different times. Linda Brookhart says she snapped her photo before she saw the towering plume of smoke at the Pentagon. After returning home, she developed the fi lm and notifi ed the FBI. Days later, an agent came by and picked up a copy of the photo. But Brookhart did not hear back. She was never invited to testify. In fact, the 9/11 Commission never even contacted her. 34 With hindsight, this offi cial lack of interest is not surprising, given that the 9/11 Commission’s primary concern was to consolidate the offi cial conspiracy story.

However, we still do not know who fi lmed it. Nor does the footage include any visual evidence linking it to Washington. The segment is very brief and simply shows the E-4B banking against a backdrop of blue sky. For these reasons some have discounted it. Fortunately, it is not necessary to place undue weight on the Discovery Channel clip, because additional video evidence has since emerged that is even more compelling. In June 2007, “Pinnacle” was exploring CNN’s video archive when he stumbled upon previously unknown raw video footage of the E-4B circling the White House on 9/11. The footage was fi lmed on the morning of the attack by another CNN cameraman at the White House, but never aired on television. Instead, it gathered dust in the CNN archive for nearly six years.35 The 18-minute CNN video documents the White House evacuation and the fl yover in graphic fashion. When I learned about it, I contacted CNN and was able to acquire an unedited screener’s copy. Ken Jenkins, a video expert, then vetted the footage. He believes it is bona fi de.36 As it starts, the CNN cameraman and other members of the press are obviously on the White House grounds. A guard appears and instructs everyone to leave. As the camera rolls, the CNN reporter joins the exodus of journalists and staffers who are walking down the White House driveway. At this point, a voice is heard talking about “an explosion at the Pentagon.” The CNN cameraman then exits through the White House gate. In subsequent scenes, familiar Washington landmarks, including the old Executive Offi ce Building, Lafayette Park and Jackson Place, are plainly in evidence. Suddenly, there is the shrill sound of sirens. Moments later, two red fi re engines arrive in front of the White House, apparently in response to the fi re alarm reported by the Washington Post.37 About six minutes into the video, the camera suddenly pans up over Jackson Place and catches the white plane against a cloudless blue sky. As the camera zooms up, the four jet engines, white color, and even the blue spot on the fuselage, are all plainly visible.

From the video one can tell that the E-4B was fl ying at a slow speed, just as Bob Kur and General Vaughn claimed. The plane certainly appears to hang or “loiter” in the sky. Moving northeast, it banks and makes another much lower pass, fi lling about a fourth of the screen until it fi nally passes out of sight behind a large tree. In the bright sunlight, the blue stripe on the side of the plane and the communications pod behind the cockpit are plainly visible. Notice, this CNN close-up closely resembles the photo-grab from the Discovery Channel clip. The CNN video, however, is steadier and of better quality. The similarity is not surprising, because by this time security police had relocated the journalists from the White House to a press corral in Lafayette Park. Several of the existing segments of the E-4B were probably fi lmed from this same location. The total length of the E-4B segment in the CNN video is about twenty-nine seconds — much longer than any of the other known segments, which are only brief clips. Later in the video, Secret Service agents are seen moving around on the White House roof. About 8-9 minutes into the fi lm, smoke can be seen in the distance, behind the White House. At this point the camera shifts to several men standing on a sidewalk in Lafayette Park. They are using cell phones and apparently have just learned about the Pentagon strike. One says, “Did it actually hit the Pentagon?” Another voice says, “It’s unclear. There’s a fi re over there.” This dramatic CNN footage erases any shreds of doubt and proves that a U.S. Air Force plane, to be precise, an E-4B, circled over Washington at approximately the time of the Pentagon attack. (Required disclaimer: “Usage of this CNN material does not constitute an implied or express endorsement by CNN.”) More recently, additional evidence also came to light. We learned that the BBC captured yet another short video of the E-4B as it passed near the White House. This footage appeared in Clear the Skies, a 2002 BBC special report about the events of September 11. The special program aired on British television, but insofar as I know has never been shown in the U.S. Even so, the fi lm is commercially available at amazon.com.

Notice the white color, the four jet engines and the dot at the rear of the plane. 4B segment is very similar to the clips already discussed and was probably fi lmed from Lafayette Park. However, it is distinguished by an audio component proving that at least one journalist on the scene did positively identify the white plane. As the fi lm rolls, a voice can be heard saying, “It’s the doomsday plane!” Again, I must emphasize: this was no ordinary aircraft. The E-4B’s offi cial designation is the National Airborne Operations Center (NAOC), pronounced “Nay-ock.” In former years, however, it was known as the National Emergency Airborne Command Post (NEACP), pronounced “Kneecap.” But the more common name is the one heard in the BBC fi lm: the “doomsday plane,” so called because its premier function is to serve as a fl ying command, control and communications post in the event of nuclear war or during a national emergency. For this reason, the U.S. Air Force keeps an E-4B on alert at all times. A recent article in the Air Force Civil Engineer describes the plane as “a truly amazing” aircraft and provides more details about its impressive specs.38 The $800 million plane has all of the advanced electronics needed for worldwide communication. This explains the “E” in its name, which stands for “electronic.” The E-4B is not to be confused with the E-3 Sentry, which is the Pentagon’s Airborne Warning and Control System (AWACS) radar reconnaissance plane. Fortunately, the two are easy to distinguish. The E-3 AWACS is a modifi ed Boeing 707 — not a 747 — hence, is much smaller. The E-3 features a large radar dome (radome) attached above the fuselage, very different in appearance from the communications pod on the E-4B. If the presidential plane, Air Force One, is a fl ying White House, then the E-4B is a substitute Pentagon. Its electronics cover the full radio spectrum, from extremely low frequency (ELF) to ultra high frequency (UHF). This enables the E-4B to communicate worldwide with all U.S. military commands, including tactical and strategic forces, naval ships, planes, nuclear-armed missiles, even submarines. The plane is outfi tted with as many as 48 different antennae. One of these is wire-mounted on a spool at the rear of the aircraft. When in use, the wire is unreeled, dragging a small cone hundreds of feet behind the plane. In sum, the E-4B is a state-of-the-art communications platform and can serve as an airborne command center", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:The 9_11 Mystery Plane - Mark H.

When in use, the wire is unreeled, dragging a small cone hundreds of feet behind the plane. In sum, the E-4B is a state-of-the-art communications platform and can serve as an airborne command center for all U.S. military forces in a national or world crisis. The aircraft carries an electrical-generating plant to power all of its electronic hardware, which, incidentally, is also shielded against the electromagnetic pulse effects generated by nuclear explosions. The task of hardening the hundreds of miles of wiring in the plane was no small chore. According to a Boeing engineer who witnessed the work, braided shielding had to be installed around each and every wire bundle, which more than doubled the weight. The problem of shielding the pilots was solved in a novel way: The large windows in the forward cockpit were covered with the same screen mesh used in the windows of microwave ovens. Like Air Force One, the E-4B can be refueled in fl ight, and therefore has essentially unlimited range. It can remain aloft for days at a time. When the president travels on Air Force One, an E-4B usually follows behind the presidential entourage, close at hand for reasons of national security. Strangely, however, it seems this protocol was not followed on September 11, 2001. In Air War Over America, the offi cial U.S. Air Force account, author Leslie Filson writes that when Air Force One departed Sarasota-Bradenton airport, an AWACS plane was ordered to accompany the president.40 If an E-4B had been with Bush in Florida, this would not have been necessary. At the time, the AWACS plane was participating in a military exercise off the Florida coast. 41The U.S. government has never explained why a doomsday plane failed to accompany the president on September 11. The Air Force has a fl eet of four E-4Bs, one of which, as noted, is always on alert. Collectively they are known as the “Nightwatch.” The lead plane is designated as “Nightwatch-1,” but each E-4B also has its own radio call sign. 43Usually the fl eet is assigned to Offutt Air Force Base, near Omaha, Nebraska. But individual E-4Bs are occasionally stationed at other bases. By the way, Offutt is also the home of USSTRATCOM, i.e., the U.S. Strategic Command (formerly SAC, the Strategic Air Command). The Nightwatch fl eet is under the operational control of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, 44in other words, the national command authority. The E-4Bs are maintained by the First Airborne Command and Control Squadron, a part of the 55th Strategic Reconnaissance Wing.

The E-4Bs are maintained by the First Airborne Command and Control Squadron, a part of the 55th Strategic Reconnaissance Wing. The wing’s motto is Videmus Omnia, which is Latin for “We See All.” Each E-4B has a crew of 64, and the plane can accommodate an additional 50 passengers, for a total of 114. The spacious 747 fuselage includes command and work areas, conference and briefi ng rooms, as well as an operations center or battle station. The plane also has a rest area, bunks for sleeping, even a galley stocked with a week’s provisions. In 2005, the U.S. Air Force awarded Boeing Corporation a $2 billion contract to upgrade the Nightwatch fl eet — an enormous sum considering there are only four of the planes. The stated goal of the fi ve-year upgrade was “increased readiness.”45 According to the Omaha World-Herald, on the morning of the September 11 attack, three of the E-4Bs were participating in a live command-level exercise known as Global Guardian.46 The drill is an annual event, staged to test the readiness of the U.S. military’s command and control procedures involved in waging thermonuclear war. The 2001 Global Guardian exercise started the week before September 11, under the directorship of Admiral Richard Mies, commander-in-chief of USSTRATCOM. It was reportedly in “full swing” when the attack began. NORAD was also a participant, along with numerous other commands. Previous Global Guardian exercises have involved the U.S. Space Command, the Air Combat Command, and the U.S. Atlantic and Pacifi c Fleets, among others.47 Since the 1990s Global Guardian has included mock terrorist attacks upon the military’s computer and information systems. For example, during the 1998 exercise, a Red Team of mock terrorists attempted to disrupt USSTRATCOM’s internal communications by hacking into its computers, and by tying up its phone/FAX lines with phony messages.48 Although the details were not released, the staged “terrorist attacks” apparently were at least partly successful. Recent Global Guardian exercises have also included this sort of “attack” scenario. 49Although the U.S. military has released few details about the 2001 Global Guardian exercise, we know that in previous years the drill included the loading of live nuclear weapons onto planes. This is troubling, especially in light of the August 2007 snafu at Minot AFB, which involved serious violations of longstanding Air Force protocols about the handling of nuclear weapons: A half-dozen nuclear-armed cruise missiles from Minot were “mistakenly” loaded under the wings of a B-52, then fl own to Barksdale AFB, one of the embarkation points for U.S. troops and materiel en route to the Mideast.

This is troubling, especially in light of the August 2007 snafu at Minot AFB, which involved serious violations of longstanding Air Force protocols about the handling of nuclear weapons: A half-dozen nuclear-armed cruise missiles from Minot were “mistakenly” loaded under the wings of a B-52, then fl own to Barksdale AFB, one of the embarkation points for U.S. troops and materiel en route to the Mideast. It is likely that Global Guardian was the umbrella exercise for several other military drills also underway on 9/11, including Vigilant Guardian. 50Even the names suggest a set of tiered exercises. A FEMA drill named Tripod was also in progress on 9/11 in New York City, and it too may have been tiered to Global Guardian. Tripod involved hundreds of government employees and its purpose, according to NYC mayor Rudy Giuliani, was to defend against a hypothetical biochemical attack. 51Involvement of the E-4B in Tripod is quite likely, because one of the doomsday plane’s secondary roles is to serve as a mobile command center for use by FEMA during national emergencies.52 Although the fl ying command post apparently played no role in the Katrina disaster, FEMA is known to have used an E-4B during hurricane Opal in 1995. Yet us now review the whereabouts of the Nightwatch fl eet on 9/11. According to the Omaha World-Herald, one of the E-4Bs was en route to Offutt AFB carrying a special high-level advisory panel chaired by Lt. General Brent Scowcroft. A source at the Pentagon confi rmed to me that Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld created this panel early in 2001 for the purpose of conducting an end-to-end review of the U.S. nuclear command-and-control system. $\\underline { { 5 3 } }$ This was unprecedented. Although the U.S. military once conducted a more limited fail-safe and risk reduction review (in 1991-93), never before had it undertaken anything so comprehensive as an end-to-end review. My source also identifi ed the members of the panel. Without question, they were among the most senior national security experts in the land: including Maj. General Michael Carns, Dr. John Crawford, William Crowell, John Gordon, and Art Money, who by 9/11 had been replaced by Linton Wells. See my endnote for their impressive resumes.54 Obviously, the offi cial 9/11 investigation should have interviewed all of these panelists about the Global Guardian exercise and the E-4B fl ight over Washington. At the very least, these most senior experts might have shed some light on the “security failures” of 9/11. Of course, this never happened. Shortly after Flight 175 crashed into the South Tower, USSTRATCOM reportedly terminated the 2001 Global Guardian exercise.55 However, the E-4Bs remained aloft.56 In his 2003 book about cyber-terrorism, Black Ice, Dan Verton, a former U.S. Marine Corps intelligence offi cer, writes that at about the time", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:The 9_11 Mystery Plane - Mark H.

No doubt this was Global Guardian. His book states that “they transitioned from exercise status to real-world status in the air.” Was this the plane that later circled over the White House? When I contacted Dan Verton about this, he informed me that he did not know. But I did learn a few additional details. Verton stated that his “longstanding source” is “a former senior military offi cer (with many stars)” who was aboard the E-4B on the morning of 9/11. 58Verton does not know the exact departure time of the E-4B. In an email, however, he identifi ed the airport as Andrews AFB. Later, this same E-4B fl ew to Offutt AFB, where Verton says he reached his informant by telephone, the day after the attack. The author of Black Ice currently writes for Computerworld. In a 9/11 retrospective in the Washington Post, reporter Bob Woodward also mentioned the doomsday plane. Woodward wrote that on September 11, “Pentagon offi cials ordered up the airborne command post [i.e., the E-4B] used only in national emergencies.” 59The context of Woodward’s story implies that the order to launch the E-4B was not given until after the Pentagon strike. This agrees with a September 12, 2001 story in the Dayton Daily News, which reported that shortly after 9:43 A.M., “An E-4B National Airborne Operations Center, a white 747 jumbo jet often confused with Air Force One, took off from Wright-Pat [Wright-Patterson AFB] for an undisclosed location. It returned later in the day. Wright-Pat is one of a few designated alternate bases for the fl ying command center.”60 From the story, it would appear that the E-4B departure from Wright-Pat was the designated alert plane and was sent up to assist NORAD in coordinating the military response to the “terrorist attack.” The story makes no mention of Global Guardian. If these sources are correct, we have accounted for two of the four doomsday planes. Although the 2001 Global Guardian exercise was originally scheduled for October, the date was changed in March 2001 and moved up to September. The reasons for this change have never been disclosed.

Although the 2001 Global Guardian exercise was originally scheduled for October, the date was changed in March 2001 and moved up to September. The reasons for this change have never been disclosed. The timing of the schedule change is also curious, because, according to my Pentagon source, the fi rst meetings of Rumsfeld’s special advisory panel also occurred in March 2001. In previous years the military had always staged Global Guardian in October or November, 61and, sure enough, the year after the 9/11 attack the date reverted back. The 2002 Global Guardian occurred in October, and this has continued to be the case.62 This raises disturbing questions. Why did the U.S. military change the date of Global Guardian in 2001? And why did the world’s most sophisticated electronics warfare plane circle slowly over Washington during the September 11 attack? The cruising speed of the E-4B is 580 mph . Moreover, it normally fulfi lls its command and control mission at an altitude of 35-40,000 feet. Why was it seen “loitering” over Washington while the attack was in progress, essentially buzzing the roof tops? During 2006, in a search for answers, my informant “Pinnacle” fi led a formal Freedom of Information Act request with the Federal Aviation Administration, seeking two types of data: identifi cation data, if any, from transponders, and the images of all radar tracks for Washington between 9:30- 10:00 A.M. on the morning of September 11, 2001. The FAA completely ignored his request for radar images and simply responded that they had “no identifi cation records.” “Pinnacle” promptly fi led an appeal, but as of this writing has received no decision. He also fi led a FOIA request with the Secret Service for all relevant information, including radar data, and received a similar reply. “Pinnacle” was told that the Secret Service has “no records or documents of any kind relating to any aircraft whatsoever fl ying near or circling above the White House on 9/11 in the 9:30-10 A.M. time frame.”63 “Pinnacle” also sent the basic facts covered in this chapter to his co gressman, Rep. Adam Schiff (D-CA), along with a request that Schiff look into the matter. His congressman then made an offi cial inquiry in Washington about “a four-engine white jet” observed and photographed near the White House on 9/11. Eventually, Rep. Schiff received a letter from the U.S. Air Force. It stated, This is in reply to you inquiry on behalf of [redacted] regarding his request for information relating to an unidentifi ed aircraft that may have been in restricted airspace near the White House on September 11, 2001 between the hours of 9:30-10:30 A.M.

Curiously, Rep. Schiff received the above reply as a FAX at 8:12 A.M. on the morning of November 8, 2006, which was literally hours before Donald Rumsfeld resigned as Secretary of Defense. As I’ve noted, the command authority for the E-4B rests with the Joint Chiefs of Staff, so it’s likely that Schiff’s offi cial inquiry was passed up the chain of command for a decision. The timing also suggests that Rumsfeld himself may have personally attended to the matter as one of his fi nal actions as Secretary of Defense. Rumsfeld’s last day on the job was no doubt a busy one as he cleared his desk of unfi nished business. But why would Schiff’s request for information require his personal attention? In any event, it is obvious that the DoD lied to Congressman Schiff. No other conclusion is possible, because the evidence leaves no doubt about the presence and identity of the white plane. The questions I have raised bear repeating: Why did an E-4B circle the White House on September 11? And why did the U.S. military alter the schedule of Global Guardian in 2001, then revert back to the former schedule in 2002? Why the offi cial denials? What are the U.S. Air Force, FAA, and Secret Service keeping from us? 32 In early April 2008, I spoke with General Vaughn on the telephone. He told me that on the morning of 9/11 he had just left a meeting at the Army-Navy Golf and Country Club, located in Arlington near Glebe Road, and was on his way to the Pentagon when he saw the strange plane banking over Georgetown. Vaughn says he watched it circle for about a half minute, but he refused to speculate about its identity. He arrived at the Pen- tagon in time to witness the impact. Vaughn told me that Flight 77 passed directly over the location of the new Air Force monument, just east of the Naval Annex.

USAF Major General Michael Carns was a graduate of the fi rst class of cadets at the U.S. Air Force Academy. He went on to become a pilot and logged 200 combat missions in an F-4E in Southeast Asia. During his long and distinguished career Carns commanded a fi ghter squadron and later a fi ghter wing, served as special assistant to the chief of staff of the Supreme Allied Commander Europe, was operational director of the Rapid Deployment Joint Task Force, commanded the 13th Air Force, and fi nished his career in Washington as Air Force Vice Chief of Staff. Carns is the recipient of the Silver Star and the Distinguished Flying Cross. In 1995, soon after his retirement, Bill Clinton nominated him to become CIA Director. Dr. John Crawford, a physicist, was a vice president and deputy director at the Sandia National Laboratories where he was responsible for all of Sandia’s programs, op- erations, staff and facilities, and reported to the lab’s director. Previously, Crawford was responsible for all nuclear weapons development programs in New Mexico, including the Trident II warhead program, cruise missile warheads, and the stockpile stewardship program. Crawford started at Sandia in 1962, and over the years managed or coordi- nated a wide range of research programs. He also served as a scientifi c advisor during the development of the National Ignition Facility (NIF).

Formerly, Crowell was a Vice President of the Atlantic Aerospace Electronics Corporation. After holding several senior positions at the National Security Agency (NSA), he was named Deputy Direc- tor of the NSA in 1994. He served on President Clinton’s Expert Council (PEO), and has held various leadership roles on numerous defense-related panels involving national security issues and terrorism. General John A. Gordon, a retired four-star general in the U.S. Air Force, was the Department of Energy’s (DoE’s) fi rst Under Secretary for Nuclear Security and Admin- istrator of the National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA), an agency created by Congress in 1999 after allegations of Chinese espionage in the nuclear laboratories. For- merly, Gordon was an Associate Director and later a Deputy Director of the CIA. For several years he served as a special assistant to the president for defense policy and arms control. He has also served as director of operations for the U.S. Space Command. Art L. Money, an engineer, was Assistant Secretary of Defense for Command, Con- trol, Communications and Intelligence (C3I) until April 2001. Prior to his Senate con- fi rmation Money held various high posts in the DoD, including Assistant Secretary of the Air Force. Formerly, he was Vice President and Deputy General Manager at TRW, an aerospace contractor. Money’s background is in avionics and surveillance, including the design and development of airborne surveillance systems for intelligence gathering. Money was not on board the E-4B on 9/11, however. He retired in April 2001, after which, Linton Wells fi lled his position at DoD, and also inherited his seat on the advi- sory panel. A graduate of the Naval Academy, Wells served on a variety of surface ships. Eventu- ally he commanded a destroyer and subsequently a destroyer squadron. He retired as a Captain after a twenty-six year Navy career, only to return to work for the Secretary of Defense as a counter intelligence and networking specialist. A glance at Wells’ resume confi rms his extraordinary range of expertise. He holds BS degrees in physics and ocean- ography, a masters in math, and a doctorate in international relations from Johns Hop- kins.

Although I did receive words of encouragement from some readers, many others were critical. Some of these critics complained about the grainy quality of the still shots. Others doubted their authenticity and insinuated that the photos had been retouched or faked. Still others were willing to concede that the video evidence might be genuine, and did show a U.S. Air Force E-4B. But even these individuals refused to believe that the footage had been fi lmed at the White House on the day of the attack. They argued that it was much more likely the E-4B video was from some other time or place. They had a point, since, with the exception of Linda Brookhart’s photo, there was no visual evidence linking the E-4B to Washington on 9/11. As the evidence accumulated, however, this argument became impossible to sustain. The breakthrough was “Pinnacle’s” June 2007 discovery of the stunning footage in the CNN ImageSource archive. This video was the clincher because it obviously had been fi lmed at the White House on 9/11. At this point there was a subtle shift. Many now agreed that the video footage and grainy photo-grabs might be genuine, and did show the world’s most advanced military aircraft circling over the White House on 9/11. These same individuals, however, summarily dismissed the “conspiratorial” implications. They asked: Why wouldn’t an E-4B fl y over Washington DC during a terrorist attack? One view frequently expressed was that the doomsday plane was merely responding in a time of national crisis. These critics argued that the E-4B probably had been involved in a military exercise at the time of the attack, and was simply diverted — moved into position over the White House to help coordinate the defense of the nation’s capital. Yet, if this were the case, why the denials by the U.S. military? Surely, openly acknowledging whatever positive role the doomsday plane may have played would have demonstrated NORAD’s resilience and its capacity to defend the nation. After the shocking “security failures,” would not this have helped restore the public’s confi dence? Although it is possible that the E-4B’s presence was innocent, given what we now know this seems unlikely, and it becomes more so with every passing day.

On September 12, 2007, the day after the sixth anniversary of the September 11th attack, the Turner network aired a three-minute broadcast about the E-4B fl yover on Anderson Cooper 360^(∘) . The segment had been prepared by John King, and featured portions of CNN’s raw footage, cited in the previous chapter, which had been gathering dust in the CNN archive for six years. This CNN video report is still posted on the Internet and is well recommended to readers.1 Not surprisingly, John King framed the story in the expected manner. It was, of course, taken for granted that the E-4B was on a legitimate mission when it buzzed the White House. All the same, the report was a breakthrough because it confi rmed the basic facts. King based his report on consultations with two government sources who were knowledgeable about the incident. The sources refused to identify the plane, but they did confi rm that it was a military aircraft. CNN was told that “the details are classifi ed.” However, the video evidence captured by CNN’s own reporters was so compelling and so unambiguous that John King had little diffi culty identifying the mysterious white plane as “among the military’s most sensitive aircraft,” namely, an E-4B, the so-called doomsday plane. King also correctly noted that “six years later the Pentagon, the Secret Service and the FAA all say, at least for pubic consumption, they have no explanation of the giant plane that fl ew over the president’s house as the smoke began to rise across the river at the Pentagon.” King’s report on CNN was important because millions of jaded Americans have become totally dependent on the national news media for their information about the world. For them nothing is real unless they see it on television. CNN’s belated coverage fi nally made it possible for these Americans to accept the visual evidence as bona fi de. This was not some bizarre hallucination from the conspiratorial fringe. The fl yover was very strange, yes, but it was no less real. It happened. The real question is why the U.S. Air Force still denies everything in the face of incontrovertible evidence. I give CNN positive marks for airing this important evidence. Even so, John King’s September 12 report on Anderson Cooper 360^(∘) still suffered from the familiar defi ciencies that plague U.S. journalism.

The real question is why the U.S. Air Force still denies everything in the face of incontrovertible evidence. I give CNN positive marks for airing this important evidence. Even so, John King’s September 12 report on Anderson Cooper 360^(∘) still suffered from the familiar defi ciencies that plague U.S. journalism. Today, television programming in our country has slumped to an all-time low. Most programs are little more than “fi ller.” By this I mean, they fi ll the empty space between commercials, which are the true message and what the medium is really about. TV news, meanwhile, has largely become infotainment, geared not to educate and inform the citizenry but to manufacture consent for the offi cial point of view while boosting a network’s ratings. Today’s incarnation of Randolph Hearst’s slanted yellow press of yesteryear specializes in drive-by reporting and the art of the killer sound byte, with a heavy emphasis on the whoopee factor. Spin is everything, content strictly secondary, and in-depth analysis almost nonexistent. Gone are the days when serious muckraking journalism did occasionally happen in our country. CNN’s three-minute report was accurate insofar as it went. Unfortunately, due to its extreme brevity, CNN failed to do justice to one of the outstanding mysteries from September 11. John King neglected to mention a number of crucial facts, and spun the others. In the CNN report John King implies a vague dismissal by the U.S. military when he states, “Ask the Pentagon, and it insists this is not a military plane.” The particulars of the case, however, are a good deal more incriminating. By law, when the U.S. government receives a Freedom of Information Act request, it is not allowed to claim that it has no information simply because something is classifi ed. The 2005 FOIA law explicitly states that in a case involving classifi ed material the government must explain that the records exist, but are exempt. Assuming that CNN’s government sources were correct, and the circumstances surrounding the E-4B fl y over on 9/11 are indeed classifi ed, the Air Force, FAA, and Secret Service were legally obligated to inform “Pinnacle” (who submitted these FOIA requests) of this fact. We are left to wonder why none of them did. See Appendix, page 302, for one offi cial response. Department of Defense regulations are also similar to the FOIA statute. Military regulations stipulate that in cases where information requested by a member of Congress on behalf of a constituent is classifi ed and cannot be released, “the Member requesting the information shall be advised promptly of that fact and of the reasons for the determination.”2Clearly, the U.S. Air Force’s letter of denial to Rep.

Adam Schiff (D-CA) was in violation of military regulations. The matter is more serious yet, because Rep. Schiff has a security clearance to view classifi ed material. As the representative of California’s 29th district, Schiff serves on two House sub-committees that deal with terrorism. 3 Indeed, Schiff himself has played a leading role on the issue by introducing legislation to strengthen security at U.S. facilities stocked with biological weapons. More recently, Schiff also authored a bill that would require air cargo to be screened for explosives. If the E-4B fl y-over on 9/11 was indeed classifi ed, the U.S. Air Force, at a minimum, was obligated to inform the congressman of this fact. Why then, did they lie? Since when do U.S. national security interests require the Pentagon to deceive the nation’s duly-elected representatives? Of course, President Bush bears the ultimate responsibility for such a policy, because the Nightwatch fl eet falls directly under the national command authority, meaning the Secretary of Defense (at the time, Rumsfeld) who reports directly to the president. Furthermore, it is the White House that sets the tone for the government as a whole, including the military. More recently, we witnessed another ugly case when the Bush White House refused to allow Oregon Rep. Peter DeFazio to view the administration’s contingency plans for Continuity of Government. As a member of the Homeland Security Committee in the House, DeFazio has clearance to enter a secure “bubble room” in the Capitol and examine pertinent classifi ed documents. DeFazio was understandably shocked at being denied access. He told Portland’s Oregonian: “I just can’t believe they’re going to deny a member of Congress the right of reviewing how they plan to conduct the government of the United States after a signifi cant terrorist attack.” Then DeFazio added, “Maybe the people who think there’s a conspiracy are right.” 4Both of these cases show the obsessive secrecy of the Bush administration, especially since 9/11. Given that transparency and openness are essential to representative democracy, what else can we conclude but that the U.S. has ceased to function as a republic? If honest answers exist, they might be found in one or more “after action reports” describing the events of 9/11, at least one of which surely includes a discussion of the E-4B incident.

Assuming that military personnel did their duty after 9/11 and fi led such a report(s) through military channels, in all likelihood it (or they) came into the hands of Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld in the hours immediately following the 9/11 attack. There is reason to think that such reports once did exist, because so-called OPREP, or operational reports, are standard procedure in the U.S. military. In fact, they are required by military regulations. Of course, if these reports survived the shredder, today they are probably locked away in a desk or safe somewhere in the Pentagon, far from prying eyes. A 1993 instruction document from the Joint Chiefs of Staff describes in detail the military’s in-house reporting system in effect at the time of the 9/11 attack. 5The reporting system is organized in a hierarchical manner, with lesser incidents requiring reports to lesser commanders. Only the most serious incidents require the highest level or so-called Pinnacle reports (OPREP-3 PINNACLE, abbreviated as OPREP-3P). My anonymous colleague adopted this as his personal screen name. This is not mere coincidence. It so happens that “Pinnacle” has devoted a considerable amount of time and energy investigating the U.S. military’s internal reporting system. The instruction document from the Joint Chiefs clearly states that in the case of a “signifi cant event or incident” involving “national-level interest,” a PINNACLE or highest level report must be fi led with the national command authority, meaning the National Military Command Center, a secure offi ce in the Pentagon which is the nerve center for U.S. nuclear war planning. Incidentally, this is the same offi ce that proved dysfunctional on 9/11. A PINNACLE level report would also make the rounds of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and, as noted, would surely land on the desk of the Secretary of Defense. The instruction document defi nes a “reportable incident” as any event that “generates a high level of military action, causes a national reaction, affects international relationships, causes immediate widespread coverage in news media, is clearly against national interest, or affects current national policy.” Obviously, the events of September 11, 2001 met every one of these criteria and without question would have been reportable. Did the appropriate offi cers fi le such internal reports in the hours after the attack? And, if so, do the reports still exist? The instruction document goes on to describe the different types of operational reports (OPREPs), and the relevant procedures with each. The various sub-categories are identifi ed by different code or fl ag names.

The instruction document goes on to describe the different types of operational reports (OPREPs), and the relevant procedures with each. The various sub-categories are identifi ed by different code or fl ag names. For example, an OPREP-3 PINNACLE NUCFLASH (i.e., OPREP-3PNF) is the code name for any situation that creates a risk of nuclear war, such as an unauthorized nuclear detonation, the accidental or unauthorized launch of a nuclear capable missile or plane, or the detection of an unidentifi ed object by a missile warning system. Another category, OPREP-3P EMPTY QUIVER (OPREP-3PEQ) is the code name for the seizure, theft, or loss of a nuclear weapon. OPREP-3P FRONT BURNER (OPREP-3PFB) is the code name for an attack on or harassment of U.S. military forces, a category under which a summary report about the events of 9/11 might well have fallen. At least one of the category names, OPREP-3P BROKEN ARROW (OPREP-3PBA), has become a part of popular American culture. Broken Arrow is the code name for an incident involving an accidental nuclear detonation, radioactive contamination, or the jettisoning of a nuclear weapon or component. If it sounds familiar, this is because the code name Broken Arrow was leaked, and in 1996 became part of our lexicon when Hollywood produced a high-budget fi lm by that name. The movie starred John Travolta, as a deranged Air Force offi cer who steals two nuclear weapons and proceeds to hold the nation hostage to nuclear blackmail. The screenplay suffers from more than a few corny lines, but the movie made up for it with lots of action, and the story was plausible enough to become a box offi ce success. No one apparently noticed that Hollywood switched code names, preferring the sexier Broken Arrow to Empty Quiver, which, as noted above, is the actual OPREP-3 term for nuclear theft. More recently, the U.S. news media reported a live case. As already mentioned, on August 30, 2007, U.S. Air Force personnel at Minot AFB in North Dakota “mistakenly” loaded six nuclear-armed cruise mis siles under the wings of a B-52 bound for Barksdale AFB in Louisiana — the fi rst reported unauthorized fl ight of nukes over U.S. airspace in nearly 40 years. The incident reached the news media only because USAF airmen leaked the story to the 7The security breach was not discovered until 36 hours later, when a ground crew at Barksdale AFB began removing the missiles. One can imagine the airmen’s surprise on discovering that the missiles were nuclear-armed. At that point, the offi cer on duty alertly notifi ed the National Military Command Center at the Pentagon.

One can imagine the airmen’s surprise on discovering that the missiles were nuclear-armed. At that point, the offi cer on duty alertly notifi ed the National Military Command Center at the Pentagon. According to the Post, within hours an OPREP-3 BENT SPEAR report raced up the chain of command to Secretary of Defense Robert Gates, and reportedly even reached the desk of President Bush. The mishap was serious enough that it prompted the Air Force to order a one-day stand-down of the Air Combat Command so that offi cers could review safety procedures. Yet, within the military’s OPREP-3P reporting system a BENT SPEAR incident is regarded as less serious than a PINNACLE-level event, which surely characterizes the September 11 attack. Assuming that the U.S. military’s internal reporting system functioned after 9/11, in accordance with regulations, this can only mean that at least one PINNACLE report reached Rumsfeld and the White House within hours of the attack. Indeed, given the complexity of events and the multiple “intelligence failures,” in all likelihood there were several Pinnacle level reports, all bearing the same identifi cation number. It also stands to reason that a copy of at least one of these would have been sent to the FAA, since the USAF E-4B violated the FAA prohibited zone, i.e., P-56, not to mention that agency’s obvious role in cases of air emergencies and hijackings. Did the Secret Service also receive a copy? This too seems plausible, because the White House also came under threat of attack on 9/11. It is the Secret Service, after all, not the U.S. military, which is the ultimate authority when it comes to the president’s personal security. This includes the White House grounds and the airspace above the presidential mansion, which the E-4B clearly violated on 9/11. Therefore, it is reasonable to conclude that the Secret Service was also in the loop. But if the FAA and Secret Service received copies of said report, why then do both agencies now claim to have no information, as if the event never happened? Indeed, why is the whole matter surrounded by an aura of mystery and denial? In fact, it is quite likely the USAF offi cer who was piloting the E-4B on 9/11 contacted the Secret Service directly by radio to notify the White House of his imminent approach, so as not to become an accidental victim of the Stinger missiles reportedly deployed on the roof of the president’s house. According to one self-styled Internet expert, the E-4B has no missile defenses. 8 If this source is correct, the Secret Service surely learned — and still knows — the identity", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:The 9_11 Mystery Plane - Mark H.

We can’t be certain, but the facts suggest that the military’s internal reporting system failed to function in the hours and days following the September 11 attack. Although author Dan Verton does not support “conspiracy theories” and attributes the so-called security failures of 9/11 to the fog of war, nonetheless, he evidently agrees with this conclusion. Verton informed me that on September 12, 2001, when he spoke (by telephone) with a high-ranking member of the Scowcroft advisory panel, his informant was then at Offutt AFB and “was still going through the events in question.” Verton writes that his source was extremely displeased with the U.S. military’s feeble response to the 9/11 attack and “mentioned that the after-action report would not refl ect well on their performance” — an obvious allusion to the reporting system I have described. Did one or more OPREP-3P reports materialize after 9/11? Verton mentions such a report in his book,9 but he later informed me that “[I] never saw it…. I have no idea if he [the informant] ever followed through, or if he did, if it was accepted/circulated … the way things work with this administration, I’m sure it was circulated, only in a million thinly shredded strips.” $\\boldsymbol { \\underline { { 1 0 } } } \\mathbf { N N }$ concedes that the video evidence it aired September 12, 2007 on Anderson Cooper 360^(∘) was never-before-shown raw footage from 9/11. However, the network has yet to explain why it “sat” on this important evidence for six years. We know that videos of the E-4B fl y-over were shown in the U.K., in Spain, and probably in many other nations during the world coverage of 9/11. Yet here in America, the same evidence was kept out of the national news media for six years. The question is: Why? The circumstances suggest that this was an orchestrated effort — not accidental or coincidental. During the days, weeks, and months following 9/11, there were many confl icting stories about the trajectory of Flight 77, including reports that the American Airlines fl ight made a pass over Washington and fl ew near the White House before striking the Pentagon. Bob Woodward was responsible for one such report, which appeared in the Washington Post. $\\scriptstyle { \\frac { 1 1 } { ! \\mathrm { I", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:The 9_11 Mystery Plane - Mark H.

Yet, even as these reports gained wide coverage and credence, CNN was in possession of video evidence that would have helped sort out and clarify what really did happen. Why then, did CNN withhold this important evidence from the nation? With hindsight, it would appear that within 24 hours of the attack someone in a high position at CNN made a decision to suppress this information. On September 12, 2001, the day after the attack, CNN posted a minute-by-minute timeline of 9/11. But strangely absent is any mention of the stories fi led by Kate Snow and John King about the mysterious white plane. 14Who made the decision to expunge the E-4B fl y-over from the news? Here, I must emphasize: It is not my intention to single out CNN for special criticism. No doubt other networks were also in possession of similar evidence. Probably, they still are. As this book went to press, we learned of two additional videos of the E-4B fl y-over. Both actually aired on U.S. television, but with no contextual discussion, analysis, or follow-up. One short video was captured by an ABC cameraman as he was leaving the White House grounds. The footage is very similar to the CNN footage in that it shows the evacuation in progress. However, the overhead shot of the plane is very brief. Also, due to the sun’s brightness, the fi lm is overexposed, and the E-4B is only visible with contrast enhancement. ABC actually aired this evacuation segment at 10:42 A.M. on the day of the attack. The reporter mentions hearing a plane overhead, and in the segment White House police can be seen looking up at the sky. However, after 9/11, ABC dropped the issue and there were no follow-up reports.15 The other short video appeared on FOX in 2004. It even mentioned that a doomsday plane fl ew over the White House on 9/11.16 However, there was no discussion by FOX of the above concerns, and nothing about the", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:The 9_11 Mystery Plane - Mark H.

It even mentioned that a doomsday plane fl ew over the White House on 9/11.16 However, there was no discussion by FOX of the above concerns, and nothing about the E-4B’s possible role in the NORAD response. With these latest additions, there are eight known video segments of the E-4B fl y-over. The CNN report on AC360^(∘) also suffered from another fl aw. It neglected to discuss, or even mention, the E-4B’s involvement in USSTRATCOM’s 2001 Global Guardian exercise. One would think that the strange rescheduling of the 2001 drill from October to September, and the subsequent switch back in 2002, would have rated at least a sound byte, especially since the Pentagon gave no explanation about the schedule change. Why did John King not mention this in his report? The matter is important because it is well known that military exercises can provide cover for covert operations. A serious in-depth television report would, at least, have mentioned these facts, thereby focusing a spotlight on the 911 Commission’s failure to investigate them. Surely the function of the media is (or ought to be) to expose incompetence and malfeasance in high places. The Pentagon’s rescheduling of Global Guardian was noteworthy in light of the 9/11 attack, and should have been thoroughly investigated by the 9/11 Commission. It wasn’t. The commissioners failed to go there. Unfortunately, so did CNN, which thereby fumbled a chance to serve the national interest. CNN’s absent-minded coverage served only to perpetuate the offi cial omission. CNN also missed another opportunity. John King failed to interview Brent Scowcroft or any of the members of Rumsfeld’s special advisory panel. If Verton’s account is correct, all of them were aboard the E-4B during its fl yover. Their identities were not classifi ed information. I was able to learn their names simply by making a phone call to the Pentagon. (Imagine my surprise when a real person picked up and volunteered the details.) The CNN network has far more resources than I do, and certainly could have done this much, at the very least. No doubt, the panelists have quite a story to tell about what they saw that day. The fact that their story has never been told has to be one of the more puzzling aspects of the U.S. media’s collective amnesia about 9/11.

Given the cloak of secrecy surrounding the event, what else are we to think? The evidence suggests, and I believe we must conclude, that the decision to suppress the story came from above, and refl ected the perceived narrow interests of the media’s corporate ownership. Regrettably, those interests appear to be in sharp confl ict with the best interests of our nation, and by this I mean the greater good. One of the high points of the CNN report was a brief interview with Lee Hamilton, co-chair of the 911 Commission, who stated that he had “a vague recollection” of the 9/11 mystery plane. He claimed that his staffers had looked into the incident but never raised it as a relevant issue. Said Hamilton, “This never rose to the level of a discussion within the commission.” His statement was important and called for further clarifi cation. For example, who made the policy decision? One of the staffers? If so, which one? Surely the individual has a name. Another question: Was Hamilton in the loop? Unfortunately, we have no answers because CNN failed to follow through. Whoever conducted the interview apparently forgot the essentials of journalism, i.e., the who, what, where and when. Nonetheless, the circumstantial evidence strongly points to Philip Zelikow, Executive Director of the commission. Yeah. A lot of things that came to the attention of staff did not come to the attention of the commission. Some of the things did come to the attention of the commission, and we didn’t put ’em in, or at least we put ’em in at a lower level. But many of the things did not come directly to my attention [my emphasis].17 This is a remarkable admission, because, as co-chair of the commission, it was Hamilton’s job to keep the investigation on track by providing sage leadership and guidance. Certainly this included the responsibility for supervising the staff and maintaining a fi rm grip on the agenda.

Hamilton has called the “conspiracy theories” ludicrous, but what is truly ludicrous is the idea that the E-4B fl y-over on 9/11 was not important enough to rise to the level of a discussion. Obviously, the E-4B crew, especially the pilot, not to mention the members of the advisory panel who may have been on board, were important ancillary witnesses to the events at the Pentagon. The E-4B pilot, for example, had he been interviewed, might have provided the commission with an eyewitness account at least as important as the testimony of Lt. Col. Steve O’Brien, the C-130H pilot who was interviewed and whose story, as we know, became a part of the offi cial record.19 The E-4B’s radar and other electronic data was also important evidence, and should have been subpoenaed and carefully studied by experts appointed by the commission. But, of course, none of this happened. In fact, Hamilton’s remarks on CNN and his 2006 statement on CBC News demonstrated such blatant incompetence as to thoroughly discredit the offi cial 911 investigation and its fi nal report, which makes no mention of the E-4B, not even in a footnote. Indeed, I would argue that the raw footage aired by CNN on September 12, 2007 is suffi cient grounds, in and of itself, for throwing out the 9/11 Commission Report entirely and reopening the investigation. By the way, Hamilton’s grudging admission that commissioners were denied access to key information has been corroborated by at least one other member of the panel. Max Cleland, former U.S. Senator from Georgia, served on the 9/11 Commission for approximately one year, and during a November 2003 interview with Salon.com, shortly before resigning, he complained that as a panelist he did not have full access to all of the pertinent documents. Cleland compared the 9/11 investigation to the failed Warren Commission, and made it clear to Salon.com that he preferred to resign rather than participate in a coverup .20 Exactly. No one has put it more succinctly.

David Ray Griffi n offers a more nuanced perspective in his latest book, which includes a chapter about the E-4B incident.22 Griffi n prefaces his remarks by stressing a point I have already made, but one that bears repeating. According to the offi cial timeline, the U.S. military did not learn about the approach of Flight 77 until 9:36 A.M. (that time again!), barely two minutes before the Pentagon strike. Griffi n writes, This short warning period … gave the Pentagon time only to order an unarmed C-130H cargo plane, which was already in the air, to identify the approaching aircraft as a Boeing 757 before it crashed into the Pentagon. As we know, the C-130H pilot, acting on orders, proceeded to shadow the alleged Flight 77 as it made its fi nal approach. Yet, according to the offi cial story, it was already too late. Given this short warning time, the U.S. military was unable to mount a defense. The E-4B’s presence, however, constitutes a serious problem for this now-standard version of events. As I’ve already noted, Dan Verton’s, and at least two other accounts, place the E-4B in the skies over Washington before the Pentagon strike, which, if true, punches a hole in the offi cial story large enough to accommodate a Boeing 757 — or some other large aircraft. As we know, Flight 77(?) approached from the west and executed a 330-degree looping turn over Alexandria, Virginia, before making its fi nal approach, a downward spiral that took just over 3 minutes. Griffi n writes, … a military plane over Washington [i.e., the E-4B] would have been in position to observe this maneuver after having seen Flight 77’s approach to Washington. The 9/11 Commission’s claim that the military had only ‘one or two minutes’ notice’ of an approaching aircraft would become implausible. Griffi n is correct. As I have emphasized, this was no ordinary plane. The E-4B undoubtedly has advanced radar, in addition to state-of-the- art communications equipment, everything needed to electronically observe the approach of Flight 77(?) from many miles away. The cockpit of the E-4B was also an ideal perch from which to establish visual contact with Flight 77(?) long before its arrival. If the E-4B was in the Washington DC area, it was in excellent position and could have alerted the Pentagon and/or mustered whatever defenses were available, such as ground-to-air missiles. The airborne command and control plane was also well-placed to help direct the F-16 fi ghters from Langley when they arrived on the scene shortly before 10 A.M.

Let us not forget, at this point the “terrorist” attack was still in progress. Hijacked Flight 93 was still over Pennsylvania and was believed to be heading toward Washington. As Secret Service Deputy Director Barbara Riggs has made perfectly clear, staffers at FAA headquarters still believed the White House was in grave danger. Dan Verton writes in Black Ice that soon after the fl ying command post took off from Andrews AFB it “converted literally on the fl y from exercise status to real world status.”23 This would indicate that the doomsday plane was available to assist in the NORAD response. Verton also mentions that the E-4B arrived at Offutt AFB later in the day. However, Verton offers no further details in his book about whatever role the E-4B may have played. As noted, reporter Bob Woodward also mentioned the E-4B in his 2002 retrospective series in the Washington Post, writing, “Pentagon offi cials ordered up the airborne command post [i.e., the E-4B] used only in national emergencies. 𝔰24 Woodward likewise offered no further clues. It is not even clear from his article which E-4B he was referring to. Was it the Wright-Pat departure? Woodward probably did not know himself, and simply repeated whatever his sources at the White House told him. Nonetheless, his article does give the strong impression that the command post was sent up for the purpose of assisting the military’s response to the 9/11 attack. While we have no information about the role played by the E-4B that departed Wright-Pat AFB after 9:43 A.M., one thing is certain: The E -4B that buzzed the White House played no role whatsoever. Far from helping to coordinate the defense of the nation’s capital, it appears that the E-4B pilot did not even wait around for the Langley fi ghters to arrive, but simply left the scene. In her book, Touching History, a 2008 account of the intense drama that unfolded in the skies over America on 9/11, Lynn Spencer mentions that the NEADS commander was unable to communicate with the Air National Guard and Langley pilots after they established a defensive combat air patrol over the nation’s capital. $\\underline { { 2 5 } }$ The reason?

Due to the distance and the curvature of the earth, the radio signals from NEADS (located in Rome, NY) were not receivable in the DC area below 20,000 feet. The communication problems only added to the confusion. The matter was resolved, later that morning, when an E-3 AWACS arrived and began to serve as a high altitude communications hub. Gen. Larry Arnold stated that this particular AWACS plane just happened to be in the vicinity on “a training mission.” 26According to another source, it was in the skies over Pennsylvania.27 But Arnold and the Air Force have yet to explain why the world’s premier electronics platform, which was already on the scene, failed to assist in the defense of Washington. Insofar as I am aware, there is no evidence that the E-4B was even in radio contact with any of the fi ghter pilots before, during, or after their delayed arrival, with the possible exception of one mysterious radio transmission that has never been explained. As reported by the BBC, Langley fi ghter pilot Major Dean Eckmann overheard a transmission at 9:33 A.M. while piloting his F-16 over the Atlantic. In Eckmann’s own words: “They said, ‘All aeroplanes, if you come within 30 miles of Washington DC, you will be shot down.’”28 Who gave this order, and why? Did it come from the E-4B pilot? Was he warning off all planes, military as well as commercial, for the purpose of concealing his presence over the capital? In truth, we do not know. Yet, it is strange that the BBC story is nowhere mentioned in the 9/11 Commission Report. If the E-4B was on a legitimate mission, then how do we explain its odd behavior? There is also the matter of its low pass over the White House. As I have noted, the E-4B command-and-control plane is designed to fl y at high altitude. Insofar as we know, the E-4B has no offensive weapons, and therefore had no reason to fl y low over Washington. In fact, given that the “terrorist attack” was still in progress, the pilot’s low fl ight path over the White House placed the E-4B in jeopardy. After all, there was no telling what might ensue. Anything was possible, including nuclear terrorism aimed at the Capitol or White House. For all of these reasons a bona fi de command-and-control plane would have gone out of its way to avoid downtown Washington. The E-4B’s low pass over the White House also exposed the plane to accidental attack by the Secret Service, which is known to possess Stinger missiles.

The E-4B’s low pass over the White House also exposed the plane to accidental attack by the Secret Service, which is known to possess Stinger missiles. According to one source, already noted, the E-4B has no defense against ground-to-air missiles. But even if this report is incorrect, why take a chance? Either way, the E-4B’s fl ight path is improbable, and hard to explain, unless, of course, the E-4B pilot had reason to be confi dent that his plane was not in danger. So, we see, the presence of the E-4B before the Pentagon strike and its strange behavior, taken together, deal a possibly fatal blow to debunkers of “conspiracy theories,” who appear to have snared themselves in their own logic. All of this establishes a clear motive and might explain why Executive Director Phil Zelikow could decide to suppress all information concerning the incident, just as he likely did in the case of Able Danger (as we will learn in a later discussion). From the standpoint of shoring up the offi cial narrative, it was crucial that the potentially incriminating details about the E-4B never reach the eyes and ears of the commission members, at least not in any sensible form, lest the panelists decide on their own initiative to undertake a genuine investigation of the incident. From the standpoint of the offi cial story, this would have been a disaster — the equivalent of opening Pandora’s box — for once begun, an honest inquiry might have led even the most purblind commissioners to stumble forward, in the direction of still more undesirable facts and ultimately to the troubling questions — and perhaps even some of the conclusions that I have already presented in this book. Did Zelikow take precautionary measures to insure this would not happen? Concealing the E-4B from the commissioners would have been easily done, since, as we know, Zelikow personally controlled the commission’s agenda and the fl ow of information to the various panel members. As we are about to discover, however, the cover-up did not start with Zelikow. 2 The DoD regulation in question is 5400.4. The verbatim wording is as follows: “4.3.

It may still be viewed at http:// archives.cnn.com/2001/U.S./09/16/inv.hijack.warning/. Our nation’s capital is especially beautiful in the springtime when the cherry blossoms are at their peak. I say this from experience, having spent my youth in the DC area. Moreover, part of my family still lives in northern Virginia. So, it happened that I returned there in early April 2008 to complete the research for this book. My trip came about in the following way: In February 2008 I received an email from Rebecca McNerney, a well known analyst at the Department of Energy (DoE), who contacted me after reading my article on the Internet about “The 9/11 Mystery Plane.” It seems that McNerney was an eyewitness on September 11, 2001. At the time, her offi ce was located in the DoE building (sixth fl oor) at 950 L’Enfant Plaza, in SW Washington DC. In her email McNerney wrote: “Approximately 5-10 minutes after the Pentagon incident I saw a large white plane fl ying rather low from the White House over the National Mall toward the Capitol.”1 After some correspondence back and forth, McNerney agreed to meet with me in Washington for an interview, on site. Naturally, I was pleased for the opportunity to “see” what she saw on 9/11, throughher eyes. On September 11, 2001, McNerney, like millions of other Americans, was starting her work day when she learned about a tragedy unfolding in New York City. Someone two doors down had a TV on, and the people in her department gathered around watching in horror as the North Tower burned. Then came the second strike. When McNerney learned that the Pentagon was also under attack she hurried down the hall to her boss’s offi ce on the west end of the DoE, which has an unobstructed view across the Potomac. By this time a column of heavy smoke was billowing skyward. McNerney says she watched for a few minutes, in shock, then returned to her own offi ce, located on the north side of the DoE. Moments later, she observed the large white plane cruising eastward toward the Capitol. McNerney is convinced it was the same plane described in my article. She says she was terrifi ed", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:The 9_11 Mystery Plane - Mark H.

Moments later, she observed the large white plane cruising eastward toward the Capitol. McNerney is convinced it was the same plane described in my article. She says she was terrifi ed when she saw it. The strange white plane was low in the sky, obviously, where no commercial aircraft should ever be. She thought it was a suicide attack aimed at the Capitol. There was also the unsettling possibility that the DoE might be next. Seconds after it appeared, the white plane passed out of sight behind a nearby building. McNerney mentioned the strange aircraft to her colleagues but none of them had seen it. They thought she “was seeing things.” Soon after, the order came to evacuate. The next hour was gridlock, as thousands of government employees simultaneously left Washington. McNerney says that during the long ride home she kept searching the skies, but she never again saw the white plane. In fact, over the next six years she never heard or read anything more about it, until she stumbled upon my article on the Internet. We met at L’Enfant Plaza on April 4, 2008, and McNerney graciously walked me through her 9/11 experience. Although her department has since been relocated to a different building, she made prior arrangements for us to revisit her former offi ce. I had assumed, wrongly, that the DoE was several miles from the Pentagon. Not so. The distance from L’Enfant Plaza is no more than about a mile. Her boss’ former offi ce on the sixth fl oor is spacious and commands a stunning vista across the river. The entire Pentagon looms large in the window. McNerney’s own former offi ce has a more limited view-shed to the north, due to the proximity of other buildings in the sprawling government complex at L’Enfant Plaza. The E-4B was very low in the sky when she saw it, possibly as low as 500 feet. This is consistent with the videos of the E-4B captured from Lafayette Park. It would appear that the doomsday plane was losing altitude as it completed its loop over the White House. At that point, it probably swung east toward the Capitol. If this is correct, the time of day can have been no later than 9:41 A.M., when ABC’s Peter Jennings reported the sighting at the White House.2 But the fl y-over must have happened before this, because one would expect a time lag of at least one or two minutes.

The 9:41 A.M. time is not guess work. Fortunately, as I have noted, someone at ABC had the presence of mind to embed a screen clock during the network’s live coverage of September 11. This was not a video timer but a real-time digital clock set to Eastern Daylight Savings Time. From the standpoint of 9/11 truth, this clock was a lucky break because it provides us with an invaluable time-stamped record of that morning’s horrifi c events from 8:51 A.M. (EDT), when ABC started its coverage, until about 9:54 A.M., when for some reason the clock was removed. Moreover, this entire record was later archived. So, it is easily accessible for study on the Internet. As I already noted, Jennings reported the plane circling the White House before he made his fi rst comments about the Pentagon strike. For whatever reason, the time lag was longer with regard to the events across the river. As the reader may by now have observed, Rebecca McNerney’s testimony that she observed the white plane 5-10 minutes after the Pentagon strike is not a close fi t with the offi cial Pentagon crash time of 9:38 A.M. Therefore, her account must be added to the large body of other evidence which, taken together, calls into question the circumstances of the Pentagon strike.3 I have come to view this as the most complex set of unresolved issues associated with 9/11. As such, it it is beyond the scope of this book and needs to be addressed and resolved by a new and fully empowered 9/11 investigation. Another goal of my trip was to identify the exact location where Linda Brookhart captured that stunning picture on the cover of this book. The search proved easier than expected, thanks to the building’s distinctive architecture. I found the place after only a short stroll through the streets west of the White House. Brookhart was standing near the corner of 18th Street and Pennsylvania Avenue when she snapped the photo. She was facing east-south-east at the time, and was just outside the World Bank. The spot is only one short block west-northwest of the White House. From where Brookhart stood you can actually see a part of the roof-line of the Old Executive Offi ce Building. This fi x on the location allows us to place the doomsday plane in the sky with considerable precision. No mistake, when Brookhart took the picture, the E-4B was almost exactly above the White House and was on a northeasterly heading.

I documented the position with photos of the building and the street sign on the corner. As we proceed, this exact placement of the E-4B will turn out to be extremely important. In October 2007, the cause of 9/11 truth received a major boost when the U.S. Air Force released its radar data from September 11, 2001. This was in response to a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request fi led by an independent 9/11 investigator named John Farmer. 4 (He is not the same John Farmer who served on the 9/11 Commission.) This other Farmer is a semiretired process-control engineer who also had a 12 year career in law enforcement. The radar data covers all four fl ights. The data stream starts at 5:30 A.M. EDT and extends to almost the entire day of September 11, 2001. The data fi les were packed onto four CDs and include Excel spreadsheets, powerpoint diagrams showing the various fl ight paths, and replay programs produced from the raw data.5 (Special software is needed, however, to play them.) A cover letter explains that all of this material was compiled on September 13, 2001 by the U.S. Air Force’s 84th Radar Evaluation Squadron (RADES), based at Hill Air Force Base in Utah, at the request of the FBI. John Farmer has since made this data freely available to other 9/11 investigators.6 The RADES radar data, as it has come to be known, is comprised of surveillance data from long-range radar facilities operated by NORAD and the FAA. However, it does not include returns from the FAA’s more accurate shortrange radars located at the major airports, including Andrews, Reagan and Dulles in the Washington DC area. Short-range radar is more accurate, because it scans every 4.5 seconds, as opposed to every 12 seconds in the case of longrange radar. Because I am primarily interested in the fl ight of the E-4B, I will limit this discussion to the radar coverage for Washington. Fortunately, a 9/11 researcher named Marco Bollettino created a helpful animation from the RADES radar data, which is readily accessible on the Internet.7 Bollettino used Camstasia software to record the screen while the RADES software video program was playing.

If we are careful we can authenticate it ourselves even as we study it. The radar animation picks up the action at 9:29 A.M. as Flight 77(?) approaches from the west. It covers the Pentagon strike and the subsequent arrival of the Langley fi ghters. Readers are encouraged to watch the animation before reading the rest of this chapter (see endnote 7). Those who do will have no diffi culty following my discussion. However, for convenience, I have also included diagrams that display the same information in a composite form. As we are about to learn, the RADES radar data is important not only for what it reveals, but also because of what it fails to show. Before we begin, however, I need to inform the reader about a little-known 9/11 anomaly. For reasons that have never been disclosed, the RADES 9/11 radar data from NORAD’s Northeast Air Defense Sector (i.e., NEADS) was time-lagged by 25.3 seconds. An offi cial document indicates that the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) knew about the time lag by February 2002, if not sooner, and according to the same document, the lag was exclusive to the northeast sector. 10 The radar data from other NORAD sectors was unaffected and was in agreement, as usual, with Global Positioning Satellite (GPS) time. John Farmer was able to independently confi rm this while studying the RADES radar data. In it he discovered a few data sets from NORAD’s Southeast Air Defense Sector (SEADS), data that was not timelagged.11 Offi cial documents obtained by Farmer through a separate FOIA release indicate that the 9/11 Commission also knew about the unusual 25.3 second delay,12 however, neither the commission nor the NTSB offered any explanation for it. In its study, the NTSB simply corrects the RADES data by adding 25.3 seconds, and insofar as I am aware, the 9/11 Commission fails even to mention the issue in its fi nal report. As we know, the U.S. military was in the midst of numerous war games on September 11, and Farmer has suggested there may be a connection. “It seems reasonable,”", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:The 9_11 Mystery Plane - Mark H.

As we know, the U.S. military was in the midst of numerous war games on September 11, and Farmer has suggested there may be a connection. “It seems reasonable,” he speculates on his blog, “that as part of those exercises the radar data was being processed through some synthesizer which permitted the injection of ‘false’ exercise targets.” 13Although the time-lag issue has received scant attention, it could turn out to be one of the most important 9/11 anomalies. By the end of this discussion the reasons will be self-evident. Let us start with the following graphic, which displays the composite radar track of the approaching AA Flight 77(?), including its descending 330-degree loop over Alexandria. Notice, the same composite image also shows the track of the C-130H transport, also a part of the offi cial narrative, identifi ed in the animation by its call sign as GOPHER06. The C-130H pilot, Lt. Col. Steve O’Brien, had just taken off from nearby Andrews AFB and was en route to his home base in Minnesota.14 By chance, his departure at 9:32 A.M. coincided with the high-speed approach of an unidentifi ed aircraft from the west. O’Brien was in excellent position to observe the attack upon the Pentagon, and, no doubt, for this reason he was instructed by air traffi c controllers at Reagan Airport to shadow the incoming aircraft. This he proceeded to do. O’Brien made an abrupt turn to the northeast and briefl y tailed the plane — until the crash. Notice, the graphic shows his sudden course change. A number of eyewitnesses also reported seeing the C-130H fl ying behind and above the fi nal approach of whatever hit the Pentagon.15 Lt. Col. O’Brien apparently fl ew over the Pentagon himself, observed the plume of smoke and fl ames, then swung around and was ordered to vacate the area. After which, he resumed his fl ight to Minnesota. His story includes one of the oddities of 9/11, because O’Brien also happened to be in the vicinity of Shanksville, Pennsylvania when Flight 93 went down shortly after 10 A.M. According to the RADES radar data, there were only two other signifi cant departures from Andrews AFB on 9/11 during the relevant time frame. The fi rst plane, to be discussed later in this chapter, lifted off at 9:26 A.M., just as the national Ground Stop was going into effect. The other left Andrews at 9:43:57 A.M. (which I will round it off to 9:44 A.M.).

(which I will round it off to 9:44 A.M.). The next diagram shows part of the composite fl ight path of this second plane, which has never been identifi ed. Notice, its 9:44 A.M. departure time was nearly 18 minutes after the national Ground Stop at 9:26 A.M. We must ask, Why was this other plane allowed to leave Andrews in the fi rst place? In fact, the same question can be raised about the C-130H, whose 9:32 A.M. departure was about six minutes after the Ground Stop. Readers who study the animation will notice that this plane is designated as M3_0310. Here, M3 is the standard Mode 3 transponder setting for both military and civilian aircraft. In fact, we know this was a military plane because it was also transmitting an M2 code (not mentioned in the animation), a military code not used by civilian aircraft. The diagram shows that after leaving Andrews at 9:44 A.M., the plane circled over Washington, then left the area on a southerly heading. At 9:50 A.M., as the plane continued south, three fi ghters from Langley AFB approached from the east (not shown in the fi rst diagram). The F-16s were apparently tracking this plane, because they closed rapidly and overtook it about forty miles south of Washington. The preceding graphic images display the fl ight paths of the Langley fi ghters and this other plane. John Farmer generated both images from the RADES radar data. The next diagram has been around for years, having been widely reported in the U.S. media coverage of 9/11. Notice, it shows the departure of the F-16s from Langley AFB, the initial wild-goose chase out over the Atlantic, the second wild-goose chase northwest toward Baltimore, and, fi nally, this loop south of Washington. But the media diagram gives no information about the 9:44 A.M. departure from Andrews, and there is nothing about the intercept. Although the diagram shows the roundabout detour south of the capital, this was not explained in the national news media at the time. The detour was never a part of the offi cial story. Certainly the U.S. military never mentioned it. Nor does the 9/11 Commission in its 2004 fi nal report. The question we should be asking is: Why not? The commission surely knew about this intercept south of Washington. After all, the offi cial investigation had the 84th RADES radar data in its possession.16 While correlating the radar data with the 9/11 NORAD tapes, John Farmer discovered another part of the story.

He found that NEADS did not actually order the fi ghter pilots to intercept the plane, but simply instructed them to fl y to a point on the map, a so-called “CAP point.” As it happened, the fi ghters intercepted the plane from Andrews en route. (See endnote for the exact coordinates.)17 If you listen closely to the audio you can actually hear this rendezvous information being transmitted by radio. The NEADS order, the The detour is important because it delayed the arrival of the Langley fi ghters over Washington by 5-10 crucial minutes. Could this be why the Pentagon never informed us about this part of the story? No doubt this also explains why the 9/11 Commission perpetuated this cover-up in their fi nal report, which makes no mention of the detour. However, we still do not know the details. Was the commission as a whole responsible for the cover-up? Perhaps. Then again, it may have been engineered by Phil Zelikow, who as we know had operational control over the agenda and the fl ow of information to the commissioners. Did Zelikow withhold the vital RADES radar data from the members of the offi cial panel? This certainly is a promising area for further research. So we see the importance of the RADES radar data released in October 2007, six years after 9/11. The radar data fi nally serves to clarify and correct this part of the offi cial record. Even so, the full story about why the Langley fi ghters were deployed south of Washington has never been told. It is extremely important that we learn the truth, because, recall, when Michael Bronner interviewed NEADS Commander Kevin Nasypany for his September 2006 Vanity Fair article, Nasypany disagreed with the commission’s fi nal report. He told Bronner, “I knew where Flight 93 was. I don’t care what [the 9/11 commission says]. I mean, I care but I made that assessment to put my fi ghters over Washington. Ninety-three was on its way in [to Washington] …”18 In short, Major Nazypany continued to insist that the commission was wrong, and that the Pentagon’s earlier version of events had been correct all along!

Because if Major Nasypany did know about Flight 93 and sent his fi ghters to Washington, how then do we explain this 40 mile detour south of the city which served only to cause further delay?

Why does it matter? Because if Major Nasypany did know about Flight 93 and sent his fi ghters to Washington, how then do we explain this 40 mile detour south of the city which served only to cause further delay? It was another wildgoose chase, and — notice — that makes three in a row. Given that Flight 93 was over Pennsylvania at the time, i.e., in the north, why were the F-16s from Langley sent in the opposite direction? The failure of the 9/11 Commission to explain this key part of the story — allow me to repeat: it is nowhere mentioned in their fi nal report — raises grave questions that can no longer be denied. The fl ight of this second plane out of Andrews and the CAP point rendezvous certainly appear to have been scripted. Was all of this a part of some pre-planned war-game scenario? Was NEADS in the midst of an exercise even as the attack was in progress? Was the 9:44 A.M. Andrews departure a pre-arranged decoy sent to hold up the military response? The detour accomplished nothing except to delay the Langley fi ghters. Was this the intent? To summarize, was the detour south of DC a diversion, ordered for the purpose of allowing Flight 93 suffi cient time to complete its suicide mission upon the nation’s capital? I am well aware of the serious nature of these questions. I would argue, however, that they are now unavoidable, given that the 9/11 Commission Report covered up this important evidence. Of course, as we know, the likely fi nal phase of the 9/11 “terrorist attack” never materialized, possibly because Flight 93’s departure from Newark Airport was much delayed due to heavy runway traffi c. Originally scheduled to depart at 8:01 A.M., Flight 93 did not fi nally get off until 8:42 A.M. — forty minutes late. Did this delay create insuperable problems for the conspirators? And were some of these conspirators also infl uenced by the fog of war? Did someone fail to receive word of a highlevel clandestine decision to abort (in the case of Flight 93) until too late? Assuming treason, at some point a contingency plan would probably have kicked in. Was an order given at the last minute to shoot down Flight 93 to destroy evidence and silence potential witnesses? Unfortunately, these are the kinds of disturbing questions we must ask in light of the RADES radar data.

In June 2008, just before this book went to press, and after I had already written the above analysis, a new book about 9/11 appeared with the fi rst published disclosure about the detour south of Washington. The book is Lynn Spencer’s Touching History — already briefl y mentioned in chapter one. Ms. Spencer is an excellent writer, and the fact that she also happens to be a commercial pilot was a huge asset in researching her account of the failed NORAD response on 9/11. Her gripping narrative captures the intensity of the moment, including the shock and full range of emotions experienced by the I contacted the author because I was interested to know if she talked with Laura Brown, the FAA offi cial who in 2003, as I noted in chapter one, informed the 9/11 Commission that the FAA set up phone bridges to the Department of Defense shortly after the fi rst WTC impact. The Brown memo fl atly contradicts the offi cial story that the U.S. military was out of the loop. It was read into the record, but never appeared in the 9/11 Commission Report. Fortunately, I did reach Spencer and exchanged several cordial emails, that is, until cognitive dissonance set in. Ultimately, I learned more about her from this short dialogue than from her book. The author informed me that she did not interview Brown. In her email Spencer also volunteered the following editorial commentary: “It seems that two years after the fact, she [Brown] remembered the bits and pieces but not in a cohesive way. Sometimes in such circumstances, they blend (like Mineta’s inadventant [sic] comments regarding AAL 77 - he was actually referring to UAL 93).”19 In short, Spencer discounted the testimony of Brown and also Mineta because, in her view, their memories from 9/11 were unreliable due to the passage of time. It is well known that memory gradually fades. Eyewitnesses also tend to to embellish or exaggerate their experience of a past event, and there is no reason to think this general phenomenon would not be true in the case of 9/11. I have a serious problem, however, with Spencer’s peremptory dismissal of Laura Brown’s testimony, because, in my opinion, that refl ects a rather dogmatic point of view. This is partly because Spencer admits that she never interviewed Brown, but also because (as the author informed me) she conducted her own interviews in", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:The 9_11 Mystery Plane - Mark H.

In fact, Spencer herself exaggerates the passage of time in the cases of Brown and Mineta, who actually gave their testimony in May 2003, i.e., less than two years after 9/11. As I read Touching History, it became apparent that Spencer did not have access to the RADES radar data. This is unfortunate, because radar is a powerful tool — it could have been used as a “fact check” to confi rm the testimony of her witnesses. Radar is, after all, an equal opportunity employer. It has no agenda and does not discriminate. It simply is what it is: an unbiased empirical record. Well, what does the radar show? Assuming that the author reported accurately, the radar data shows that her own witnesses were not immune to the passage of time. The radar confi rms that at least some of them embellished and/or confused the facts — the very thing for which Spencer cites Brown and Mineta. From the 9/11 radar data, it is possible to calculate the fl ight speed of the NORAD fi ghters, and when John Farmer did just that, he found that the Langley F-16s averaged about 630 mph (550 knots) en route to Washington — not 700 mph as Spencer states in her book (p. 182). While the difference is not huge, the data nonetheless shows the tendency to embellish. The speed crept higher with the passage of time. In another case, Spencer writes (p. 43) that one of the Otis pilots broke the sound barrier as he passed 18,000 feet, shortly after leaving Otis AFB. But the radar data indicates this happened later, after the fi ghters left the holding pen south of Long Island. Another case of fuzzy memory. Incidentally, from the radar data, it is by no means certain the pilot did break the sound barrier. It was close. If he did it was only for a brief moment.21 Unfortunately, we cannot know how many other similar cases mar Spencer’s narrative account.

Radar will take us only so far, and due to the paucity of reference notes in Touching History, there is no way to independently check the author’s sources. We are left to ponder how different Spencer’s narrative might have been, had the author applied the same standard to all witnesses. If anything, the testimony of Laura Brown and Norman Mineta, recorded less than two years after 9/11, is arguably more credible than the interviews Spencer collected fi ve years down the road. Supposedly, the miscue occurred at 9:40 A.M. According to Spencer, Citino later discovered his error, relayed the correct information, and at 9:51 A.M. “the threeship [i.e., the formation of three Langley fi ghters] instantly turned toward the new coordinates [i.e., Washington].” 22Spencer’s timeline, however, is refuted by the RADES radar data (see the fl ight path diagram) which clearly shows that at 9:40 A.M. the Langley fi ghters were still in Whiskey 386, the holding pen off the Virginia coast. At this point they had only just begun the second wild-goose chase, toward Baltimore. At 9:51 a.m. the fi ghters began to swerve, yes, but not in the direction of the capital. At 9:51 the F-16s were only starting, not ending, their third and fi nal wild-goose chase, away from Washington. As indicated by the diagram, the Langley pilots did not fi nally get on the right track to the nation’s capital until after 9:55 a.m. To be sure, the NEADS radar was time-lagged by 25.3 seconds, but even taking this into account, Spencer’s timeline is still way off. One of the weaknesses of Touching History is the absence of any critical analysis. Spencer never broaches the obvious question: Just how believable is it that NEADS could miss a city like Washington (on the third try) by at least forty miles? If there was a mistake, why was it not discovered and corrected much sooner? Surely NEADS was tracking the fi ghters on radar, and it must have been obvious that they were moving away from Washington. In the audio we can hear the NEADS radio crew speaking (channel 2), and at no point is there is any talk about a mix-up. Nor is anything said about a course correction. After failing to ask the obvious, Spencer proceeds to confi rm our worst fears with her blasé assertion that the detour of the Langley fi ghters south of Washington was of no great signifi cance.

She writes: “In retrospect, neither their airspeed nor their routing would have made a difference in their getting to Washington before American [Flight] 77.”23 Yes, true enough. But Spencer conspicuously fails to mention Flight 93, which, as noted, was still in the air. The last time I looked at a map, Pennsylvania was north of Washington— not south. When I queried Spencer about the 9:44 A.M. Andrews departure, the author had no information. She mentioned that the fl ights out of Andrews AFB were beyond the scope of her research. Still, she offered an opinion: “I believe that the A/C [i.e., aircraft] that you are referring to were part of the COG [Continuity of Government] plan. This is a highly classifi ed plan and not relevant to my book.”24 I then showed Spencer the radar-generated diagram of the 9:44 A.M. departure circling over Washington, and posed this question: Is it reasonable that a COG plane, possibly loaded with high government offi cials, would have circled over the capital in the midst of a terrorist attack? The answer, of course, is an emphatic “No.” The pilot would have peeled away from downtown Washington immediately after taking off from Andrews. Spencer apparently assumed that I was referring to the E-4B that fl ew over the White House. Perhaps she had seen one of my articles on the Internet about the white plane. Conceding my point about COG, she wrote back that she was not surprised … that an airborne command and control plane was circling over the city. If I wanted to feed radar and radio data to the White House PEOC [i.e., the underground bunker below the west wing] - information that it did not otherwise have - that is exactly what I might do. But given that I am not privy to this classifi ed information, I do not know what their mission was. I clearly do not have the curiosity or concern about it that you do.25 Although I restrained myself upon hearing this, I wanted to fi re back: “Oh, really? Is that why they erased the E-4B from radar?” But, now, I am getting ahead of my story. Once upon a time, in my younger days, I shared Lynn Spencer’s implicit trust in the benevolence of the U.S. government.

Assuming a defi nitive account of 9/11 is one day written, it will not solely be based on some NORAD tapes and the fading memories of government eyewitnesses. It will be augmented with offi cial FAA, Pentagon, and Secret Service documents, fl ight logs, air traffi c control tapes, the RADES radar data, the short range radar, in short, with the whole panoply of physical and documentary evidence from which histories are normally constructed. $\\underline { { 2 6 } } \\mathrm { I n }$ fact, this is the very evidence that the 9/11 truth movement has been struggling for years to pry loose from a stonewalling government. If the U.S. military wanted the truth to be told, then, why did they not simply hand over all of this material in the fi rst place? Was Spencer “blessed” like Michael Bronner and Bob Woodward with unique access to midwife a limited disclosure, not for truth-telling, but to shore up the offi cial version of reality? From numerous passages in Touching History it is clear that Spencer is a fi rm believer in the “war on terror.” No wonder Generals Eberhart, Myers and Arnold enthusiastically endorse her book. So ended my short dialogue with Lynn Spencer. However, we not quite fi nished with the 9:44 A.M. Andrews departure, which — I repeat — has never been identifi ed. Consider the following image of this plane’s extended fl ight path, also generated from the RADES radar data. Notice that after the intercept, the plane fl ew south and made a series of loops, which might signify a refueling rendezvous with a tanker. Then, the plane charted a bee-line across Virginia, West Virginia and Ohio. The radar track ends at 11:55 A.M. someplace over Indiana. However, by extrapolating we can determine the plane’s likely destination.

In her email, Lynn Spencer guessed that this unknown departure from Andrews at 9:44 A.M. was the E-4B. She is not alone. Others have drawn the same conclusion.27 This deserves careful consideration because the plane’s probable destination is consistent with Dan Verton’s account. In a way, its time of departure also suggests that it might have been an E-4B.

This is possible. As I showed in chapter two, we have only accounted for two of the four E-4Bs in the Nightwatch fl eet. I should mention: There was yet another strange report on 9/11 about a large white plane over Martha’s Vineyard. I learned about this from Colin Scoggins, who says the mysterious plane buzzed the local FAA tower soon after 10 A.M., and was suffi ciently threatening that FAA offi cials ordered an emergency evacuation. Scoggins thinks it might have been a KC-10 from McGuire AFB in New Jersey. But no one knows for sure. The low-fl ying white plane was never identifi ed. $\\underline { { 2 9 } } \\mathrm { { H o w } }$ many doomsday planes were in the sky over the eastern United States on September 11? This question will redound through the remainder of this discussion. If an E-4B left Andrews at 9:44 A.M., obviously, this cannot have been the same E-4B that buzzed the White House, because the time of departure is three minutes after the live report by Peter Jennings at 9:41 A.M. When Jennings was airing the live story about a mysterious plane over the White House, this other plane was still on the tarmac at Andrews. Moreover, the positional data is also wrong. A careful examination of its fl ight path over Washington confi rms that although this other plane fl ew in the general vicinity, it never approached closer than about a mile of the presidential mansion, and this is a conservative estimate.

Nor is there any chance of signifi cant error regarding its position because, according to the U.S. Air Force, the RADES radar data should be accurate to within an eighth of a nautical mile. 30Its departure time and fl ight path are simply incompatible with the confi rmed sighting of an E-4B over the White House at, or before, 9:41 A.M. It was only thanks to a lucky break that we learned about the earlier (i.e., 9:26 A.M.) departure from Andrews AFB. John Farmer had entirely overlooked this fl ight because for some reason the plane was not transmitting a military code, which is very unusual. (Its civilian code was M3_0512.) As Farmer put it: “Due to the clutter from Reagan, I fi ltered Andrews traffi c by valid M2V bit (all military planes have this set to 1). M3_0512 has this set to 0, [which would indicate] a civilian plane. So it was lost in the Reagan NAP [i.e., National Air Port] clutter.”31 Fortunately, on June 11, 2008, “Pinnacle” received a batch of 9/11 documents from the FAA in response to a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request. The documents were from Reagan NAP and one of them indicated that a Boeing 747-200, code-named Sword31, was released to take off from Andrews AFB at 9:23 A.M. According to the documents, this other plane was also bound for Offutt AFB. (See Appendix, pages 303-306, for the FAA documents.) When Farmer went back and rechecked the radar data, he found that the FOIA’d documents were correct. This departure from Andrews fi rst appears on radar at 9:26 A.M. The fi rst graphic shows the plane’s fl ight path over Washington. The second shows the plane’s extended radar track. Notice, it fl ew just north of the radar gap on the West Virginia-Ohio border. After making two course changes, it then also headed for Offutt AFB. ^(32^(′)) This 9:26 A.M. fl ight was probably the E-4B mentioned by Dan Verton in Black Ice. The time of departure is a reasonable fi t with Verton’s account. Recall, Verton claimed that a USAF doomsday plane left Andrews AFB at about the time the FAA was shutting down the airspace over New York City.33 It would appear that the plane actually left Andrews just as the FAA shutdown was going national.

One thing is certain: This was not the E -4B that buzzed the White House. As its radar track clearly shows, it never fl ew near the presidential mansion. This can only mean that there were at least two E -4Bs in the skies over Washington on 9/11. There may have been three. The 9/11 Commission could have untangled this mystery, if the panel had been serious about providing “the fullest possible account of the events surrounding 9/11.”34 All of the information concerning the Andrews departures was pertinent to the offi cial investigation, including the fl ight logs, the audiotapes of radio communications with air traffi c controllers, as well as the shortrange radar data. The commission should have subpoenaed and reviewed all of this evidence. As we know, of course, nothing of the sort happened. This completes our review of the signifi cant departures from Andrews AFB during the relevant time frame. Notice, we have exhausted the possible candidates (two in number) by a process of elimination. Although one of these departures was probably a doomsday plane — and both may have been — neither was the E-4B that fl ew over the White House. We are left with an unsolved mystery. Today, the physical presence of an E-4B over the White House on September 11, 2001 is beyond dispute. We have the videos, the Brookhart photo, the press and eyewitness accounts. On this basis, therefore, should we not expect that the plane was detected by radar? Yes, of course! This goes without saying. Yet, incredibly, there is no hint in the RADES radar data that a plane fl ew anywhere near the White House. Where the radar track of the E-4B ought to be, there is nothing. So, how did a 230-foot Boeing 747 with a wingspan of 195 feet vanish into thin air? If we were talking about a stealth bomber, we might expect something like this. But a four-engined Boeing 747? Impossible! The conversation proved helpful. Richardson informed me that before 9/11, the FAA’s short-range radar was used strictly for air traffi c control at the various airports — it was not used for military surveillance, hence, was not plugged in to the NORAD system. This might explain why the FAA and Secret Service could track a plane locally without the U.S. military being in the loop. Of course, this does not explain why the 9/11 Commission failed to subpoena and study the FAA’s short-range radar data. I also learned more about the variables that affect radar coverage.

Of course, this does not explain why the 9/11 Commission failed to subpoena and study the FAA’s short-range radar data. I also learned more about the variables that affect radar coverage. These include the curvature of the earth, the proximity of the site, the height of the tower and also its elevation above sea level. Local topographic features, i.e., hills and ridges, or even tall buildings, are also a factor, because these can cause interference. Richardson suggested that any of the above might explain why the E-4B failed to show up on radar on 9/11 — assuming it was present. When I mentioned the eyewitness accounts and video evidence indicating that the plane fl ew as low as about 500 feet, this suggested to Richardson that the E-4B might well have dipped beneath radar. I was not surprised to hear this. I already knew about one such case, and it bore out the principle. While investigating the Pentagon strike, John Farmer discovered that a security camera on the nearby Doubletree Hotel recorded the fl y-by of a military helicopter at an estimated altitude of about 300 feet. Yet, this same fl y-by escaped radar detection. The RADES radar data confi rms that the helicopter left Andrews AFB at 9:13 A.M., fl ew west in the direction of the Pentagon, but disappeared over the tidal basin just west of the Potomac River36 . Did something similar happen at the White House? Did an E -4B fl y under radar? I was open to this possibility. However, the more I studied it, the more the evidence failed to support it. Former air traffi c controller Robin Hordon was already convinced from the RADES animation that NORAD/FAA radar was “seeing” the take-offs at Andrews AFB down to as low as 200 feet. 37Surely the “low fl oor” at Andrews would also hold true at the White House, which shares similar topography. This part of Washington is about as topographically challenging as a pancake. Nor does the subdued DC skyline in the vicinity of the White House present any serious obstacles to radar. Downtown Washington’s relatively low skyline is the result of building codes designed to enhance rather than compete with government monuments and buildings, including the president’s house. The situation is different at the Pentagon, which lies at the base of a signifi cant hill. This might explain why a helicopter was invisible to radar at 300 feet. One of the variables affecting radar coverage is the curvature of the earth, which, fortunately, can be calculated with considerable precision. When John Farmer crunched the numbers, he found that Hordon was right. The nearest NORAD long-range radar", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:The 9_11 Mystery Plane - Mark H.

One of the variables affecting radar coverage is the curvature of the earth, which, fortunately, can be calculated with considerable precision. When John Farmer crunched the numbers, he found that Hordon was right. The nearest NORAD long-range radar facility to Washington is located at Plains, Virginia. The Plains tower is about 1,000 feet above sea level and is situated approximately 12 nautical miles west of Dulles International Airport and about 39 nautical miles from Andrews AFB. When Farmer did the calculation based on these numbers, he found that the curvature of the earth in no way impedes this tower’s radar coverage of Washington. The relevant data are displayed in the following graph. Notice that the curvature of the earth only begins to effect radar coverage from the Plains tower (in a southeasterly direction) at a distance of about 50 nautical miles. Washington is well within this range. Farmer concluded, “I see nothing in the data that would limit acquiring a return for an aircraft above 200-250 feet in the Andrews or White House area. ^(, 938) (Needless to say, the graph would look very different if the calculation had been done in a westerly direction, due to the nearby Appalachian mountains.) At this point, there was a new and surprising development. I received an email from Jeff Richardson at 84th RADES. Apparently my earlier call had piqued his curiosity. Richardson wrote to inform me that his point of view had changed as a result of studying the RADES radar data. He had gone back for another look and now agreed with Hordon and Farmer! Richardson wrote, “There are beacon mode C returns in the DC area, some below 500 feet, that would indicate the Plains radar had some low altitude coverage. If there was an E-4B in the area at 09:41 [A.M.], I can not explain why it was not in the recorded radar data.”39 Evidently, after our phone conversation Richardson also explored some of the material on the Internet about the mystery plane, i.e., the E-4B fl y-over. His email continued: “The few accounts I looked at seemed to show the aircraft in question much higher than 500 ft., and I would think more radars than just the Plains [tower] would have detected it.” Readers who study the RADES animation will observe return clusters, i.e., multiple radar blips, for some of the aircraft, indicating returns from the three separate radar sites covering the area.

The Plains radar facility isone of these. A second tower is located at Oceana, Virginia, not far from Langley AFB. A third is at Gibbsboro, New Jersey. The Plains facility, however, is by far the closest of the three to the Washington area, and for this reason it gives the most accurate returns. I was amazed and gratifi ed by this development. It is extraordinary because it means we now have consensus on this issue — something I never dreamed would happen. The U.S. Air Force’s 84th Radar Evaluation Squadron (RADES) now agrees with 9/11 investigators that the doomsday plane’s loop over the White House should have been detected by NORAD/FAA long-range radar. Yet, it was not. So, how is this mystery to be explained? This is the question, and in the face of continuing denials by Pentagon offi cials I believe we must consider all possibilities, including the “unthinkable.” Was radar data intentionally withheld or scrubbed? This appears to be the case. But why would the U.S. Air Force go to the trouble of concealing a command-and-control plane? Surely this suggests that the E-4B was not on some innocent mission. Such a conclusion is further supported by the evidence presented in the previous chapters. A covert operation would certainly explain the breakdown in the Pentagon’s operational reporting (OPREP) system. In an email, Lynn Spencer complained to me that “the system did not work,” but this truism fails to explain 9/11. The military’s internal reporting system is not limited to “after action” reports, which I discussed in the previous chapter. A product of the Cold War, the OPREP system was intended to streamline the military response in the event of a nuclear attack, or threat of an attack, and surely the 9/11 “attack” would have been treated in a similar manner. The reporting system is capable of responding within minutes, not days or hours. Military regulations and the chain of command are clearly defi ned, and all roads lead to the offi ce of the Secretary of Defense. This includes the National Military Command Center (NMCC), the nerve center of the Pentagon. Even as his command staff tried in vain to contact him, Rumsfeld walked out of the building to assist with the wounded on the lawn near the heliport. Here was a powerful clue. Although much has been made of the president’s odd behavior on September 11, Rumsfeld’s was no less strange. The only thing more bizarre is that the U.S. media did not even seem to notice.

The only thing more bizarre is that the U.S. media did not even seem to notice. Assuming a covert operation, only a few individuals in the U.S. military would have been privy to the true nature of the E-4B fl ight. Everyone else, both military and civilian alike, would have assumed without hesitation that the doomsday plane was simply responding to the “terrorist attack.” True enough, its fl ight over the White House presented problems for the FAA and Secret Service, but neither of these agencies are subject to military regulations. Rumsfeld was the command authority, and in subsequent days he might easily have squelched any protests from this direction. A covert mission might also explain the scheduled departure of a second E-4B from Andrews AFB just minutes before the “attack.” This second E-4B was probably involved in Global Guardian, as reported. Yet, it might also unwittingly have provided cover for a clandestine operation. Witnesses on the ground would tend to confuse and merge the two fl ights. We are extremely fortunate to have the CNN footage and the amazing photo by Linda Brookhart, both of which make it possible to pinpoint the E-4B’s precise location. We are also extremely fortunate that someone at ABC posted a screen clock during the network’s coverage. The question “how did they do it?” is an intriguing one. Did the U.S. military exploit some new technological breakthrough on 9/11 that is being kept from us? I was reminded of the fi rst use of stealth technology in combat during operation Desert Storm, when the Pentagon unveiled an entire fl eet of fi ghter-bombers invisible to radar. The stealthy planes played a key role during the “shock and awe” phase of that war. Yet, prior to it, the government had successfully kept this radical new technology secret for years. I would agree that such a possibility seems far-fetched in the case of 9/11. However, we need to explore every avenue. I am not the fi rst to suggest that radar data was scrubbed by military hackers. If John Farmer is correct that the U.S. military may have utilized a 25.3 second break in the radar data stream to insert phony radar tracks during one of the exercises underway on 9/11, the delay might also just as easily have been used to erase other signals. According to former air traffi c controller Robin Hordon, a 25.3 second time lag would allow more than enough time for a clandestine hacker to alter or erase a radar signal.41 As noted, the time lag has never been explained.

If the E-4B’s radar track was being scrubbed as the “attack” was in progress, this can only mean that the E-4B cover-up was not hastily improvised later for the purpose of “covering tail,” i.e., hiding someone’s incompetence. No, it was pre-planned, hence, by defi nition, was part of a conspiracy. We must be cautious, however. John Farmer informs me that the time lag could also be the result of computer processing, done sometime later. We simply do not know. But either way, the scrubbing of the E-4B’s radar track, whether during the “attack” or after, amounts to the destruction of evidence, an extremely serious matter. And let us not forget Flight 11. Recall, NEADS radar technicians had the precise coordinates, yet failed to locate the plane. So, here is another possible example of scrubbing. But what about the 25.3 second time lag itself? Might the time lag alone explain why NEADS technicians were unable to locate Flight 11? If the radar at Boston Center was on real time and the NEADS radar was lagged, even precise coordinates would have amounted to incorrect information. A Boeing 767 moving at 600 mph can cover a lot of distance — more than 4 miles — in 25.3 seconds. However, when I consulted former air traffi c controller Robin Hordon about this, he discounted the possibility. Hordon says the NEADS radar techs are good, and would easily have overcome a 25.3 second difference. He thinks the radar signal from Flight 11 was erased.42 Let us also remember that the much-maligned 2002 National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) fl ight path analysis of Flight 77 was built upon the RADES radar data.43 This should make us wary of simplistic “fl y-over” theories that could be distracting us from more important questions. But I will not speculate further about the E-4B’s possible role. This is a question for a new 9/11 investigation. I believe that I have presented more than enough evidence to warrant such an inquiry. John Farmer, who favors no particular theory about 9/11, has also found solid evidence that radar data may have been altered in the case of the Pentagon strike. Although most of his RADES radar research is quite technical and beyond the scope of this book, it is easily accessible on the Internet, and is well recommended to curious readers who are willing and able.44 At my request, Farmer drafted a somewhat-less-technical", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:The 9_11 Mystery Plane - Mark H.

Although most of his RADES radar research is quite technical and beyond the scope of this book, it is easily accessible on the Internet, and is well recommended to curious readers who are willing and able.44 At my request, Farmer drafted a somewhat-less-technical paper summarizing his twoyear investigation of the Pentagon event. (It is attached as an Afterword to this book.) He presents both physical evidence and eyewitness testimony that a second plane was in the vicinity at the time of the Pentagon strike. He thinks this other plane may have shadowed whatever struck the building. Farmer’s paper is relevant to this discussion, because there is no hint in the RADES radar data that a second plane was in the area. As of July 2008, 9/11 truth activists were still awaiting the release of the FAA’s 9/11 short-range radar, fl ight logs and various other offi cial documents, under the Freedom of Information Act. All of this material, especially the shortrange radar data, now looms large in light of the above discussion. “Pinnacle” fi led one such request as early as 2006, and he thinks the release of additional records could be imminent. Recently, he learned from a source in the FAA that the agency has made a decision to release all of its 9/11-related data. “Now we will see,” “Pinnacle” wrote in an email, “if the Freedom of Information Act is worth the paper it’s written on.” Other cases are also in the works. John Farmer has several pending FOIA appeals/requests. When I spoke with Jeff Richardson at 84th RADES, he dashed cold water on such hopes. He mentioned that the FAA normally does not save short-range radar tapes. According to Richardson, the tapes are normally reused, which, of course, erases them in the process. 45I was shocked to hear this, since there was nothing normal about 9/11. Surely we are on fi rm ground to expect that after the “worst terrorist attack” in U.S. history the FAA would have saved all of the evidence, including its short-range radar data. Note: On July 25, 2008, “Pinnacle” received a CD from the FAA loaded with yet another batch of FOIA’d 9/11 documents. The CD included fl ight progress strips (see Appendix, pages 307-310), which are used by air traffi c controllers because they provide a handy summary of information about incoming fl ights and departures. FAA controllers typically update the strips in longhand. One strip indicates that on the morning of 9/11 a Boeing 747-200 arrived at Andrews at 7:28 a.m. (11:28 universal time). Its call sign was Word31. (Strangely, a different FAA document refers to this same aircraft as Sword31. Evidently the", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:The 9_11 Mystery Plane - Mark H.

FAA controllers typically update the strips in longhand. One strip indicates that on the morning of 9/11 a Boeing 747-200 arrived at Andrews at 7:28 a.m. (11:28 universal time). Its call sign was Word31. (Strangely, a different FAA document refers to this same aircraft as Sword31. Evidently the call sign was changed.) A later entry confi rms what we already knew: This same aircraft departed Andrews at 9:25 a.m. (13:25 universal time) bound for Offutt AFB. The jackpot, however, was the presence of the telltale acronym, NAOC, indicating that this aircraft was an E−4B . NEACP” [Knee-cap] aircraft, confi rming that this too was an E-4B. Recall, NEACP was the previous designation for the Nightwatch fl eet. Curiously, the audio includes a 9:40 a.m. call from the Andrews fl ight manager informing air traffi c controllers in the tower that the doomsday plane was headed for Offutt AFB and “is not going to wait,” a possible reference to the national Ground Stop, which by then was in effect. Evidently, the E-4B pilot was under orders to get aloft, regardless. In short, the newly released FAA records confi rm that two doomsday planes took off from Andrews on 9/11. As we have already seen, both of these scheduled E-4B departures show up in the RADES long-range radar, however, neither of them fl ew over the White House. The third E-4B, the one that did, remains a mystery. The fi rst CD also contained another hugely important release: the shortrange radar returns from Reagan NAP and Andrews AFB — exactly what 9/11 investigators had been hoping for! A preliminary analysis indicates that, as expected, the newly released short-range radar data was in real time, i.e. was not time-lagged. As this manuscript was headed out the door to the printer, John Farmer, Robin Hordon and Dennis Cimino, another 9/11 investigator, had begun a collaborative effort to analyze this new data, and were busily plotting it alongside, and comparing it with, the RADES radar data: searching in the vicinity of the White House for a radar track of the mystery plane … Stay tuned. This story is far from over. 3 Insofar as I know, a senior military affairs journalist with the U.S. Navy by the name of Barbara Honegger was the fi rst to compile this evidence.

Gallop’s wrist watch at shortly after 9:30 A.M. Notice, it is much easier to account for a clock that stopped after the offi cial time of impact, than before it. One wall clock was in the heliport offi ce just outside the Pentagon. The Smithsonian Institution preserved a photo of this frozen clock, which may be viewed at http://americanhistory.si.edu/september11/collection/record.asp?ID=19. Notice, this photographic evidence was preserved by two unimpeachable sources. From what I understand, the former was on display in the Smithsonian until recently. One website states, “The airplane actually struck the Pentagon at 9:38 A.M.; apparently the clock was six minutes slow.” Yet, both clocks stopped within a minute of the same time. Were they both running 5-6 minutes slow? This is doubtful because, remember, these were military clocks. Anyone familiar with the U.S. military knows they do not run 5-6 minutes behind schedule. Being “on time” is an important part of military discipline. Indeed, it is one of the fi rst lessons that grunts learn in boot camp. Judging from the photos, it appears that one of the clocks was battery-powered, a common type. The other may have been battery-powered, or was an electric wall clock. Both obviously stopped after a powerful shock wave knocked them off the wall. Shattered glass is even visible in one of the photos. In her paper Honegger mentions another famous historical event that was similarly frozen in time: the great San Francisco earthquake of 1906. In the aftermath of “the big one” the San Francisco Chronicle featured a front-page photo of a charred clock that stopped at precisely 5:12 A.M., marking the fateful moment when the massive quake rocked the city. She writes, “… a century after that devastating event the stopped clock serves as both the ultimate evidence and the symbol that captures it all.” Honegger makes an astute point. Will the Pentagon clocks one day be viewed in a similar way? There is other physical evidence, as well. The so-called “Naudet brothers video” includes a segment fi lmed inside a New York City fi re station. In the moment when the fi rst announcement about the Pentagon strike comes over the radio, a wall clock is plainly visible in the background. It reads 9:30 A.M., which, notice, closely matches April Gallop’s frozen wrist watch. Another important piece of evidence is the original Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) “timeline document” from September 11, 2001. It was made public on September 17, 2001, one day before the Pentagon announced the offi cial crash time of 9:38 A.M.

It was made public on September 17, 2001, one day before the Pentagon announced the offi cial crash time of 9:38 A.M. The FAA document states that Flight 77 hit the Pentagon at 9:32 A.M., which is very close to the average of the two frozen clocks. The FAA’s original timeline, however, soon disappeared down a collective memory hole and was forgot- ten. Fortunately, the document can still be viewed at the National Security Archive, a website maintained by George Washington University. Here is a link: http://www.gwu. edu/~nsarchiv/NSAEBB/NSAEBB165/index.htm. Honegger also cites the testimony of a notable eyewitness: the soon-to-be Danish Foreign Minister, Per Stig Moller, who was in Washington on the day of the attack. When he heard a loud noise, Moller looked out the window, saw smoke rising from the Pentagon, and immediately checked his watch. The time was 9:32 A.M., a time that Moller subsequently reported in press interviews on his return to Denmark. Honegger also cites the case of Alberto Gonzales, who was President Bush’s legal counsel on 9/11. On August 27, 2002 Gonzales gave an address at the Naval Postgraduate School in which he stated unequivocally that “the Pentagon was attacked at 9:32 A.M.” Honegger, who works at the school, was present and cites the audio-tape recording of the address by the university. Gonzales’ remark has long since been forgotten, but it shows that even within the Bush administration the offi cial timeline did not take hold for many months. I should mention that Honegger thinks the initial blast wave was probably caused by planted bombs. In her paper she cites a videotaped testimonial of April Gallop taken under oath that the explosion happened literally the moment Gallop turned on her com- puter. Gallop worked in the most damaged part of the Pentagon. Honegger disputes the view that the frozen clocks recorded the moment of impact, although she doesn’t rule out the possibility of a subsequent strike by a missile or a smaller plane, in the same part of the building. Although I disagree with Honegger about this, and suspect that the frozen clocks are the signature of an impact, I also feel that our best chance of resolving these issues and learning the truth is by means of a new investigation fully empowered with the authority to subpoena evidence. According to John Farmer, the offi cial Pentagon crash time is an average. In an email on May 11, 2008 he wrote, “There are two security video systems that recorded the event time at the Pentagon.

The fi rst is the Citgo station video and from it the best estimate for impact event is 09:40:37 – 09:40:38 (video time). The other would be the Doubletree north side camera, which records the fi reball emerging at 09:34:11 (video time). The average of these two times gives 09:37:24. So as you can see, video recording systems time frames tend to vary a great deal. “The offi cial time of impact is given by the NTSB as 09:37:44. That time corre sponds to the CSV fi le released by the NTSB which has had its time scale adjusted by the NTSB (refer to their release documents). However, the data stream stopped prematurely by all indications at around 6 seconds prior to impact, which means by their reckoning true impact time had to be 09:37:50. Using the NEADS time scale, impact time would have been at 09:37:27 and using SEADS time, 09:37:52. “Another time source is the NORAD audio tapes, and the time (as can be seen in Marco’s video) tends to agree with an impact time of between 09:37 – 09:38. I’ve measured the audio time variation in those tapes (using position markers) and during that time frame the time seems to be slow by around 16 seconds. So the empirical time sources discussed so far seem to indicate an impact time between 09:37- 09:38, but closer to 09:38. “Another less known empirical source is the Arlington County EMS tapes. Those are not available for distribution, but can be listened to by prior arrangement. Those I have spoken with who have listened to those tapes indicate agreement with the sources I’ve already discussed. Of course the FBI has custody of the 911 call center tapes and will not release those to the public, invoking law enforcement privilege.” 8 From what I understand, the U.S. military has since released another batch of NORAD tapes. The new batch reportedly totals about 120 hours of material. However, as of this writing I have not been able to locate and download this material for study. Presumably the channel 2 NEADS tape is a part of it. Farmer explained how the audio was synchronized with the animation: “At the beginning of the audio tapes there is a tone at given time intervals.

I wrote a program that reads those markers for each of the audios for my own use (on AAL77. COM for download). There is some variability in the timeline and at 2 hours the MCC audio loses around 16 seconds. So there is a potential 16 second time error in the audio, and a known 25.3 second error in the RADES time, but the synch should be good to + /− a minute at worst case (most likely less than that).” Email from John Farmer, July 15, 2008. $\\underline { { 2 8 } } _ { \\mathrm { ~ I ~ } }$ should mention here that when John Farmer examined the radar data to fact-check the Wright-Pat departure, he found that there were two departures from the base, one (M3_3462) at 9:30 A.M., the other (M3_6745; M2 = 4311) at 10 A.M. Notice, neither of these times is a close match with the departure time reported in the Dayton daily newspaper. The track of the fi rst plane goes west. The track of the second goes southeast and shows that the plane fl ew in a holding pattern over the border between West Virginia and Virginia until mid-afternoon. The plane then returns to base after being replaced by another aircraft (M3_3162). Farmer speculates that this second departure was a tanker, as it fl ew in sync with another plane (from Langley AFB). Moreover, its holding pattern was in an area of frequent tanker activity. Farmer urges caution, however, in interpret- ing the radar data. He writes, “The radar coverage is limited … and would catch it if it went north, east or west. Going directly south, depending on how fast it gained altitude, it could have been out of radar range by the time it reached operating altitude.” Emails from John Farmer, May 17, 2008. 44 In addition to other research, Farmer has been correlating the RADES radar data with the NORAD tapes. Although the project is not done yet, it appears he has already made an important discovery. On one of the tapes Farmer found what may have been the call made by Colin Scoggins at 9:24 A.M. to NEADS that apparently gave rise to the phantom plane story. The transcript reads as follows: “13:24:02 Scoggins, Boston Military calls ID2. ‘We did hear from Washington, there is an aircraft, they", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:The 9_11 Mystery Plane - Mark H.

EDT. When Farmer checked the RADES radar data for this moment in time he discovered that incoming Flight 77(?) was exactly southwest of Washington. Obviously, the FAA had been tracking Flight 77(?), not some phantom plane southwest of New York. Since the 9/11 Commission had this same tape and surely reviewed it, the claim in their report (p. 26) that “We have been unable to identify the source of this mistaken FAA information” stretches the limits of credulity. So we see that Farmer’s discovery provides additional strong support for Norman Mineta’s version of events in the White House bunker on 9/11. Email from John Farmer, April 22, 2008. Check out Farmer’s blog at http://911fi les.info/blog/. His RADES research is posted at http://911fi les.info/blog/? cat=4. As a result of the evidence presented in the previous chapters, I believe we must now broach the question more directly: Was 9/11 an inside job? Regrettably, there is considerable evidence that elements of the Bush administration were complicit in the 9/11 attack, and may even have helped stage it. Let us now examine some of what I regard as the most compelling evidence. However, the following discussion makes no claim to be comprehensive. We know that within minutes of the “worst terrorist attack” in U.S. history, even before the collapse of WTC-2 at 9:59 A.M., U.S. offi cials knew the names of several of the alleged hijackers. CBS reported that a fl ight attendant on AA Flight 11, Amy Sweeney, had the presence of mind to call her offi ce and reveal the seat numbers of the hijackers who had seized the plane. 1FBI Director Robert Mueller later said, “This was the fi rst piece of hard evidence.”2 In his memoirs CIA Director George Tenet emphasizes the importance of the passenger manifests, as does counterterrorism czar Richard A. Clarke.3 All of which is very strange because the manifests later released by the airlines do not include the names of any of the alleged hijackers. Nor has this discrepancy ever been explained. According to MSNBC, the plan to invade Afghanistan and “remove al Qaeda from the face of he earth” was already sitting on G.W. Bush’s desk on the morning of 9/11 awaiting his signature.4 The plan, in the form of a", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:The 9_11 Mystery Plane - Mark H.

According to MSNBC, the plan to invade Afghanistan and “remove al Qaeda from the face of he earth” was already sitting on G.W. Bush’s desk on the morning of 9/11 awaiting his signature.4 The plan, in the form of a presidential directive, had been developed by the CIA and according to Richard Clarke called for “arming the Northern Alliance … to go on the offensive against the Taliban [and] pressing the CIA to … go after bin Laden and the al Qaeda leadership.”5 A former Pakistani diplomat, Niaz Naik, tells virtually the same story. During a BBC interview, three days after 9/11, Niak claimed that senior American offi cials had informed him in mid-July 2001 that the U.S. would attack the Taliban “before the snows start falling in Afghanistan, by the middle of October at the latest.”6 Niak said he received this information in Berlin at a UN-sponsored international contact group on Afghanistan. He also predicted, correctly, that the U.S. attack would be launched from bases in Uzbekistan and Tajikistan. But how could U.S. offi cials know in mid-July that American forces would invade Afghanistan in October unless they had foreknowledge of the attack? Foreknowledge probably also explains why General Richard Myers, the acting Chairman of the Joint Chiefs on 9/11, announced at the fi rst post-9/11 meeting of Bush’s National Security Council, held via video-conference the afternoon of the attack, that “there are forty-two major Taliban bombing targets.” 7But how did Myers come to have such detailed information about military targets in Afghanistan so soon after the 9/11 attack? This important detail belies oft-repeated claims that the U.S. military was not prepared to attack Afghanistan, and points to extensive war planning before 9/11. Journalist Steve Coll arrived at a similar conclusion while researching his 2004 book, Ghost Wars, an excellent history of the period leading up to the 9/11 attack. Coll interviewed two Clinton administration offi cials who informed him that ”the Pentagon had been studying possible targets in the same spring [1998] that the CIA had been drawing up its secret plan to raid Tarnack Farm,” located near Kandahar, Afghanistan, where bin Laden had taken up quarters at the invitation of Taliban leader Mullah Omar.8 According to Clarke, at the same meeting on the afternoon of 9/11, CIA Director George Tenet informed the president that “al Qaeda had committed these atrocities.” 9But, again, how did Tenet know this so soon after the attack, especially given that “security failures” had occurred, unless he had foreknowledge? On September 20, 2001, the Bush administration offi cially declared that Osama bin Laden was responsible for the 9/11 attack.

On September 20, 2001, the Bush administration offi cially declared that Osama bin Laden was responsible for the 9/11 attack. Three days later, Secretary of State Colin Powell announced on Meet the Press that the government would soon release “a white paper” detailing the evidence against bin Laden. Later the same day, Bush faced questions from the press about Powell’s remark and backed away from releasing any additional information.10 Bush explained that the government had a lot of evidence but that most of it was classifi ed and could not be made public. Bush emphasized, however, that the evidence “leads to one person, as well as one global terrorist organization.”11 National Security Adviser Condoleezza Rice made a similar statement during an interview on FOX News. Said Rice, “We have very good evidence of links between Osama bin Laden, al Qaeda operatives, and what happened on September 11.”12 Rice refused to release any particulars, however, and, like Bush, claimed that the evidence was “classifi ed.” As we know, the U.S. government never got around to releasing the promised white paper. Why not? Was it because the evidence was nonexistent? Or perhaps too weak to hold up in court? This was the view of journalist Seymour Hersh, who cited CIA and Justice Department sources to this effect in his regular column in the New Yorker magazine.13 Foreign intelligence agencies were also busily investigating the case, but fared no better. For instance, Germany’s Chief Federal Prosecutor, Kay Nehm, admitted that there was no hard evidence linking bin Laden with the crime.14 The lack of evidence prompted former German Chancellor Helmut Schmidt to speak out against President Bush’s decision to invoke Article V of the NATO Treaty, mobilizing NATO’s involvement in the war on terrorism. In Schmidt’s own words: “Proof had to be delivered that the September 11 terror attack came from abroad. [Yet,] that proof still has not been provided.”15 Osama did not cooperate by acknowledging his role in the attack — on the contrary. In a statement on September 16, 2001 carried by Arabic television service Al Jazeera, bin Laden categorically denied any involvement. Days later, he repeated this denial during an interview with the Pakistani newspaper Ummaut.16 On November 3, 2001 Al-Jazeera released a third statement, in which bin Laden not only denied involvement but also accused the Bush administration of waging a “crusader war” against the Muslim world. To the best of my knowledge, none of these denials were reported in the U.S. media. Why not?

To the best of my knowledge, none of these denials were reported in the U.S. media. Why not? On October 1, 2001, British Prime Minister Tony Blair told the House of Commons that the case against bin Laden was proved beyond a shadow of doubt. Said Blair, “I have seen absolutely powerful and incontrovertible evidence of his [Osama Bin Laden’s] link to the events of the 11th of September.”17 Several days later (on October 4), Blair’s government went public with the evidence to which Blair had alluded — a “Bin Laden Dossier.”18 But the evidence turned out to be short of “incontrovertible,” and in fact was shockingly thin. The Independent described it as “little more than conjecture,”19 and an editorial in the Guardian (U.K.) concluded that the dossier was “almost worthless from a legal point of view.” 20 The Times (London) agreed, observing, “There is no evidence presented [in the dossier] that directly links bin Laden to September 11.”21 The Bin Laden Video and the Personifi cation of Evil onfronted with U.S. demands to hand over bin Laden unconditionally, the Taliban initially was defi ant and refused. However, in early October 2001, two Pakistani Islamic parties persuaded the Taliban leadership to extradite bin Laden to Peshawar, Pakistan, where he would be held under house arrest and tried by an international tribunal.22 The deal even included the extradition of bin Laden to the U.S. in the event of a conviction. However, Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf vetoed the arrangement, likely under pressure from the Bush administration. But why would the U.S. turn down an opportunity to bring the arch villain of 9/11 to justice for the crime of the century? Was it because, as already indicated, the U.S. had insuffi cient evidence to convict and faced the embarrassing likelihood of an acquittal? In fact, the only evidence the U.S. government released linking bin Laden to 9/11 was a videotape which supposedly turned up by chance in Afghanistan. According to the State Department, U.S. military forces found the hour-long video in Jalalabad on December 9, 2001, shortly after the U.S. invasion.23 It purportedly shows bin Laden and several of his al Qaeda comrades ghoulishly celebrating their successful attack upon America.

The U.S. government released the tape on December 13, 2001 along with an English translation and a Department of Defense (DoD) press release. The latter included the following statement by Rumsfeld: “There was no doubt of bin Laden’s responsibility for the September 11 attacks before the tape was discovered.”24 The U.S. media made much of this confessional tape, as did political luminaries like New York City Mayor (and presidential hopeful) Rudy Giuliani, who told CNN that the tape confi rmed that the U.S. military campaign against bin Laden was “more than justifi ed.” Giuliani added, “Obviously, this man is the personifi cation of evil. He seems delighted at having killed more people than he anticipated, which leaves you wondering just how deep his evil heart and soul really is.”25 In the video bin Laden brags about al Qaeda’s role in staging the attack. But is the footage bona fi de? Anyone who has seen the fi lm knows that the main character bears only the most superfi cial resemblance to bin Laden, judging from well-known photos. In addition, there are major discrepancies. For example, the video shows bin Laden writing with his right hand, when according to the FBI he is a southpaw. 26 Two independent translators and a third expert on oriental studies also took issue with the English translation of the Arabic released by the DoD. During the program Monitor, which aired on the German TV channel Das Erste, the three experts stated, “at the most important places where it [i.e, the video] is held to prove the guilt of bin Laden, it [i.e., the translation] is not identical with the Arabic.”27 The experts also disputed the U.S. claim that the tape proved foreknowledge. Gernot Rotter, professor of Islamic and Arabic Studies at the University of Hamburg, stated, “The American translators who listened to the tapes and transcribed them apparently wrote a lot of things in that they wanted to hear, but that cannot be heard on the tape no matter how many times you listen to it.” While this does not necessarily exonerate bin Laden, it does raise questions. If, as Bush claimed, the U.S. had solid evidence of bin Laden’s guilt, then why make false claims? Evidently, the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation agrees with the skeptics. The FBI’s online listing of “Most Wanted Terrorists” includes a webpage devoted to Osama bin Laden. According to this offi cial post, which may be viewed by anyone with access to cyberspace, bin Laden is wanted by the FBI for the August 1998 attacks upon U.S. Embassies in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, and Nairobi, Kenya, which killed over 200 people. 28However, the page makes no reference to the events of September 11, 2001.

Nor is there any mention of the video found in Afghanistan. In June 2006, when blogger Ed Haas learned about this, he was understandably puzzled, and contacted FBI headquarters by phone seeking an explanation. Haas talked with Rex Tomb, the FBI’s Chief of Investigative Publicity, who informed him: “The reason why 9/11 is not mentioned on Osama bin Laden’s Most Wanted page is because the FBI has no hard evidence connecting bin Laden to 9/11.” 29Haas was dumbfounded, and said, “But how is this possible?” Tomb replied that “bin Laden has not been formally charged in connection with 9/11.” He then explained why not: The FBI gathers evidence. Once evidence is gathered, it is turned over to the Department of Justice. The Department of Justice then decides whether it has enough evidence to present to a federal grand jury. In the case of the 1998 United States Embassies being bombed, bin Laden has been formally indicted and charged by a grand jury. He has not been formally indicted and charged in connection with 9/11 because the FBI has no hard evidence connecting bin Laden to 9/11 [my emphasis].30 This admission by the FBI is astonishing and raises fundamental questions about the war on terrorism, as well as the role of the U.S. media. Was Osama bin Laden convicted for the cold-blooded murder of nearly 3,000 innocent Americans in the U.S. court of public opinion by means of a media circus? Did the U.S. government and the corporate media collude to deceive the American people? If so, then a colossal miscarriage of justice has occurred. Consider also the strange statement made by President Bush at a press conference on March 13, 2002. When asked about the progress being made to catch bin Laden, Bush replied, “We haven’t heard much from him. And I wouldn’t necessarily say he’s at the center of any command structure. And, again, I don’t know where he is. I, I’ll repeat what I said. I truly am not that concerned about him” [my emphasis]. $\\underline { { 3 1 } }$ But why this almost lackadaisical attitude about the arch-villain whom Bush had promised to track down to the ends of the earth?

Yet, by at least one account, the U.S. forces at Tora Bora displayed almost unbelievable incompetence during the pursuit of bin Laden, as a result of which the accused and most of his entourage escaped.32 Was this the plan all along? A no-less-strange remark made a few weeks later (April 6, 2002) by General Richard Myers, then Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, suggests that bin Laden’s getaway had been approved at the highest level. Myers told CNN that “the goal has never been to get bin Laden.”33 I personally found his statement incomprehensible, since at the time Osama was public enemy number one. Did the U.S. allow bin Laden to escape because the Bush administration judged he was more valuable at large? We can’t be certain, because by this time there were also numerous reports that bin Laden was dead.34 Did President Bush know when he made the statement noted above that bin Laden was already deceased? This would explain Bush’s casual demeanor. Yet, either way, from the standpoint of propaganda it hardly mattered whether bin Laden was dead or alive. His larger-than-life reputation could be sustained simply by neglecting to confi rm his death, and the legend is what counted. His persona could also be “spun” in various ways and made to serve political expedience. Indeed by this logic, bin Laden was even more valuable dead, because a living breathing bin Laden might at some point be apprehended, in which case the Bush administration faced the unwelcome prospect of a very public trial at which the terrorist would have an opportunity to tell his side of the story to a listening world. And this, of course, had to be avoided. If we can believe the 9/11 Commission Report, the case against bin Laden was greatly bolstered by the capture and subsequent confession in 2003 of the alleged 9/11 mastermind, Khalid Sheikh Mohammed (KSM). The problem, of course, as already noted in my introduction, is that the offi cial story about the plot against America is wholly based on secret CIA interrogations that have never been independently confi rmed, and must therefore be viewed as suspect. But even if we accept the testimony of KSM in 2003, this does not explain the rush to war in 2001. Nor does it explain President Bush’s decision to go to war against Saddam Hussein — a decision reportedly made in July 2002.35 Previous cases of terrorism had already demonstrated the wisdom of proceeding with caution,", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:The 9_11 Mystery Plane - Mark H.

Nor does it explain President Bush’s decision to go to war against Saddam Hussein — a decision reportedly made in July 2002.35 Previous cases of terrorism had already demonstrated the wisdom of proceeding with caution, since knee-jerk responses can (and do) misfi re. For example, after the 1995 bombing of the Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City, U.S. investigators at fi rst suspected a Mideast connection. But this was proved false, and similar errors were made after the 1988 downing of Pan American Flight 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland. Although initial evidence pointed to Syria or Iran, a thorough forensic investigation ruled them out and eventually implicated Libya. The 9/11 Commission Report itself describes the latter case as “a cautionary tale about rushing to judgment in attributing responsibility for a terrorist act.”36 So, why the rush to war after the September 11 attack? If the Bush administration had conclusive evidence that al Qaeda was responsible, why not release it? Was the Bush White House tight-lipped because the actual evidence would have exposed the complicity of the U.S. military and intelligence community? A stunning story that broke in the U.S. press in 2005 points to such a conclusion. As it happened, a legitimate U.S. military counter-terrorist operation known as Able Danger was tracking Mohamed Atta and his cohorts as early as January-February 2000. The operation, based at Ft. Belvoir, Virginia, was small but extremely high-tech, as it employed advanced computers to sweep the Internet, a methodology known as as data-mining. In May 2000, however, when Able Danger’s success became known throughout the Defense Department, the offi cers who ran it were ordered to shut it down and destroy their data. 37One offi cer reportedly was threatened with prison if he refused. One intelligence offi cer who later testifi ed anyway, Lt. Col. Anthony Shaffer, was targeted for harassment. The question is why? Of course, the standard explanation is that the military bureaucracy made gross blunders and later sought to cover up their incompetence. But there is another possibility. Was Able Danger shut down because this honest operation “threatened” to unmask the covert planning for the September 11 “attack”? What is clear is that the Pentagon’s self-serving attempts to gag and discredit Lt. Col. Shaffer are not to be believed. In February 2006 Shaffer told the House Armed Services Committee that during the summer of 2000, he and other offi cers involved in Able Danger attempted on three separate occasions to warn the FBI about the terrorist threat posed by Mohamed Atta.

But the meetings never happened. Each time they were canceled at the last minute by high-level Pentagon attorneys.39 Nor has the Pentagon ever provided a satisfactory explanation as to why. 40 Some time after the dissolution of Able Danger, Shaffer was reassigned to Bagram Air Base, Afghanistan, where in October 2003 he succeeded in bringing the existence of Able Danger to the attention of the 9/11 Commission. This apparently happened due to a chance encounter with Philip Zelikow, Executive Director of the commission, and several commission staffers who were then on tour — gathering fi rsthand information about the U.S. war on terrorism. Lt. Col. Shaffer told the House committee that after he briefed the commission staff about Able Danger’s success in identifying Mohamed Atta and other alleged 9/11 hijackers, Zelikow came up, handed him his card, and asked him to “please contact me upon your return to the states so we can continue this dialogue.”41 However, three months later when Shaffer did just that, he was surprised to discover that Zelikow was no longer interested in Able Danger. But why wouldn’t he be? Then all hell broke loose, when Shaffer dutifully informed his commanding offi cer about the contact. From that point on, Lt. Col. Shaffer was subjected to the sort of military hazing that is usually reserved for green recruits. His security clearance was cancelled. He lost access to his offi ce computer and all of his classifi ed materials about Able Danger, which — he later learned — were destroyed. (Subsequently, the Pentagon dismissed his testimony, claiming it was unsupported by hard evidence, an obvious case of Catch-22.) Shaffer also learned that he was under investigation, although no formal charges were ever fi led against him. He was told “off the record” that he had “pissed off” one or more high-ranking offi cers. Several of Shaffer’s colleagues from Able Danger corroborated his story, but it didn’t matter. His military career was over — destroyed.42 Shaffer’s testimony before Congress is riveting, and it is essential reading for anyone interested in 9/11 truth. In their 2006 book Without Precedent, Thomas Kean and Lee Hamilton, cochairs of the 9/11 Commission, deny that Able Danger had ever identifi ed Mohamed Atta before 9/11.43 But their assertion, much belated, is just not credible.

Was covert planning for 9/11 already underway during the Clinton administration? It is curious that CIA Director George Tenet in 2002 told a closed session of a joint House-Senate panel investigating the 9/11 “security failure” that al-Qaeda’s planning of the September 11, 2001 attack started as early as 1998.46 But how could Tenet know this unless the CIA had been tracking bin Laden all along? As a matter of fact, we know they were! According to several UPI reports, the National Security Agency (NSA) acknowledged in February 2001 that the use of advanced Echelon software enabled the U.S. intelligence community to eavesdrop on thousands of bin Laden’s cell phone calls over a period of years. U.S. offi cials disclosed that even after bin Laden began to encrypt certain calls in 1995, his “codes were broken.”47 The date 1998 is doubly curious. That same year, Tenet informed the Senate Intelligence Committee that the CIA’s strategy to defeat al Qaeda included the recruiting of al Qaeda operatives.48 In his memoirs Tenet goes even further with an assertion that is remarkable for its candor. He writes, “… the [9/11] commission failed to recognize the sustained comprehensive efforts conducted by the intelligence community prior to 9/11 to penetrate the al Qaeda organization.”49 I had to re-read this passage several times just to believe my own eyes. Did the CIA recruit terrorists who were then used as patsies on 9/11? Bush offi cials, of course, have steadfastly denied that the U.S. successfully penetrated al Qaeda before 9/11.

But their denials are less than persuasive in light of Lt. Col. Shaffer’s testimony about Able Danger, and also because we know that the monitoring of phone calls continued. After al Qaeda bombed two U.S. embassies in East Africa in August 1998, FBI investigators got lucky and stumbled upon an al Qaeda communications hub in Yemen. According to writer The hub was a private telephone — anything but high tech. The switchboard operator turned out to be the brother-in-law of Khalid al- Midhar, one of the nineteen alleged hijackers. His job in Yemen was simply to relay messages to and from various al Qaeda operatives, including bin Laden. 51From phone records U.S. investigators confi rmed a fl urry of calls through the hub before the embassy bombings, and this pattern was repeated before the attack on the USS Cole in October 2000. 52Indeed, it is unclear why U.S. intelligence agencies failed to prevent the attack on the Cole, because by this time they were surely listening. The al Qaeda hub was allowed to operate right up until September 11, 2001, and even after. Incredible as this sounds, U.S. and Yemeni authorities did not fi nally move in and close it down until 2002.53 Based on this evidence, gleaned from open sources in the U.S. media, we must conclude that the U.S. intelligence community was tracking al Qaeda’s nearly every move before 9/11 — and had been for years — probably including the entry of the alleged hijackers into the U.S., their “fl ight training,” and subsequent movements. The phone intercepts certainly continued. In June 2002 both the Miami Herald and the Dallas Star-Telegram reported that in the summer of 2001 the NSA even monitored phone conversations between alleged 9/11 lead hijacker Mohamed Atta and alleged 9/11 mastermind Khalid Sheikh Mohammed.54 The papers reported that the NSA “did not recognize the signifi cance of what they had.” Evidently, we are supposed to believe that the NSA did not pass along this important intelligence to the CIA. But this is absurd. After all, the NSA is a part of the U.S. Department of Defense and exists for the purpose of providing intelligence to the CIA and the U.S. military.

Did elements of the U.S. intelligence community know about al Qaeda’s multiple hijacking operation all along? Did they, then, covertly piggy-back their own planning on top of it, thereby insuring the attack’s “success” while also manipulating it for their own ignoble ends? If true, this would easily explain why the Pentagon shut down Able Danger in May 2000. It would explain the Pentagon’s gag order imposed upon the Able Danger staffers, which blunted a Congressional inquiry. It would also explain the carefully orchestrated smear campaign aimed at Lt. Col. Shaffer, who did his patriotic duty and was made to pay a terrible price. It would explain why the DoD fed phony or incomplete information about Able Danger to co-chairs Kean and Hamilton, and other members of the commission, to persuade them that the data-mining effort was “insignifi cant.” It would also explain why, time and again, during the period before 9/11, the CIA withheld critical information from the FBI, information which, had it become known, would have enabled the FBI to foil the 9/11 attack. The FBI was always just one or two critical pieces of information short of putting together the plot. Nor has the CIA disconnect ever been adequately explained.56 The standard excuses, bureaucratic bungling and interagency rivalry, are simply not persuasive. This interpretation would also explain why George Tenet lied during the 9/11 Commission hearings when he denied his meetings with President Bush in August 2001. Indeed, it might even explain why President elect G.W. Bush retained Tenet, a Clinton appointee, as his CIA chief. The move was one of Bush’s fi rst decisions as president and was most unusual, especially given the neocons’ scarcely concealed scorn for the Clinton administration. However, it makes perfect sense, assuming that when Bush took offi ce elements of the CIA and U.S. military were already deeply involved in the covert planning for the 9/11 attack. Continuity at the CIA would have been essential. As far as I know, author Ian Henshall was the fi rst to make this connection.57 And let us not forget: During the period before 9/11, the CIA Director visited the White House on a daily basis.

Only a very few individuals at the top would have been fully briefed. A no less shocking story, appearing in the prestigious French paper Le Figaro on October 11, 2001, points to the same conclusion. The story claimed that bin Laden was actually under the protection of U.S. security agencies prior to the 9/11 attack. According to Le Figaro, bin Laden checked in to the American Hospital in Dubai, one of the Arab Emirates located along the Persian Gulf, on July 4, 2001, just two months before 9/11, where he received medical treatment over a ten-day period for a serious kidney ailment.59 The story seems based in fact, because it includes many details: Bin Laden was reportedly accompanied by his personal physician, a nurse, four bodyguards, and at least one of his lieutenants. It also states that the local CIA station chief, evidently a well known fi gure in the tiny country, was seen entering bin Laden’s hospital suite during his stay, and immediately after the meeting caught a fl ight back to the U.S. If the story is accurate, bin Laden held court from his hospital room, welcoming various members of his extended family, as well as prominent Saudis and Emiratis. It is no secret that bin Laden suffered from kidney disease. Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif had informed the Clinton administration about bin Laden’s deteriorating health as early as 1998, during a state visit to Washington.60 A followup report in the Guardian (U.K.) on November 1, 2001 confi rmed the above story and added further details, noting that bin Laden’s Saudi guests included Prince Turki al Faisal, who was then head of Saudi intelligence. The article in the Guardian names French intelligence as the source of the story in Le Figaro. It also claims the information was leaked because the French were “keen to reveal the ambiguous role of the CIA and to restrain Washington from extending the war to Iraq and elsewhere.” Given that bin Laden was already wanted at the time for the U.S. embassy bombings in Nairobi and Dar es Salaam, why did the U.S. not arrange to have local authorities snatch the terrorist in Dubai, in order to bring him to justice? Of course, it goes without saying that bin Laden would never have visited the U.S. hospital in the fi rst place had he not been confi dent of his protected status. Do we dare to connect these dots?

Of course, it goes without saying that bin Laden would never have visited the U.S. hospital in the fi rst place had he not been confi dent of his protected status. Do we dare to connect these dots? Surely the story in Le Figaro suggests that elements of the U.S. intelligence establishment knew about the coming 9/11 attack and allowed bin Laden to remain free to play his assigned role as a patsy. Such a conclusion is supported by powerful evidence that fi rst came to light on November 6, 2001, when the BBC program Newsnight produced FBI documents showing that soon after G.W. Bush entered offi ce, the White House ordered the FBI to “back off” from ongoing investigations of Osama bin Laden and other members of his family, some of whom were living in the U.S. at the time. 61To the best of my knowledge, none of these stories from European and U.K. press were ever reported in the U.S. media. Again, why not? Were elements of the U.S. government and intelligence community complicit in the events of September 11, 2001? Did they allow the attack to happen, or even help to stage it, in order to generate the pretext for a much more aggressive U.S. foreign policy which the American people would not otherwise support? Either way, the implications are shocking — so shocking that many of our fellow countrymen (and women) cannot bring themselves to even think such thoughts. Yet, it is a matter of record that the neoconservatives openly advocated an imperial shift in U.S. foreign policy before the November 2000 election.62 Moreover, President Clinton was already moving in this direction, as I will show in a later chapter. 6 The three U.S. offi cials were Tom Simmons, a former U.S. Ambassador to Pakistan, Karl Inderfurth, former Assistant Secretary of State for Asian Affairs, and Lee Coldren, a former State Department expert on south Asia.

In the fi rst hours after the attack, the fi res hampered the search for survivors. Later, they hindered the cleanup. Joel Meyerowitz, a photographer from New York, documented all of this in his retrospective photo album, Aftermath, published in 2006. Armed with his trusty camera, Meyerowitz roamed the WTC ruin in the days and weeks after the attack. Although police ejected him from the site many times, he kept returning and eventually amassed an impressive photographic record of the crews working amidst twisted steel and smoking debris. Meyerowitz writes in his book that the ground was so hot that it melted the workmen’s rubber boots. But he was not the fi rst to report the incredible heat. The earliest accounts of molten steel came from the fi rst-responders. In 2002, Sarah Atlas, a member of New Jersey Task Force One Search and Rescue, was one of these. She told of seeing molten steel in the pile even as she searched in vain for survivors.1 Another responder explained how he “crawled through an opening and down crumpled stairwells to the subway, fi ve levels below ground,” where in the darkness he saw “a distant, pinkish glow: molten metal dripping from a beam.”2 There were many such accounts, too many to dismiss. Yet, this is exactly what proponents of the offi cial 9/11 narrative have done. It is what they must do since the presence of melted steel or iron at Ground Zero cannot be reconciled with the offi cial story, according to which nineteen Islamic extremists hijacked four commercial planes — in the process outsmarting the entire U.S. military establishment — and fl ew two of them into the World Trade Center and one into the Pentagon. The high-speed impacts and subsequent fi res — we are told — fatally weakened the steel-frame twin towers, leading to a global structural failure in each case.

The high-speed impacts and subsequent fi res — we are told — fatally weakened the steel-frame twin towers, leading to a global structural failure in each case. The collapse of WTC-7 involved no plane crash and somehow was caused by fi re alone, but exactly how has never been explained. The accounts of molten steel are profoundly subversive to this offi cial story, for reasons that will become clear as we proceed. And it is no wonder that for this reason supporters of the offi cial narrative persistently ignore these eyewitnesses, when not actively trying to discredit them. Never do they try to account for them. Debunkers of “conspiracy theories” frequently remind us that witnesses to a horrifi c event often give widely varying accounts, and on this basis we are supposed to conclude that the eyewitnesses at Ground Zero did not see what they say they saw. Either the witnesses were not competent to judge, or they were in a state of shock, or maybe they just got it wrong. Such blanket dismissals are often accompanied by a throw-away line, or a wave of the arm, some gesture that makes the testimonials go away as if by magic — along with the molten steel. Occasionally, we get the woo-woo treatment. The critics roll their eyes, a nonetoo-subtle hint that the fi remen or other trained professionals must have been drunk while on duty, or in an altered state, on drugs perhaps, or for whatever reason of unsound mind. Some even insinuate that the stories of molten iron are a colossal hoax, orchestrated perhaps by al Qaeda sympathizers to weaken our national will and divert us from our united purpose, i.e., the war on terror. According to this view, the eyewitnesses are not only wrong, they are traitors. The problem with all of these arguments is the remarkable unanimity of the witnesses, nearly all of whom agree about what they saw — this and the physical evidence backing them up — which I will present shortly. Incidentally, we are extremely fortunate that physical evidence did survive, since the City of New York and the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) wasted no time removing the steel wreckage from the WTC site. According to a May 2002 Congressional report: In the month that lapsed between the terrorist attacks and the deployment of the BPAT team [FEMA’s Building Performance Assessment Team], a signifi cant amount of steel debris — including most of the steel from the upper fl oors — was removed from the rubble pile, cut into smaller sections, and either", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:The 9_11 Mystery Plane - Mark H.

After a crime, it is standard procedure to cordon off the scene and sequester all evidence until it can be analyzed. Indeed, the removal or destruction of evidence is itself a serious crime. Local and federal authorities should have responded to the worst “terrorist attack” in U.S. history by immediately sealing off Ground Zero, until a team of forensic experts could examine the steel debris and determine the cause of the unprecedented structural failure. Never before, after all, had a steel-frame skyscraper collapsed due to fi re, nor have any since. Yet on 9/11, three such “failures” occurred in a single day. From the standpoint of building design and public safety alone, the need for a thorough investigation was obvious. Such investigations are, in fact, standard procedure after airline crashes and mid-air disasters. After the tragic 1996 crash of TWA Flight 800, which killed 230 passengers, federal agencies spent nearly $50 million raising the remains of the crashed Boeing 747 from the fl oor of the Atlantic Ocean, crossexamining eyewitnesses, and reconstructing the tragedy. After a massive salvage operation, investigators reportedly recovered 96% of the plane. $\\underline { { 4 } } _ { \\mathrm { A } }$ similar effort after the Columbia space shuttle disaster spent nearly as much: about $40 million. $\\boldsymbol { \\underline { { 5 } } } \\mathbf { Y } \\mathrm { e t }$ , after the worst “terrorist attack” in U.S. history, the preliminary FEMA investigation limped along on a budget of $1 million or less, which was plainly inadequate.

Dr. Frederick W. Mowrer, a professor of fi re protection engineering at the University of Maryland, told the New York Times, “I fi nd the speed with which potentially important evidence has been removed and recycled to be appalling.”7 In a January 2002 article, “Selling Out the Investigation,” in Fire Engineering Magazine, editor Bill Manning complained about the destruction of evidence and called FEMA’s investigation a “half-baked farce.” 8Manning was no “conspiracy theorist.” But he was outraged by legitimate concerns about public safety. Did high-placed individuals order the rapid removal of steel to impede the investigation of the WTC collapse? But why would they do so if 9/11 was the work of foreign terrorists? We still do not know who gave this order. The Mayor’s offi ce refused to name the individual, despite written and oral requests from the Times. 9 What is perfectly clear is that the eyewitnesses and the debunkers of “conspiracy theories” cannot both be correct. If the former are telling the truth, then the offi cial story about what happened on 9/11 must be wrong — very wrong. The question about who is correct, therefore, is of paramount importance, and at the risk of seeming redundant I am going to present more testimonials, to establish the fact that we are not talking about a few eyewitnesses, but many. I will then review the physical evidence. The witnesses who reported molten steel included fi remen, city offi cials, contractors, workers, and trained professionals who toured the ruin. One of the latter, Dr. Keith Eaton, Chief Executive of the London-based Institution of Structural Engineers, later wrote in The Structural Engineer about what he saw, namely: “molten metal which was still red-hot weeks after the event,” as well as “four-inch thick steel plates sheared and bent in the disaster.”10 A similar account came from Leslie E. Robertson, the engineer of record who helped to design the World Trade Center. Robertson’s consulting fi rm Leslie E. Robertson Associates (LERA) worked in the WTC complex for 40 years, and at the time of the tragedy was still under contract to the Port Authority, which administered the WTC. In a keynote address before the Structural Engineers Association of Utah Robertson said,“… as of 21 days after the attack the fi res were still burning and molten steel still running.”11 In a subsequent interview, Robertson retreated from his statement.12 But one of his own associates, Richard Garlock, was also a witness.

Garlock, a structural engineer at LERA, was brought in after the WTC collapse to assess the danger to rescue teams who were then scouring the ruin for survivors. Garlock used the architectural plans of the WTC to help responders safely navigate the pile of wreckage. He also personally undertook a number of reconnaissance missions into the ruin. Later, during a PBS special, America Rebuilds, Garlock described his experience: Going below, it was smoky and really hot. We had rescue teams with meters for oxygen and carbon dioxide. They also had temperature monitors. Here [explaining a photo] WTC 6 is over my head. The debris past the columns was red-hot, molten, running. I did some quick numbers with Gary Panariello, an engineer from Thornton-Tomasetti, to try and determine what the load on WTC-6 was, and how much of the lateral system of the building the contractor could take down. There were a lot of judgment calls …13 As rubble is removed from piles, random pockets of steel, glowing brilliant red, are uncovered. Sometimes new fi res erupt. Sometimes the steel just glows because there is nothing left nearby to burn. A curious phenomenon, no fuel to burn, but something, heat migrating through the pile, continues to keep the steel at over 1, 000^(∘) F. When that happens, work stops, equipment pulls back, and the fi refi ghters put thousands of gallons of water on the piles to cool them down. Huge billowing clouds of steam are created, and we wait.14 The eyewitness raises an important point. Indeed, what burning fuel caused such intense heat in the wreckage? Although this engineer was unnamed, he was part of a team of health and safety engineers from Bechtel Group Inc. The team was led by Bechtel vice president, Stewart C. Burkhammer, P.E., CSP., who described the conditions at Ground Zero in an article published the following year in a professional journal: The debris pile at Ground Zero was always tremendously hot. Thermal measurements taken by helicopter each day showed underground temperatures ranging from 400^(∘) F to more than 2, 800^(∘) F. The surface was so hot that standing too long in one spot softened (and even melted) the soles of our safety shoes. Steel toes would often heat up and become intolerable. This heat was also a concern for the search-and-rescue dogs used at the site. Many were not outfi tted with protective booties. More than one suffered serious injuries and at least three died while working at Ground Zero.15 Later,", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:The 9_11 Mystery Plane - Mark H.

But, notice, the Bechtel engineer mentions 2, 800^(∘)F , the melting point of steel. Ron Burger, a public health advisor at the National Center for Environmental Health, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, also visited Ground Zero. Burger arrived the day after the attack and, after touring the site, compared the ruins to a volcano: “Feeling the heat, seeing the molten steel, the layers upon layers of ash, like lava, it reminded me of Mt. St. Helen’s and the thousands who fl ed that disaster.”16 Firemen used similar language, likening the site to “a foundry” or a “lava fl ow.”17 As the cleanup progressed, more evidence accumulated. Numerous witnesses reported seeing red-hot beams being pulled from the pile of wreckage. Sometimes the beams were dripping with molten steel. 189/11 scholar David Ray Griffi n compiled several of these eyewitness accounts in his 2007 book Debunking 9/11 Debunking, which I recommend to readers. 19Public health offi cials also toured the scene of destruction. One of them, Alison Geyh, Ph.D., an assistant professor of Environmental Health at Johns Hopkins, later wrote, “In some pockets now being uncovered they are fi nding molten steel.”20 The witnesses included New York City sanitation workers, who helped with the cleanup by hauling scrap steel from Ground Zero to the Fresh Kills landfi ll. New York Department of Sanitation spokeswoman Kathy Dawkins explained that the waste “included everything from molten steel beams to human remains.”21 The molten steel was even reported by Kenneth Holden, City Commissioner of New York, in his testimony before the 9/11 Commission. Holden described the atmosphere at Ground Zero as “surreal.” He told the panel that the WTC site “was still so hot that molten metal dripped down the sides of the wall from Building 6.” 22Although Holden’s statement is not mentioned in the commission’s fi nal report — a conspicuous omission, since he was a city offi cial — it is supported by William Langewiesche, one of the few journalists who managed to gain access to the WTC foundation hole or “bathtub.” In a 2003 book about the 9/11 disaster, American Ground, Langewiesche writes about “streams of molten metal that leaked from the hot cores and fl owed down broken walls inside the foundation hole.”23 As crews removed the mountain of wreckage, they discovered additional evidence: pools of molten metal where the towers had once stood,", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:The 9_11 Mystery Plane - Mark H.

Some of these pools were not found until three, four, even fi ve weeks after 9/11. Contractors working on site confi rmed these discoveries, including Peter Tully, president of The same interview included a statement by another contractor, Mark Loizeaux, president of Controlled Demolition, Inc., who, six years before had ramrodded the cleanup of the bombed Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City. After September 11 Loizeaux was brought in for the same reason, i.e., to draft a clean-up plan for the WTC site. He told the American Free Press, “Yes, hot spots of molten steel were seen in the basements.” Molten steel was also found under Building 7. The reports were confi rmed by Herb Trimpe, an Episcopalian minister who served as chaplain at Ground Zero for the American Red Cross. In a subsequent interview, Trimpe explained that he “talked to many contractors and they said they actually saw molten metal trapped, beams had just totally been melted because of the heat.” 25The eyewitnesses included volunteers, such as Guy Lounsbury, a member of the New York Air National Guard’s 109th Air Wing, who volunteered at Ground Zero from September 22 to October 6, 2001. Lounsbury later wrote that a fi reman told him “there was still molten steel at the heart of the towers.”26 A movie review of the documentary fi lm Collateral Damage also cited testimonials by NYC fi remen, who reportedly described heat so intense they saw “rivers of molten steel.”27 The fi res were so intense that millions of gallons of water initially sprayed on the smoking ruins by NYC fi remen had no effect. Nor did heavy rain on September 14. The pile continued to burn and produced heavy smoke emissions that interfered with the fi rst attempts to study the site from the air. On September 15 mapping experts from Hunter College of NYC brought in a special laser camera (LIDAR) capable of penetrating the smoke, which they used in concert with global positioning to generate the fi rst accurate maps and thermal images of Ground Zero. These maps became an important resource during the rescue and clean-up operations. 28Thereafter, over-fl ights continued every two days.

On September 16, 2001 the National Aeronautics and Space Administration surveyed lower Manhattan from the air using an infrared spectrometer (AVIRIS), which confi rmed dozens of “hot spots” in the wreckage. This work was done in collaboration with the U.S. Geologic Survey. The hottest spots were in the ruins of WTC 2 and WTC 7, where NASA recorded surface temperatures as high as 747^(∘)C (1, 376^(∘)F) . 29The temperatures under the pile were no doubt much hotter — hot enough to evaporate rain and water long before it trickled to the bottom. Amazingly, molten steel was still being reported two months after the fi res were offi cially declared out. As late as February 2002, NYC fi reman Joe “Toolie” O’Toole reportedly observed a crane operator “lift a steel beam vertically from deep within the catacombs of Ground Zero. It was dripping from the molten steel.” $\\underline { { 3 0 } }$ These reports have never been explained. Mark Loizeaux told the American Free Press that the continuing fi res were fueled by “paper, carpet and other combustibles packed down the elevator shafts by the tower fl oors as they ‘pancaked’ into the basement.” Manuel Garcia, a physicist, has suggested that cars left in parking garages under the WTC contained gasoline that may have fueled the fi res.31 Loizeaux and Garcia are probably both correct and, no doubt, there were other combustibles in the pile. But the fact remains that none of these, nor any other fuels that are known to have been present in the World Trade Center, had suffi cient potential energy to even approach the melting point of construction grade steel beams (2, 800^(∘)F) . For this reason the observed presence of molten steel or iron under the pile is extraordinary. Indeed, it is anomalous and cannot be reconciled with the offi cial version of events. Surely this is why government offi cials have assiduously ignored these accounts, when not making vigorous efforts to discredit them.

FEMA admits that with regard to Building Seven, even “the best hypothesis has a low probability of occurrence.” 34Although the FEMA report makes no mention of molten steel, a scientifi c paper attached to it as an appendix did mention some important evidence, which I will discuss shortly. The second offi cial investigation was the 9/11 Commission Report, released in July 2004. Although the U.S. media often describes it as the defi nite record, in reality this highly selective report culled or excluded everything that did not agree with the offi cial version of events, including, as noted, the testimony of NYC Commissioner Kenneth Holden, who told the panel he saw molten steel with his own eyes. The 567-page report never once mentions molten steel, nor does it discuss WTC-7. Evidently, the sudden collapse of a 47-story steel-frame skyscraper into its own footprint was not deemed important enough even to mention. These omissions are all the more glaring because the panel’s mandate was “to provide the fullest possible account of the events surrounding 9/11.”35 It is also worth mentioning that the commission was made up almost entirely of lawyers and politicians, and as a group was sorely lacking in scientifi c credentials. The third offi cial investigation was prepared by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), an arm of the Bush administration’s Department of Commerce.36 NIST was tasked to pick up the investigation of the WTC collapse where FEMA left off. Three years later, in September 2005, NIST released a forty-three-volume 10,000-page report of its own that managed to avoid altogether the issue of the molten steel. 37True, NIST did subsequently mention the issue — briefl y — in a separate “Frequently Asked Questions” (FAQ) section that was added to the report a year later as a kind of afterthought, evidently for the purpose of making its fi ndings both more accessible and acceptable to the public. This separate addendum dismisses the issue with the following bizarre statement: NIST investigators … found no evidence that would support the melting of steel in a jet-fuel ignited fi re in the towers prior to collapse.

The condition of the steel in the wreckage of the WTC towers (i.e., whether it was in a molten state or not) was irrelevant to the investigation of the collapse since it does not provide any conclusive information on the condition of the steel when the WTC towers were standing [my emphasis].38 This statement by NIST dodges the key question. If the “jet-fuel ignited fi res” did not melt the steel, then what did? Indeed, in that case, how do we explain the many eyewitnesses accounts? After disavowing the molten steel issue as “irrelevant,” NIST then makes the following no less bizarre hedge: Under certain circumstances it is conceivable for some of the steel in the wreckage to have melted after the buildings collapsed [my emphasis]. Any molten steel in the wreckage was more likely due to the high temperature resulting from long exposure to combustion within the pile than to short exposure to fi res or explosions while the buildings were standing.39 NIST never informs us what the “certain circumstances” that prevailed in the pile might have been. NIST also ignores the accounts of fi rst responders who witnessed molten metal on their arrival at the scene within minutes or hours of the collapse. Obviously, the molten steel they encountered had been produced during or before the collapse — not after. In fact, NIST’s above statement that “long exposure to combustion” may have produced pools of molten steel after the collapse is hogwash, since no one, including NIST, has identifi ed an energy source in the rubble pile remotely capable of melting steel. But I will go even further: NIST’s statement is an affront to our intelligence, because the residual hot spots identifi ed at the WTC site after 9/11 and the molten pools surely were related. There is no way to avoid the conclusion that both were the result of whatever caused the WTC collapse in the fi rst place. Something on September 11, 2001 burned hot enough to melt steel in the twin towers. But such a deduction was evidently too obvious or too provocative for NIST scientists, who made a decision “not to go there,” a decision — I should add — that appears to have been politically motivated.

It’s easy to show that jet fuel was not the causative agent. Jet fuel simply does not burn with suffi cient energy to melt steel — not even close. Many of the early reports by the U.S. and world press erred in this respect. In the emotional aftermath of 9/11, the press often mangled the science as badly as the twisted steel beams in the pile at Ground Zero. One report posted by the BBC on September 13, 2001 quoted experts who stated matterof-factly that the burning jet fuel had melted the WTC’s central columns, leading to the collapse.41 The day after the attack, NewScientist.com asserted that “raging fi res melted the supporting steel struts.” 42That same day, the Sunday Times interviewed Hyman Brown, a civil engineering professor at the University of Colorado: “Steel melts,” Brown told the Times. “90,850 liters of aviation fl uid melted the steel. Nothing is designed … to withstand that fi re.” Years before, Brown had worked as a project engineer in the construction of the WTC.43 Incidentally, Brown was wrong about the amount of jet fuel. FEMA determined that the planes were not fully loaded and carried no more than 10,000 gallons, or about 40,000 liters, which was consumed within minutes. 44Later, NIST agreed.45 On September 13, 2001 BBC radio interviewed Chris Wise, an engineer who gave this explanation: It was the fi re that killed the buildings. There’s nothing on earth that could survive those temperatures with that amount of fuel burning. The columns would have melted, the fl oors would have melted, and eventually they would have collapsed one on top of the other. 46Elmer Obermeyer, the president of an Ohio engineering fi rm, also endorsed the meltdown theory in a story in the Cincinnati Business Courier. The paper noted that Obermeyer was a “guru in his fi eld.”47 In October 2001 Scientifi cAmerican.com posted an article summarizing the results of a “9/11 panel” of MIT experts, one of whom, Eduardo Kausel, stated “that the intense heat softened or melted the structural elements — fl oor trusses and columns–— so that they became like chewing gum, and that was enough to trigger the collapse.48 This is but a small sampling of the many erroneous reports in the media during those fi rst emotional days.

A lot of people fi gured that’s what melted the steel. Indeed, it did not, the steel did not melt.” The fi re is the most misunderstood part of the WTC collapse. Even today the media report (and many scientists believe) that the steel melted. It is argued that the jet fuel burns very hot, especially with so much fuel present. This is not true…. The temperatures of the fi re at the WTC were not unusual, and it was most defi nitely not capable of melting steel.50 When trained professionals get it wrong, we should not be surprised by the mistakes of journalists and politicians, few of whom are trained in physics. The fact is that jet fuel, which is essentially kerosene, will not burn in air in excess of about 1, 832^(∘)F 1, 000^(∘)C) — nowhere near the 2, 800^(∘)F melting point of steel. $\\underline { { 5 1 } }$ Even this 1, 832^(∘)F upper limit is very diffi cult to achieve, since, as Thomas Eagar also pointed out, it requires the optimal mixing of fuel with oxygen during combustion, which can only be achieved in a laboratory, or on a stovetop. The clouds of black smoke that poured out of the twin towers on 9/11 were an obvious clue that the WTC fi re burned at much lower temperatures, probably around 1, 202^(∘)F (650^(∘)C) range, or even lower. This was due to the ineffi cient mixing of oxygen: why most building fi res burn no hotter than around 932 -1, 202^(∘)F (500 − 650^(∘)C) . But if the burning jet fuel did not melt the WTC steel beams, then how do we explain the eyewitness accounts? What were those fi reman, engineers, workers, contractors and health professionals looking at? Were they all blind or incompetent? No, I think not, because compelling physical evidence supports their testimony — evidence that all three offi cial investigations took pains to ignore. Much of this evidence was literally “in the air” over Manhattan in the days and weeks following September 11, 2001. As we will learn, it also posed serious health risks for local residents and workers involved in the cleanup.

The plume of dust and smoke that poured out of the WTC on 9/11 was large enough to be visible from space. New Yorkers who were unlucky enough to be near the towers when they came down said it was like being in a tornado. Survivors told how, even as they fl ed for their lives, they could feel the intense heat behind them. One man who was 100 yards from the South Tower described the harrowing experience: “It was like being hit by hot gravel. The noise kept coming and coming. One second I was running and the next I was fl ying.”52 The man was lifted off his feet and propelled forward. Many others were thrown to the ground. The dust consisted of hundreds of thousands of tons of pulverized asbestos, glass, gypsum, concrete and other construction materials, including paint, insulation, fl ooring, vermiculite, fi berglass, foam, plaster, computers, furniture, masonry, etc. Most of the cloud was comprised of coarser materials that soon deposited on the WTC site and in the surrounding neighborhood. Even so, the cloud was immense, and some of the dust continued to swirl over lower Manhattan until heavy rains cleared the air on September 14-15. Later, workmen stirred it up again when they brought in heavy equipment and started the cleanup. The ubiquitous dust was highly alkaline, with a PH as high as 12 due to the presence of so much cement, the main constituent of both gypsum and concrete. For this reason the dust was also extremely caustic. One expert described its impact on human tissue as “brutal.” Others agreed. It was like breathing drano.53 The coarser particles and asbestos contributed to the “World Trade Center cough” and other chronic ailments that have since affl icted nearly 70% of responders.54 But the worst dangers were unseen. The pile continued to emit an acrid plume for many weeks. In late September a team of atmospheric scientists from the University of California (Davis), known as the DELTA Group, arrived in New York with state-of-the-art equipment and set up a rooftop station about a mile NNE of Ground Zero. From there they proceeded to monitor the air from early October through late-December 2001. $\\underline { { 5 5 } } ^ { \\prime }$ Thomas Cahill, spokesman for the team, later told the press that the color of the plume is what initially drew his attention.

It was a light blue,” he said. “My background is atmospheric physics, and the color of the plume tells me a lot. A light blue plume means very fi ne particles. Clearly, the pile was still hot and was giving off very fi ne particles.”56 The data collected by the DELTA Group confi rmed Cahill’s early suspicions. The team measured extremely fi ne particulates down into the submicron (or nano) range that according to Cahill were “probably associated with high temperatures in the underground debris pile.” 57Toxic particles of this size are especially dangerous because they pass into the blood with ease via the lungs. The largest spike occurred in a sample taken in one 45-minute period on October 3rd: a whopping 58 μg (micrograms) of material per cubic meter, including transition metals, sulfuric acid, silica, i.e., glass, and many kinds of organic chemicals, some of which had never before been detected in the atmosphere. Many of the chemicals were known carcinogens. Although Cahill had spent the better part of a career testing air samples from pollution events around the world, he had never seen anything like this. “Even on the worst air days in Beijing,” he said, “downwind from coal-fi red power plants, or in the Kuwaiti oil fi res, we did not see these levels of very fi ne particulates.” Some of the metals in their fi ne-mode particle form, such as vanadium, turned up in the highest concentrations ever recorded in the United States.58 Unfortunately, the impending health disaster in New York City immediately collided with politics. The Bush administration was determined to reopen Wall Street at the earliest possible date, and this, of course, meant that someone had to give the “all clear” in lower Manhattan.59 As it happened, this unsavory political chore fell to Bush-appointee John L. Henshaw, Assistant Secretary of Labor for OSHA, who on September 16, 2001 dutifully stepped up to a microphone and announced that the air was safe to breathe. Said Henshaw, “Our tests show that it is safe for New Yorkers to go back to work in New York’s fi nancial district.” 60EPA Director Christie Todd Whitman made similar reassuring statements. There was no reason for reassurance. In fact, the data gathered by Thomas Cahill’s DELTA team showed that the air was most defi nitely not safe to breathe, especially in the vicinity of Ground Zero, and downwind. “By January,” Cahill later told a reporter at UC Davis, “we had some numbers that were really scary.” $\\underline", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:The 9_11 Mystery Plane - Mark H.

Cahill predicted many other health problems down the road, such as ischemic heart disease. According to Cahill, when very fi ne particulates of glass and metal enter the blood through the lungs, they can travel to the heart, where they build up and later cause swelling and weaken the heart muscle. Sufferers eventually die from cardiac arrest. “Almost surely,” said Cahill, “in fi ve to ten years we’ll start to see heart attacks. People in their 40s.” As a result of the EPA’s false assurances, precautionary measures at Ground Zero were lax: Less than a third of the clean-up workers bothered to wear face masks.62 Yet, the DELTA Group’s data indicated that “no one should have been allowed in without a double-canister respirator.” 63Cahill expressed outrage at the level of EPA incompetence, and charged that the Bush administration was responsible. When the EPA showed no interest in the DELTA Group’s fi ndings, the team released its data independently at a February 11, 2002 press conference. Two weeks later, Cahill was summoned to testify at a hearing in Washington, where he again contradicted the EPA. His testimony on this occasion helped spark an internal EPA investigation, which culminated in an August 2003 report by EPA Inspector General Nikki Tinsley, the agency’s in-house watchdog. Tinsley’s report was stunning even by beltway standards. Tinsley conceded that the EPA had no scientifi c basis for issuing the “all clear” fi ve days after the September 11 attack. The inspector also acknowledged that political interference had hobbled the EPA’s response.64 Tinsley revealed that the White House had instructed EPA Director Whitman to clear all EPA press releases with Bush’s National Security Council, which then ordered the EPA to insert phony assurances and omit clearlyworded warnings. The political fallout from this bombshell has yet to subside. In February 2006, U.S. district judge Deborah Batts allowed a class-action lawsuit against the EPA to proceed. The suit had been fi led by attorneys for the victims.65 The judge also blasted the Bush administration for negligence that could ultimately cost thousands of additional lives.

Other suits against the city of New York on behalf of 8,000 recovery workers were also moving through the courts. By November 2006 at least 400 WTC responders had already been diagnosed with various cancers due to exposure to the deadly plume.66 In September 2003 Dr. Cahill presented a detailed paper of the DELTA Group’s fi ndings at a special symposium about 9/11 organized by the American Chemical Society. 67Once again, Cahill contradicted the EPA’s claims about air quality in a strongly-worded press statement that was widely reported in the U.S. media. “Two days later,” Cahill said, “I heard from two independent sources that that press release ended up on George Bush’s desk with a little yellow sticky note on it saying, ‘Look what UC is doing to us.’”68 When I reached Dr. Cahill by telephone early in 2007, he indicated that his team did not know about the molten steel at Ground Zero. Nonetheless, Cahill and the DELTA Group mention the high temperatures in a thorough summary of their research published in 2004. The article states that “infrared surveys showed surface temperatures in the collapse pile were as high as 30 K above ambient in October, and much higher subsurface temperatures were inferred from the lower portions of removed steel beams glowing red” [my emphasis].69 In fact, there is compelling evidence that some of the steel removed from the WTC ruin was much hotter than cherry-red. Color is an accurate gauge of temperature, and at least one photo taken during the WTC cleanup shows a forked claw-lift removing a piece of light-yellow steel, indicating a temperature of at least 1, 900^(∘)F 1, 038^(∘)C) . 70(Observe the bottom edge of the steel in the back cover photo.) From the color-temperature chart it is obvious that this steel is considerably hotter than cherry-red steel, which has a temperature of only about 1, 450^(∘)F Notice that the yellow-colored steel in the photo is also approximately 680^(∘)F hotter than molten aluminum. The photo strongly supports the eyewitness accounts, because if molten steel were present, one would expect to fi nd temperatures in the light-yellow heat range. Indeed, the confi rmed temperature of 1, 900^(∘)F is anomalous in and of itself, because this is well above the uppermost combustion temperature of jet fuel, or for that matter any other fuel known to have been present in the WTC. And, remember, this assumes the most favorable conditions for combustion, which certainly did not exist on September 11, 2001, nor afterward in the rubble pile.

At very least, the photo is powerful evidence for an extreme energy source, as yet unidentifi ed. There is also compelling video evidence that steel did melt. Several remarkable videos of the South Tower, fi lmed just moments before it collapsed, show a large quantity of a bright white-yellow-orange liquid streaming out of the north side of the building on the 80th fl oor.

Nonetheless, in 2006 Dr. Steven E. Jones, then a professor of physics at Brigham Young University, challenged NIST’s assertion that the liquid seen in the video was aluminum.72 Jones pointed out that molten aluminum is characteristically silver in color, not yellow. While it is true that molten aluminum will begin to incandesce, i.e., to glow yellow, if additional heat is applied and its temperature is raised to 1, 832^(∘)F 1, 000^(∘)C) , for all practical purposes this can only be achieved in a laboratory, because as soon as aluminum melts, it begins to fl ow. For this reason a container is required to raise the temperature of liquid aluminum beyond the melting point, and surely there was no such container on 9/11. On melting, the aluminum would simply have fl owed away from the heat source. Moreover, as Jones also pointed out, unlike iron, aluminum has low emissivity and high refl ectivity, meaning that even when heated to an incandescent temperature ( ≈ 1, 832^(∘)F) in a laboratory, it glows", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:The 9_11 Mystery Plane - Mark H.

Moreover, as Jones also pointed out, unlike iron, aluminum has low emissivity and high refl ectivity, meaning that even when heated to an incandescent temperature ( ≈ 1, 832^(∘)F) in a laboratory, it glows only faintly yellow — not brightly as in the photo. NIST attempted to get around these problems by arguing that the molten aluminum was “very likely mixed with large amounts of hot, partially burned, solid organic materials (e.g., furniture, carpets, partitions and computers) which can display an orange glow, much like logs burning in a fi replace.” 73But NIST produced no empirical data to back up its claim. Evidently, NIST conducted no experiments on this, despite a $15 million research budget. The unsubstantiated claim aroused the curiosity of Dr. Jones, who together with several colleagues decided to test NIST’s conclusion experimentally by adding these same organic materials to molten aluminum. When they did this in a laboratory, however, they found no change in the silver color. 74The organic materials did not readily mix with the aluminum, nor did the combination produce a bright orange or yellow color. Jones concluded that the metallic liquid seen fl owing out of the South Tower on 9/11 was probably molten iron which had originated from the WTC steel. In his view, the evidence pointed to the use of a high temperature explosive such as thermite. It is curious in this regard that when cleanup crews reached the bottom of the WTC pit, they made a surprising discovery, and one that supports Jones. The crews found large irregular masses of solidifi ed slag. The lumps resembled meteorites and were in fact conglomerates of fused iron and other metals, with extruding pieces of pipe, steel and embedded chunks of concrete — further evidence that something had melted steel. 1. This work was performed by Jonathan Barnett and two other materials scientists from Worcester Polytechnic Institute. As noted earlier, this paper was included as an appendix to the FEMA report. 75The scientists discovered that something had eroded one-inch thick fl anges to half of their original thickness.

They concluded that at temperatures of about 1, 800^(∘)F. “a liquid eutectic mixture containing iron, oxygen, and sulfur formed during this hot corrosion attack upon the steel.” Notice, this temperature is far below the melting point of iron. The scientists were in fact describing a well-known physical phenomenon: a eutectic mixture, in which the presence of one element (here, sulfur), has the effect of signifi cantly lowering the melting point of another (in this case, iron). Barnett and his colleagues were shocked and baffl ed by the evidence, which they described as “very unusual.” Notably, they could not explain how elemental sulfur and iron came to be mixed. This was a puzzler because structural steel has almost no sulfur content. The scientists acknowledged the possibility that “the phenomenon started prior to collapse and accelerated the weakening of the steel structure.” Even as other FEMA experts explored a number of fi re-induced collapse scenarios for WTC-7, Barnett told the New York Times that the explanations being considered “… would not explain steel members in the debris pile that appear to have been partly evaporated in extraordinarily high temperatures.” The Times called the fi ndings “perhaps the deepest mystery uncovered in the investigation.”77 In a stunning development, new evidence emerged in 2007 that may explain all of the above phenomena and could be the smoking gun from the collapsed World Trade Center. Dr. Steven Jones, whom I’ve already introduced, presented this new evidence in June during a riveting lecture and slide show at a 9/11 truth conference in Vancouver, Canada. 78The evidence emerged in the course of studying the WTC dust, a sample of which Jones obtained from Janette MacKinlay, a New York City resident at the time of the 9/11 attack. MacKinlay’s fourth fl oor apartment, located at 113 Cedar St. in Manhattan, was about 100 meters from the South Tower. She was away on September 11. However, when MacKinlay returned home a week later, she found her apartment fi lled with dust from the WTC. During the collapse it had fl ooded in through broken windows. MacKinlay preserved some of this dust in a plastic bag and, much later, sent the sample to Dr. Jones when she learned about his research. Jones also obtained a second dust sample from a Ph.D. scientist, who collected it from an interior window sill inside the Potter Building, located at 38 Park Row. This is about four blocks from Ground Zero. The sample was collected on September 14, 2001, just three days after the attack, as rescue operations were still underway, and before any major steel-cutting operations had begun.79", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:The 9_11 Mystery Plane - Mark H.

The sample was collected on September 14, 2001, just three days after the attack, as rescue operations were still underway, and before any major steel-cutting operations had begun.79 These samples were a lucky break, as they allowed Jones to study unaltered evidence from the WTC collapse. Jones soon discovered that the dust in both was rich in tiny metallic particles, which he extracted for laboratory analysis from the bulk sample using a simple magnet. When he studied the metallic particles, fi rst under an optical microscope, then using an electron microscope, he found the same micro spheres previously reported in other studies of the WTC dust, including one by the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS). 80The spheres ranged in size from 1 micron to 1.5mm . When Jones analyzed the metallic spheres using X-ray energy dispersive spectroscopy, he confi rmed the USGS fi nding that the spheres were mostly iron, the primary constituent of steel. Some of the spheres were hollow, and their shape was clearly the result of surface tension, indicating that the iron had been in a molten state. But what energy source was responsible? As I have noted, the melting point of iron is 2, 800^(∘)F , far above the highest combustion temperature of jet fuel or any other fuel present in the WTC. Further analysis revealed the likely answer. The same spectrograph also confi rmed the presence of sulfur, aluminum, and copper, which Jones immediately recognized as signifi cant, because this combination of elements happens to be the signature residue of thermate, a well-known high temperature explosive originally developed by the U.S. military. Thermate is an analogue of thermite, the use of which Jones had already suspected. Here, fi nally, was hard evidence in the form of residues. Thermate differs from its cousin thermite in that it contains elemental sulfur, which has the effect of greatly lowering the melting point of iron to about 1, 724^(∘)F (940^(∘)C) . Thermite is occasionally used in demolition work to cut heavy steel beams, which it does very effi ciently. Sulfur is sometimes added to speed up the reaction. The formula for thermate is relatively simple: fi ne aluminum powder is mixed with metal oxides (e.g., iron oxide and copper oxide) and elemental sulfur. Ignition triggers a violent reaction that reaches temperatures of $ 4 { , } 5 0 0 ^ { } .$ producing aluminum oxide (a white smoke) and large amounts of molten iron laced with sulfur.81 For a control, Jones staged a small-scale laboratory test, in which he used thermate to cut a steel bar", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:The 9_11 Mystery Plane - Mark H.

The reaction produced a shower of sparks, another characteristic of this high-temperature explosive. The sparks were, in fact, tiny droplets of iron that condensed and hardened into tiny spherules, which Jones then gathered up for comparative analysis. When he studied them with an electron microscope, he found they were identical to those in the WTC dust. The resulting spectrograph was also a near-perfect match, showing the characteristic peaks in the same relative abundance. The chemical formula for thermate is somewhat variable, for which reason Jones had to estimate the relative proportions of the ingredients. Nonetheless, the match was very close. In a separate study, Jones also analyzed a sample taken from the interior of a lump of slag pulled from the bottom of the WTC bathtub (the foundation hole). Here, again, he confi rmed the presence of elemental sulfur. The use of thermate would explain the sulfur residues in the slag, and on the steel fl ange, cited earlier, as well as the erosion of the steel described by the scientists from Worcester Polytechnic. The use of thermate would also explain why various photos and videos of the WTC collapse show thick white smoke trailing from steel beams. The white smoke seen in the photos may well have been aluminum oxide. The use of thermate would also easily account for the yelloworange molten metal seen pouring out of the South Tower moments before it collapsed.82 As I’ve noted, a eutectic mix including sulfur could explain why the iron remained in a molten state, even though well below the melting point indicated by the color-temperature chart. Use of thermate could even account for another 9/11 mystery which has never been explained, namely, the extensive corrosive effects observed on many automobiles parked in the vicinity of the WTC. The corrosion was especially pronounced on the car roofs. In many cases the interiors were unaffected. 83Obviously, whatever caused the corrosion showered down upon the cars from above. For sake of comparison, Jones also analyzed a dust sample from the Stardust Hotel in Las Vegas, which was professionally demolished on March 13, 2007 using C-4, a different type of high-temperature explosive. The sample was gathered by 9/11 truth activists who were present to witness the destruction of the famous hotel. When analyzed, the Stardust sample was likewise found to contain iron-rich spheres.

However, there were no residues of sulfur or aluminum, both of which are diagnostic for thermate. While the constituents of aluminothermic (i.e., thermite) explosives can vary — a number of different metal oxides can be used, including zinc oxide, zinc nitrate, potassium permanganate, and barium nitrate — nonetheless, according to Jones, the use of X-ray spectroscopy allows the metallic ingredients and elemental sulfur to be identifi ed with considerable accuracy. Jones emphasizes that for this reason “the presence of the aluminothermic reaction signature is quite unambiguous.”84 As we are about to discover, his fi ndings do not stand alone. In April 2002, lawyers representing Deutsche Bank retained the R.J. Lee Group, a private consulting fi rm, to oversee several studies of the effects of 9/11 on the Bankers Trust Building in lower Manhattan. Located at 130 Liberty Street, across the street from WTC 2, the building suffered considerable damage on 9/11 as well as toxic contamination. After hiring an engineering fi rm to assess the structural damage, Deutsche Bank brought in the R.J. Lee Group to determine whether an environmental cleanup of the building was even feasible. The result was the most extensive microscopic investigation of WTC dust yet performed. All told, R.J. Lee scientists examined some 400,000 dust particles.85 In its December 2003 report, R.J. Lee noted that the WTC dust was very different from the background dust normally found in offi ce buildings. The WTC dust possessed “a unique set of characteristics,” which R.J. Lee thoroughly documented and catalogued. The particles of asbestos, plastic, gypsum, metal, and glass showed abundant evidence of having been formed in the presence of high temperatures. Some of the particles were vesicular in shape, with “a round open porous structure” and a “Swiss cheese appearance as a result of boiling and evaporation,” 86language reminiscent of the Worcester Polytechnic paper. R.J. Lee also found that “various metals (most notably iron and lead) were melted during the WTC event, producing spherical metallic particles.”87 These included the same iron-rich spheres fi rst identifi ed by the USGS, and later by Jones. R.J. Lee’s spectrographs of the hardened droplets (using the X-ray dispersive method) were also identical, and confi rm the presence of the same elements found by Jones. $\\underline { { 8 8 } } \\mathbf { R } \\mathbf { J }$ .

Lee attributed all of the heat-altered characteristics to the WTC confl agration. R.J. Lee also found an abundance of mineral wool fi bers in the dust, which is not surprising since mineral wool is a common insulation material and was used extensively in the WTC. The wool fi bers had also been heat-altered, but one fi nding was of paramount interest. Amazingly, many of the fi bers had a thin coating of lead-oxide, which indicated that the lead not only melted, but had been volatized. In short, the lead had reached the boiling point, i.e., 3, 180^(∘)F ( 1, 749^(∘)C) before vaporizing, after which it had condensed onto the surface of the wool fi bers. Once again, R.J. Lee attributed these most unusual effects to the heat of the WTC confl agration. Dr. Jones reviewed all of these fi ndings in his June 2007 presentation, but took strong issue with R.J. Lee’s conclusion that the WTC fi re had produced the iron-rich spheres and the lead-coated fi bers. 89This was clearly impossible, because, as noted, offi ce fi res do not reach temperatures suffi cient to melt iron, and come no where near the much higher boiling point of lead (3, 180^(∘)F or 1, 749^(∘)C) . The NIST report admits that the WTC fi res never exceeded 1, 800^(∘)F (1, 000^(∘)C) ,90 which is far far below either of these temperatures. Here, then, was more compelling evidence for an extreme energy source on 9/11. As noted, thermate reaches temperatures of $ 4 { , } 5 0 0 ^ { } $ , easily hot enough to account for all of these effects. In a separate line of research, Jones and his colleagues obtained unpublished spectrographic data from the USGS WTC dust study by means of a Freedom of Information Act request — and promptly made another important discovery. The unpublished data showed that the USGS had also found a tiny molybdenum-rich spherule, which had not previously been reported. This was extremely signifi cant because molybdenum is a very hard metal, with an extremely high melting point: 4, 753^(∘)F (2, 623^(∘)C) . The presence of this spherule indicates that something melted molybdenum on 9/11. Yet, how was this possible, since jet fuel and the other known combustibles in the WTC burn nowhere near this temperature? Here was yet more evidence for an extreme energy source.91 In his Vancouver lecture Dr. Jones made a fi nal telling point: After crimes involving fi res and explosions, it is standard forensic procedure to test", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:The 9_11 Mystery Plane - Mark H.

Here was yet more evidence for an extreme energy source.91 In his Vancouver lecture Dr. Jones made a fi nal telling point: After crimes involving fi res and explosions, it is standard forensic procedure to test for residues of high-temperature explosives.92 Obviously, such tests should have been conducted after 9/11, which involved not only a major fi re, but the most serious “terrorist attack” in U.S. history. Not only were there many eyewitness accounts of explosions (which I will discuss in the next chapter), in addition, as noted, one preliminary study by Jonathan Barnett and colleagues had already reported the erosion of steel and the presence of sulfur, both of which are most unusual and point to the likely use of explosives. Their fi ndings were suspicious and, at very least, called for further research. Yet, by its own admission, NIST took a pass and failed to look for residues. 93The agency attempted to justify its decision to skip this important follow-up work by claiming that the use of thermate to demolish the WTC was implausible, since many thousands of pounds of the high-temperature explosive would have been required — a claim sharply disputed by Dr. Jones, who estimates that around 1,000 pounds of thermate would have suffi ced to demolish each tower.94 NIST’s failure to test the WTC steel for residues of explosives was a grave omission, and one that undermines its conclusion that the WTC collapse was a global structural failure induced by the jet impacts and subsequent fi res. The above evidence points to a very different conclusion, one with extremely serious implications for our nation. Perhaps this is why hundreds of professional architects and engineers have already signed a petition calling for a new and genuine investigation of the WTC collapse on 9/11.95 12 The interview was part of a live debate with physicist Steven Jones, which aired on KGNU Radio, Denver, Colorado, on October 26, 2006.

When NIST fi nally released its report in September 2005, numerous critics charged that the agency had ignored evidence of explosions in the World Trade Center, including the testimony of many eyewitnesses. NIST responded by asserting its scientifi c laurels. The agency insisted that its “200 technical experts” had conducted “an extremely thorough investigation.” NIST boasted that its staff “reviewed tens of thousands of documents, interviewed more than 1,000 people, reviewed 7,000 segments of video footage and 7,000 photographs, analyzed 236 pieces of steel from the wreckage, performed laboratory tests and sophisticated computer simulations,” yet found “no corroborating evidence for a controlled demolition.” NIST also claimed that it had considered “a number of hypotheses for the collapse of the towers.”3 Many Americans were persuaded by this snow job. Sad to say, few of our countrymen (or women) bother to read offi cial reports, especially when they run to 10,000 pages. This has been a problem since at least the time of the Warren Commission report. The persistent individuals who do read reports, however, know that there are sound reasons to question all of the above, because a close reading of the NIST report shows that the agency assumed from the beginning that the Boeing 767 impacts and subsequent fi res were responsible for the collapse of the twin towers. The report gives no consideration whatsoever to alternative hypotheses, including the leading candidate: explosives. Far from exploring other scenarios, NIST simply took it for granted that the impacts set in motion a chain of events leading to a catastrophic structural failure. Working backwards, NIST scientists searched for evidence that supported their predetermined conclusion. Everything else was ignored or excluded. If it is not already evident to the reader, this is no way to conduct a scientifi c investigation.

NIST then had the audacity to imply that it arrived at its favored collapse model through an exhaustive process of elimination. The tragic consequences of the September 11, 2001 attacks were directly attributable to the fact that terrorists fl ew large jet-fuel laden commercial airliners into the WTC towers. Buildings for use by the general population are not designed to withstand attacks of such severity; building codes do not require building designs to consider aircraft impact.4 The comment about building codes is deceptive, because NIST readily concedes in its report that the towers survived the initial impacts. In fact, John Skilling, the structural engineer who designed the WTC, always claimed that they would. The towers survived, despite serious damage, because they were hugely overbuilt, redundant by design. Although the WTC’s soaring lines gave the impression of a relatively light frame, in fact, the twin towers were extremely rugged buildings, engineered to withstand hurricane-force winds and even a direct hit by a Boeing 707, the largest commercial jetliner of the day. Some have argued that the newer Boeing 767s caused much more damage because of their larger size, but in fact, the two Boeings are comparable. Although slightly smaller, the 707 has a greater cruise speed of 600 mph (as compared with 530 mph for a Boeing 767). Assuming both were to crash at their cruising speed, the 707 would actually have greater kinetic energy.5 After the impacts on 9/11, the severed steel columns simply transferred the weight of the building to other undamaged columns. The NIST report even states that the towers would probably have stood indefi nitely, if the impacts had not dislodged the fi reproofi ng material that protected the steel from fi regenerated heat.6 Construction-grade steel begins to lose strength at 425^(∘)C ( ≈ 800^(∘)F) and is only about half as strong at 650^(∘)C (1, 202^(∘)F) . NIST argues in its report that the crashed jetliners damaged or dislodged 100% of the protective insulation within the impact zone, while also spilling many thousands of gallons of jet fuel over multiple fl oors. The resulting 800 − 1, 000^(∘)C (1, 440–1, 800^(∘)F ) blaze — the report claims — seriously weakened the nowexposed steel, leading to a global structural failure. In order to understand the offi cial story, however, and to appreciate why it fails to explain the WTC collapse, it is necessary to know more about the World Trade Center and how it was built. Apon its completion in 1970, the North Tower of the Trade Center soared 1,368 feet — 100 feet higher than the Empire State Building.

Apon its completion in 1970, the North Tower of the Trade Center soared 1,368 feet — 100 feet higher than the Empire State Building. In addition to being the world’s tallest skyscraper, it was a state-of-the-art achievement of high-rise construction. 7Designed by architect Minoru Yamasaki, the WTC was one of the fi rst skyscrapers to feature large expanses of unobstructed fl oor space within a steel-frame building. Although commonplace today, this was a novel idea in the 1960s, as it required doing away with the forest of columns so typical of the skyscrapers of former years. Chief engineer John Skilling achieved the objective of open space with a double support system: the fi rst tubular design, consisting of a dense array of 240 columns around the outer wall or perimeter, and a network of 47 huge columns at the core. The core columns supported about 53% of the weight of each building, and were massive, up to 52 inches wide.8 The steel in these monster columns was seven inches thick at the base.9 The core columns were of two types: box columns at the foot of the buildings, gradually transitioning to rolled wide-fl ange beams (“I” beams) higher up. The core of each tower, including the elevators and stairwells, was surrounded by expansive offi ce space. The perimeter wall supported 47% of the weight and also resisted the force of the wind. These exterior columns were reinforced with broad steel plates known as “spandrels,” which girdled the building, like ribs, at every fl oor. Although the core columns gradually increased in size from top to bottom, for aesthetic reasons the external dimensions of the perimeter columns had to be the same all the way down, hence, required the use of heat-treated, i.e., high-strength, steel. This explains why Skilling’s new tubular concept only became feasible in the 1960s, when high-strength steels fi rst became available. Prefabrication and a modular design were other innovations that kept costs down and allowed for speedy construction. Both inner and outer sets of columns were joined together by an innovative system of lightweight steel trusses. Each fl oor consisted of a truss assembly, over which was laid a corrugated steel deck — the bed for a poured four-inch slab of concrete.

Although lightweight, the fl oor design was so sound that it easily supported the weight of libraries, fi le rooms, and heavy safes without the need for additional supports. 10The light-weight truss assemblies were vulnerable to fi re damage, however, because they consisted of rather thin steel members. For this reason, at the time of construction the trusses were spraycoated with protective insulation, 0.75 inch thick, and this was later upgraded to an average thickness of more than two inches.11 (The technical term for the insulation is Spray-applied Fire Resistant Material: SFRM) The core columns had a fi re-barrier of gypsum wallboard. NIST argues in its report that the Boeing impacts jarred loose this protective insulation from the steel trusses and columns. The subsequent fi res then weakened the exposed trusses, causing them to sag. This, in turn, pulled the perimeter columns inward. The fi res also weakened both sets of columns, and at a critical point the perimeter wall buckled. NIST makes the claim that its investigation showed conclusively that the initiation occurred in the perimeter wall, triggering a global collapse.12 Did the agency prove its case? Before I explore this question, however, it is important to understand what NIST did not investigate. Despite its broad charge to investigate the WTC collapse, NIST limited the scope of its investigation to the sequence of events from the fi rst plane impacts to the onset of collapse. This means, of course, that NIST did not study the collapse itself. This narrow focus — some would call it sleight-of-hand — allowed NIST to sidestep a number of crucial issues. This was no doubt the intent, since investigating them would surely have led NIST scientists to some very different conclusions. The fi rst and foremost of these was the near-free-fall speed of the collapse. Videos fi lmed on 9/11 confi rm that the towers plummeted as if there was almost no resistance whatsoever. But how can this be, given the enormous inertial mass of the building itself, which should have resisted and slowed the fall considerably? Even if we assume that the columns in the impact zone failed, the rest of the columns in the towers were untouched by the plane impacts and fi res, suffering no loss of strength. These stone-cold columns should have resisted the fall. Although the exact timing of the collapse of WTC 1 and 2 cannot be determined with precision because of the growing dust cloud, each collapse took approximately 10-12 seconds, only 1-2 seconds slower than the time for a billiard ball to free-fall from the WTC roof to the plaza below.

But how can this be? By what special dispensation did the collapsing WTC violate the laws of physics? The reader will search the NIST report in vain for any discussion of this key anomaly. Why not? Obviously, because agency offi cials made a political decision not to go there. No less puzzling was the fact that the collapses were total and nearly symmetrical. This means, of course, that when the collapses began all of the columns on that fl oor failed at precisely the same moment. But, again, how could this happen? Even if we assume that the plane impacts severed or damaged a number of columns in the impact zone, and even if we also assume that the fi res weakened a number of other nearby columns, the majority of columns in the buildings and even on the affected fl oors were still at full strength at the moment of collapse. Yet, the collapses were total. The rubble from the buildings fell through the plaza level and piled up in the basements. Photos by Joel Meyerowitz and others show that the piles of wreckage were about six stories high, as evidenced by surviving portions of the perimeter wall. The wreckage reached the level of the column tree — a convenient reference point — where the larger exterior columns around the base divided into three smaller columns above. The totality of the collapse is hard to explain because, as noted, the largest and strongest columns were in the lower part of the buildings. As they fell, the towers encountered increasing mass, i.e., resistance. For this reason, at least one engineer has argued that the WTC collapse should at some point have selfarrested. 13This, however, has been disputed, and the matter remains controversial.14 9/11 documentary on the History Channel, for example, a debunker glibly described the events at Ground Zero as a “classic progressive collapse,” as if this were a well-known or frequent phenomenon.15 But this is plainly false, since — and I must emphasize it again — no steel-frame skyscraper had ever collapsed before 9/11, nor has any since. There is an excellent reason why they do not fall down.

Nor would they have ordered hundreds of New York City fi remen to begin the long climb up the stairwells to aid the victims and assist with the evacuation. As we know, 343 fi remen perished. According to the offi cial report, at least one fi re chief did express concern about the danger of a partial collapse on the upper fl oors. $\\underline { { 1 7 } } \\mathrm { N o }$ doubt, this individual was as shocked as everyone else by the totality and near-perfect symmetry of the ensuing collapses — both standard features of controlled demolitions and virtually unknown in random fi re events. After I posted a critique of the NIST report in December 2006, I received a letter from a retired fi reman who informed me that over the course of his twenty-odd years of service he had fought many types of fi res, involving residential, commercial and industrial structures, including high-rise buildings. He explained that on a number of occasions, when his crew lost the battle to save a structure, “some of the times the building would collapse … in a random, haphazard, piecemeal fashion. Not once, did I personally witness one of those structures collapsing in the rather controlled … fashion as the WTC towers and Building 7.”18 Another anomaly was the pulverization of material. Throughout history, concrete buildings have been known to collapse during powerful earthquakes, and when this occurs they typically fold up like an accordion, leaving a succession of concrete slabs, one piled on top of another, each plainly discernible in the rubble. But nothing like this occurred on 9/11. Photos of the mountain of wreckage at Ground Zero taken by Joel Meyerowitz and others show very few, if any, large chunks of concrete. The rubble pile consisted almost exclusively of twisted steel. The conspicuous absence of concrete is remarkable, since concrete was the main constituent of the 500,000-ton towers. As noted, each fl oor of the 110-story building, roughly an acre in size, consisted of a slab of poured concrete, most of which was pulverized during the collapse into small pieces and fi ne dust.

Some have attributed this to the force of gravity, but videos of the collapse clearly dispute this. The buildings were not pulverized as they hit the ground; they disintegrated in midair. As the South Tower started to collapse, for example, the entire upper section tipped as a unit, then inexplicably turned to dust before our eyes. As noted, much of the dust settled a foot deep on the sixteen-acre WTC site. The rest was deposited across lower Manhattan. Nor was the pulverization limited to concrete. Other construction materials also disappeared without a trace, including glass, offi ce furniture, and tens of thousands of computers, not to mention the many victims. It’s a fact that fewer than 300 corpses were recovered. Most of the victims were identifi ed solely from body parts. Strangely, when workmen began to dismantle the badly damaged Deutsch Bank on December 8, 2006, they found more than 700 slivers of bone on the roof and within the structure. 19This bizarre report has never been explained. (Incidentally, the E.J. Lee study determined that the building was beyond saving and recommended demolition.) And there were other anomalies. The video record plainly shows that during the WTC collapse, perimeter columns weighing many tons were hurled as far as 500-600 feet from the towers. One remarkable photo of Ground Zero taken from above shows that entire sections of WTC-1’s western perimeter wall were thrown over 500 feet toward the Winter Garden. 20Could a gravitational collapse do this? Doubtful. The NIST report not only fails to adequately address any of these issues, it doesn’t even try. The report makes reference to the “global collapse” of the towers, but we never learn precisely what this means because NIST never informs us. By sharply limiting the scope of its inquiry ahead of time, NIST rendered the truth unobtainable — an effective way to neuter an investigation. With all of this in mind, let us now explore what NIST did investigate. The NIST investigation was comprised of eight separate projects, which together produced 43 volumes of supporting documentation. The projects included metallurgical studies, an impact analysis, an attempt to reconstruct the fi res, and a computer model of the probable sequence of events leading to the collapse of each tower. Some of the agency’s research was of excellent quality — some was not. But the main problem is that none of it lends credence to NIST’s offi cial conclusions.

Without question, the most serious obstacle NIST investigators faced was a lack of information about the dynamic conditions that existed in the core of the towers on 9/11. 21To be sure, thousands of photographs and hundreds of hours of videotape made it possible to study in detail the damage to the WTC exterior, and to gain a reasonable understanding about conditions in the outer offi ces. Fires were often visible through the windows despite dense smoke, and structural damage in the impact zone, such as collapsed fl oors, was also discernible. However, as the NIST report states, “Fires deeper than a few meters inside the building could not be seen because of the smoke obscuration [sic] and the steep viewing angle of nearly all the photographs.” 22This is an important admission, and one that NIST repeats a number of times. For example, in one of the supplementary documents, NIST scientists qualify their analysis of the effects of the fi re upon the steel with the following caveat: As we will see, this candid statement haunts the entire report. In fact, the only physical evidence NIST had about the actual conditions at the core was the data it was able to glean from 236 steel columns, panels, trusses, and other smaller samples recovered from the WTC ruin.24 Metallurgical testing of these steel samples was probably the most important work NIST carried out, because this was the foundation for the rest of the investigation. Although the collection represented only 0.25 - 0.5 % of the 180,000 total tons of structural steel used in the two towers, NIST scientists believed their sampling was adequate to determine the quality of the steel and to evaluate its performance on 911. 26The metallurgical fi ndings decisively refuted the pancake theory of collapse widely reported in the media after 9/11. The pancake enthusiasts, including MIT engineer Thomas Eagar, whom I have already cited, had argued that the weak link in the WTC was the point of attachment where the trusses connected with the inner and outer columns. These junctions, referred to as angle-clips, were made of relatively lightweight steel and were secured by steel bolts. During a 2002 NOVA television special, Eagar explained the pancake model and why in his opinion the trusses had failed: … the steel had plenty of strength, until it reached temperatures of 1, 100^(∘) to 1, 300^(∘)F In this range, the steel started losing a lot of strength, and the bending became greater.

Eventually the steel lost 80 percent of its strength, because of this fi re that consumed the whole fl oor … then you got this domino effect. Once you started to get angle-clips to fail in one area, it put extra load on other angle-clips, and then it unzipped around the building on that fl oor in a matter of seconds. If you look at the whole structure, they are the smallest piece of steel. As everything begins to distort, the smallest piece is going to become the weak link in the chain. They were plenty strong for holding up one truss, but when you lost several trusses, the trusses adjacent to those had to hold two or three times what they were expected to hold.27 According to the pancake theory, when one fl oor collapsed it set in motion a chain reaction. Although initially this seemed plausible, it turned out that Eager seriously underestimated the robustness of the World Trade Center. The earlier 2002 FEMA study found no indication of substandard materials or construction. On the contrary, FEMA found that “many structural and fi re protection features of the design and construction were … superior to the minimum code requirements. ?28 The NIST investigation bore this out. For example, NIST confi rmed that the truss assemblies were not only bolted to the outer perimeter wall, they were also welded, hence were considerably stronger than expected — not prone to pancaking. ${ \\underline { { 2 9 } } } \\mathbf { N o r }$ could the pancake model explain the failure of the core columns. The steel in the WTC also turned out to be signifi cantly stronger than expected. Tests showed the yield-strengths of 87% of the steel samples exceeded the original specifi cations. For instance, the perimeter columns exceeded their specifi cations by more than 10% . The strength of the steel in the truss assemblies was also signifi cantly higher than required.

One need not be a rocket scientist to see that the stronger the steel, the less likely it was to fail on 9/11. 168 In a series of fi re tests, NIST sought to address the alleged weakening of the WTC support columns. During a fi rst-run, investigators placed an uninsulated steel column in a furnace where temperatures reached 1, 100^(∘)C (2, 012^(∘)F) . During the test the surface temperature of the exposed column reached 600^(∘)C in just 13 minutes — the temperature range where signifi cant loss of strength occurs. When the test was repeated with a column treated with SFRM insulation, the steel did not reach 600^(∘)C even after ten hours. NIST concluded that “the fi res in WTC-1 and WTC-2 would not be able to signifi cantly weaken … insulated … columns within the 102 minutes and 56 minutes, respectively, after impact and prior to collapse.”32 NIST scientists developed a novel way to evaluate the impact of the fi re on the WTC steel. According to the report, the approach was “easy to implement and robust enough to examine the entire component in the fi eld.” 33They found that the original primer paint used on the steel beams and columns was altered by high heat. This made it possible to determine the level of exposure by analyzing the paint on the samples.34 But the results were surprising. NIST found no evidence that any of the steel samples, including those from the impact areas and fi re-damaged fl oors, had reached temperatures exceeding 1, 110^(∘)F (600^(∘)C) . 35Sixteen recovered perimeter columns showed evidence of having been exposed to fi re, but even so, out of 170 areas examined on these columns only three locations had reached temperatures in excess of 250^(∘)C (450^(∘)F) .36 Moreover, NIST found no evidence that any of the recovered core columns had reached even this minimal temperature. 37The startling fact is that NIST’s own data failed to support its conclusion that the fi res of 9/11 heated the steel columns suffi ciently to cause them to weaken and buckle. How might we explain this absence of evidence?

Shyam Sunder, NIST’s lead scientist, probably offered a partial answer when he admitted that “the jet fuel … burned out in less than ten minutes.”38 Also, the actual amount of combustibles in the WTC turned out to be less than expected — considerably less. In its 2002 report, FEMA had noted, … fuel loads in offi ce-type occupancies typically range from about 4-12 psf [pounds per square foot], with the mean slightly less than 8 psf .… At the burning rate necessary to yield these fi res, a fuel load of about 5 psf would be required to maintain the fi re at full force for an hour …39 Yet, when NIST scientists crunched the numbers, they found that a typical fl oor of the WTC did not even have this minimum level of combustibles. The average was only about 4 psf. 40The shocking fact is that the twin towers were fuel-poor compared with other offi ce buildings: a fi nding, notice, that does not support the frequent depictions in the media of a ferocious inferno raging beyond anything in human experience. More importantly, neither does it support NIST’s favored collapse scenario. Yes, the spillage of jet fuel ignited the combustibles, spreading the fi res at a faster rate than would otherwise have occurred. Yet, for this same reason the fi res also burned out sooner, because the fuel load was so low to begin with. Indeed, NIST scientists estimated that, on average, the WTC fi res burned through the available combustibles at maximum temperatures (1, 000^(∘)C) in only about 15-20 minutes, 41after which, the fi res began to subside. To make matters worse for the offi cial collapse theory, NIST also found that “the fuel loading in the core areas … was negligible.”42 It’s easy to understand why all of these facts are downplayed in the NIST report. Taken together, they are fatal to NIST’s collapse model, which requires that high temperatures be sustained. Fires that subside after only 15-20 minutes simply cannot weaken enormous steel columns and cause them to buckle. I searched the NIST report in vain for any acknowledgment that the fi re conditions in the laboratory test furnace were substantially different from the actual conditions on 9/11. Yet, this fact is undeniable, and calls into sharp question NIST’s conclusion that damaged SFRM insulation was the critical factor.

As I’ve noted, NIST suffered from a persistent lack of information about the actual conditions in the core of the towers. Surely, it is safe to conclude that the crashed Boeing 767s damaged and/or stripped away a substantial portion of the protective SFRM insulation from the steel beams and trusses in the impact zone. Exactly how much is not knowable. NIST acknowledges in its report that it had no hard evidence about the amount of protective insulation damaged or dislodged during the impacts. 44Incredibly, however, the agency then asserts that all structural members in the debris path at the time of impact suffered 100% loss of insulation.45 The only physical evidence NIST presents in support of this dubious conclusion is a series of photos of the exterior of the towers. The photos do show that within the impact zone much of the SFRM foam insulation is indeed missing from the perimeter columns. $\\underline { { 4 6 } } \\mathrm { I n }$ places the original antirust paint is clearly visible on the exposed columns, indicating that the insulation is gone from these areas. NIST is also probably correct that the loss occurred during the impacts. But it does not follow on this basis that all of the insulation in the impact zone was similarly lost. In fact, not only does the photographic evidence in the report not prove this, the photos show decisively that at least some of the insulation remained in place. NIST even acknowledges this in its discussion of the photos. For example, the report states that one photo “shows the absence of at least some, if not most SFRM from the center region of the outer web of the column.” Here, “the absence of at least some” of the insulation can only mean that some of it also remained in place. The next passage goes on to describe one column in the same area on which the SFRM was “nearly intact.” $\\underline { { 4 7 } } \\mathrm { { I n } }$ another section the report explicitly mentions that some of the insulation had apparently been treated with a special sealant, which “prevented the loss of SFRM in a great many locations where the SFRM was knocked off both above and below this location.”48 In short, NIST fl atly contradicts itself regarding the disposition of the SFRM; and this is of crucial importance, because it means NIST’s own data fail to support its conclusion.

For the sake of argument, however, let us for the moment ignore this glaring problem and assume that NIST’s estimated total loss of SFRM is correct. As I will now show, even in this worst-case scenario there is virtually no chance that the fi res on 9/11 weakened the WTC’s core and perimeter columns within the allotted span of time. The reason is acknowledged nowhere in the NIST report, but ought to be self-evident. The WTC’s support columns did not exist in isolation. The WTC was no laboratory furnace. The columns in each tower were part of an interconnected steel framework that weighed some 90,000 tons; and because steel is known to be at least a fair conductor of heat, on 9/11 this massive steel superstructure surely functioned as an enormous energy sink. The total volume of the steel framework was vast compared with the relatively small area of exposed steel, and would have wicked away much of the fi re-generated heat. Anyone who has repaired a copper water pipe with a propane torch is familiar with the principle. One must sit and wait patiently for the pipe temperature to rise to the point where the copper fi nally draws the solder into the fi tting. While it is true that copper is several times more heat-conductive than steel, the fact that only three steel samples showed exposure to temperatures above 250^(∘)C indicates that the steel superstructure was indeed behaving as a heat sink. The fi res on 9/11 would have required many hours, in any event much longer than the relatively brief allotted span of 56/102 minutes respectively, to slowly raise the temperature of each steel framework as a whole to the point of weakening even a few exposed members. And there are other problems. Since in a global collapse all of the columns by defi nition must fail at once, this implies a more or less constant blaze across a wide area. But such was not the case on 9/11. As I’ve already noted, NIST found that the unexpectedly light fuel load in any given area of the WTC was mostly consumed in 15-20 minutes. At no time on 9/11 did the fi res rage through an entire fl oor of the WTC — as Thomas Eagar implied in his interview. This was especially true in WTC-1.

But notice what this also means: As the fi res moved away from the impact zone into areas with little or no damage to the SFRM fi reproofi ng, the heating of the steel columns and trusses in those areas would have been inconsequential. NIST’s own data showed that, overall, the fi res on fl oor 96 — where the collapse supposedly began — reached a peak 30-45 minutes after the impact and waned thereafter. Temperatures were actually cooling across most of fl oor 96, including the core, at the moment of the collapse.

Moreover, NIST’s assertion that “temperatures and stresses were high in the core area” is not supported by its fi nding that the fuel load in the core was negligible.51 On this point NIST again contradicts itself. For all of these reasons, NIST fails to explain in its report how transient fi res weakened WTC-1’s enormous core columns and perimeter columns in the allotted span, triggering a global collapse. NIST determined that the fi re behavior in the South Tower was substantially different: more continuous rather than transient, at least on the east side of the building where the remains of Flight 175 supposedly came to rest. This, in addition to more extensive impact damage, NIST informs us, explains why WTC-2 collapsed fi rst, even though it was hit after WTC-1. It is now known, however, that NIST ignored important evidence that calls into question its assertion that fi res were gravely weakening the core of WTC-2.

Palmer and Fire Marshall Ronald P. Bucca, were in excellent physical condition. Palmer was apparently a marathon runner. On reaching the 78th fl oor sky lobby, they found many dead or seriously injured people; but they found no raging inferno. Palmer’s radio exchange with other fi remen shows no hint of panic or fear, as the following transcript shows: Here, Battalion Chief Palmer calls for more men and water to put out the isolated fi res. His expression “10-45 Code Ones” refers to dead bodies, of which apparently there were many. The tape shows that the two fi remen were not turned back by heat, smoke, or a wall of fl ames. They were able to function within the fi re zone and were prepared to help the injured and combat the few isolated fi res they found. Palmer even mentions that the stairway up to the next level, i.e., fl oor 79, was passable. Minutes later the building came down on their heads. NIST knew about this evidence. The NIST report briefl y mentions that fi remen reached the 78th fl oor of WTC-2.53 Inexplicably, however, the matter is simply dropped as if it had no bearing on the status of the fi re in the core.

Yet, NIST ignored it. Why? Well, obviously, because their words do not support the offi cial story. Curiously, the 9/11 Commission Report also briefl y mentions this episode, but likewise fails to discuss its actual signifi cance, no doubt for the same reason.55 According to NIST, the 78th fl oor of WTC-2 had fewer combustibles than other fl oors because it was a sky lobby, and on this basis the report leads us to believe that much more intense fi res were raging several fl oors above the two brave fi remen — fi res that did cause fatal weakening of the columns.

The problem for NIST, however, is that survivors from these higher fl oors tell a very different story. As we know, WTC-2 was unlike WTC-1 in that a number of individuals in the South Tower did manage to escape the impact zone via stairwell A, which luckily remained passable. (In his radio message Orlo Palmer refers to it as “south stairway Adam.”) One of these survivors was Stanley Praimnath, an employee of Fuji Bank who was on the 81st fl oor when Flight 175 crashed into the South Tower. In fact, the wing of the plane reportedly passed within twenty feet of him. Yet, Praimnath escaped without serious burns, and in his testimony mentions nothing about a raging inferno.56 Brian Clark, another survivor, was an executive vice-president of Euro Brokers, based on the 84th fl oor. As Clark descended the stairs, he heard someone crying out for help. It was Praimnath, who at the time was still trapped on the 81st fl oor in the rubble. Clark found and freed the man, whereupon, the two escaped together down the stairs. These two survivors are living proof that the offi cial story cannot be right. Both were in the fi re zone during and immediately after the impact, when the fi res were most intense due to the spilled jet fuel. If the temperatures in the core were 1, 000^(∘)C or higher, as NIST would have us believe, the two men would have died within minutes. Yet, both survived, and here is Clark’s description of the fi re: “You could see through the wall and the cracks and see fl ames just, just licking up, not a roaring inferno, just quiet fl ames licking up and smoke sort of eking through the wall” [my emphasis].57 Quiet fl ames. No roaring inferno. It is not surprising that NIST chose to ignore the testimony of these survivors. So, the known accounts of eyewitnesses do not support the offi cial story regarding conditions at the core of WTC-2 — testimonials that NIST likely excluded from consideration for this very reason. But what about empirical evidence? Among the steel samples that NIST investigators recovered from WTC-2 were two core columns (C-88a and C-88b) from the impact zone. Actually, they were two different members from the same column (801). NIST pinpointed their location on fl oors 80 and 81, several fl oors above the fi remen — very near the path of Flight 175.

Both samples had been physically damaged, yet NIST found no evidence of the kinds of distortion, i.e., buckling, bowing, slumping, or sagging, that would be expected in cases of heatweakened steel. Furthermore, although the samples came from within the fi re zone, NIST was unable to show that the steel had been exposed to high temperatures. 58This fi nding is so astonishing it bears repeating: The NIST report presents no physical evidence whatsoever that the fi res in the core of WTC-2 were raging infernos. On what, then, does the agency base its conclusion: “Dire structural changes were occurring in the building interior”? 59The answer, apparently, is the following strange hedge: Note that these core columns represent less than 1 percent of the core columns on fl oors involved with fi re and cannot be considered representative of any other core columns.60 In other words, we are supposed to accept NIST’s theory about the fi re solely on the basis of its opinion that a larger sampling of columns would have enabled NIST to prove its case. But this is hogwash! It simply is not the way science is done. Indeed, the paucity of evidence, if anything, calls into question NIST’s earlier assertion that its sampling was adequate. What is even more amazing is that NIST’s own computer simulations of the WTC fi res also tend to bear this out. Any curious reader who invests the time to review the relevant NIST document (i.e., CSTAR 1-5) will fi nd page after page of color-coded graphic diagrams of these simulations, one set for each fl oor in the fi re zone. Nearly all of them show that the core remained cool throughout the fi res. The burden of proof was on NIST to demonstrate how the fi res weakened the core columns in the allotted time, and the only reasonable conclusion one can draw is that the agency fails to present even a minimal case. But this also means, of course, that NIST likewise fails to explain the global collapse. For the sake of argument, however, in order to show just how weak the offi cial collapse model is, let us assume that the fi res did burn hot enough and were sustained long enough, and caused numerous exposed columns in the impact zone to lose roughly half of their strength.

As I will now show, even if this did occur, it still fails to account for the global collapse of either tower. The passage informs us that WTC-2 gave no sign of instability after the impact of Flight 175. Unfortunately, although NIST’s summary report provides a wealth of information about how the World Trade Center was constructed, it fails to clarify the matter of the WTC’s “considerable reserve capacity.” At any rate, I scoured the report in vain for a clear discussion of this important issue. In frustration, I fi nally called NIST for assistance and was guided to several of the project reports and supplementary documents. I also consulted with Gary Nichols, an expert at the International Code Council, and with Ron Hamburger, a leading structural engineer. These conversations were an education. I learned that estimating the overall reserve capacity of a steel structure is by no means a simple matter. Numerous factors are involved. Moreover, there are different ways to approach the problem. Perhaps the simplest measure of reserve capacity are the standards for the material components of a building. In the late 1960s when the WTC was constructed, the applicable standard was the New York City Building Code, which required a builder to execute computations for the various structural members to show they met the specifi ed requirements. However, the code also allowed for actual testing of members in the event that computations were impractical. The testing standards applicable in 1968 give a reasonable idea of the required level of reserve strength in the steel columns and other materials used in the WTC. For example, in the most stringent test a steel member had to withstand 250% of the design load, plus half again its own weight, for a period of a week without collapse. 62 Another widely used measure of reserve capacity is the so called “factor of safety.” This varies for different structural elements, but for steel columns and beams typically ranges from 1.75 2.0.63 The NIST report actually breaks down this more general fi gure into two separate and slightly different measurements for stress: yielding strength (1.67) and buckling (1.92).64 For our purposes, however, the more general fi gure is adequate. So, for example, a steel column with a factor of safety of 1.75 must support 1.75 times the anticipated design load before it begins to incur damage. While this value is typical of steel beams in general, the actual reserve strength of the steel columns in the WTC was higher.

While this value is typical of steel beams in general, the actual reserve strength of the steel columns in the WTC was higher. When NIST scientists crunched the numbers for the 47 core columns of WTC-1 (in the impact zone, between the 93rd and 98th fl oors) they calculated that the factor of safety ranged from 1.6 to 2.8, the mean value being 2.1.65 This means that the average core column in the impact zone of WTC-1 could support more than twice its design load before reaching the yield strength, i.e., the point where damage may begin to occur. My grateful thanks to the NIST investigative team for helping me locate these numbers, which were buried in the report. It is important to realize that the factor of safety is not a threshold for collapse, but a value beyond which permanent damage may begin to occur. As the NIST report admits, even “after reaching the yield strength, structural steel components continue to possess considerable reserve capacity.” 66This is why steel beams and columns typically do not fail in sudden fashion. The loss of strength is gradual. No doubt this helps to explain why, although fi res have ravaged many steel frame buildings over history, none had ever collapsed — until 9/11 — nor has any since. With regard to the WTC’s perimeter columns, the factor of safety fl uctuated from day to day and even from hour to hour, because, in addition to supporting 47% of the WTC’s gravity load, the perimeter wall also had to withstand the lateral force of the wind, which is highly variable given the whims of Mother Nature. A single face of the WTC presented an enormous “sail” to the elements, for which reason John Skilling vastly overbuilt this part of the structure. According to the NIST report, the outer wall’s factor of safety against wind shear on September 11, 2001 was extraordinary, i.e., in the 10-11 range.67 Why so high? The answer is simple: On the day of the attack there was essentially no wind, only a slight breeze.68 For this reason nearly all of the perimeter wall’s design capacity was available to help support the gravity load. As the NIST report states, “On September 11, 2001 the wind loads were minimal, thus providing signifi cantly more reserve for the exterior walls.” 69When NIST crunched the numbers for a representative perimeter column in WTC-1 (column 151, between the 93rd and 98th fl oors), they arrived at a factor of safety of 5.7.70 Assuming this average fi gure is a typical value, we arrive at", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:The 9_11 Mystery Plane - Mark H.

Even if we subtract those columns severed or damaged by the impact of Flight 175, and the lost capacity due to the alleged (but unproven) buckling along the eastern perimeter wall, there was still a wide margin of safety, more than enough by several times over to support the outer wall’s share of the gravity load, with plenty to spare.71 I must emphasize: These are not my numbers. They are NIST’s own fi gures. The WTC’s tremendous reserve capacity was no secret. In 1964, four years before the start of construction, an article about the planned WTC appeared in the Engineering News-Record. The article declared that “live loads on these [perimeter] columns can be increased more than 2,000 percent before failure occurs.” $\\underline { { 7 2 } } \\mathrm { A }$ careful reading of the piece also gives insight into why the plane impacts were not fatal to the integrity of the outer wall. The reason is simple: The perimeter columns were designed to function together as an enormous truss, specifi cally, a Vierendeel truss. The wall was inherently stable. After the plane impacts, it behaved like an arch, simply transferring the load to the surrounding columns. As the 1964 article states, Today, years after NIST released its report, it is increasingly obvious that NIST attempted to overcome the lack of physical evidence by resorting to computer simulations. This was problematic, of course, because computer models are no better than the quality of input and the accuracy of the programmer’s assumptions. Architect Eric Douglas identifi ed another issue in his 2006 analysis of the NIST report: “… a fundamental problem with … computer simulation is the overwhelming temptation to manipulate the input data until one achieves the desired results.”74 Did NIST investigators fall prey to this tendency? Or were they somehow able to overcome the absence of physical evidence? I must ask the reader to bear with me a little longer while we explore these important questions. The purpose of NIST’s global impact analysis (NCSTAR 1-2) was to estimate the structural damage to the WTC caused by the Boeing 767s.

In this project NIST considered three different scenarios, ranging from less damage to extreme damage, with a moderate alternative (described as “the base”) in the middle. As it happened, all three accurately predicted the impact damage to the WTC exterior at the point of entry, although with regard to WTC-1 the moderate case was slightly better match. 75The three differed greatly, however, in predicting the number of severed columns at the WTC core, a datum that was obviously of great importance. In the case of WTC-1 the lesser alternative predicted only one severed core column, the moderate alternative predicted three, while the extreme alternative predicted fi ve to six. In the case of WTC-2 the disparity was even greater: The lesser alternative predicted three severed columns, the moderate fi ve, and the extreme case no less than ten.76 Although NIST never satisfactorily resolved these differences, it immediately threw out the less severe alternatives, citing two reasons in the summary report: fi rst, because they failed to predict observable damage to the far exterior walls; and second, because they did not lead to a global collapse. $\\scriptstyle { \\frac { 7 7 } { \\hbar } } \\mathrm { O n }$ September 11, 2001, the North Tower sustained visible damage to the wall opposite the impact of Flight 11. This was caused by an errant landing gear and by a piece of the fuselage, which passed through the tower and came out the other side. Both parts were later recovered. During the second impact (of Flight 175), the same phenomenon was repeated: A jet engine was seen exiting WTC-2’s opposite wall at high speed and was later found on Murray Street, several blocks northeast of the WTC. In its summary report, NIST leads us to believe that the observable damage to the far walls caused by these ejected Boeing 767 parts validated its simulations. Yet, in one of its supplementary documents NIST admits that “because of [computer] model size constraints, the panels on the south side of WTC-1 were modeled with a coarse resolution … The model [thus] … underestimates the damage to the tower on this face.” $\\underline { { 7 8 } } \\mathrm { { B u t } }$ , notice, this means that none of the three alternatives accurately predicted the exit damage.79 This admission, deeply buried in the 43-volume report, is fatal to NIST’s fi rst rationale for rejecting the lesser alternative, since it was no less accurate than the moderate and extreme cases.

The simulations for WTC-2 suffered from the same modeling defect. Once again, NIST rejected the lesser alternative, even though “none of the three WTC-2 global impact simulations resulted in a large engine fragment exiting the tower” [my emphasis]. 80Again, we can thank researcher Eric Douglas for digging deeper than the summary report. Otherwise, this fl aw, tantamount to the devil lurking in the fi ne print, might never have come to light. But NIST was undeterred by its own biased reasoning. Later, it also tossed out the moderate (base) alternative, and ultimately adopted the most extreme scenario in its subsequent global collapse analysis, even though, as noted, the lesser alternatives were just as accurate from a predictive standpoint as the extreme case. In fact, with regard to predicting the entry damage to WTC-1, as noted, the moderate alternative was actually a better match. The NIST report offers no scientifi c rationale for this decision, only the pithy comment that the moderate alternatives “were discarded after the structural response analysis of major subsystems were compared with observed events.” 81Here, of course, “observed events” refers to the ultimate collapse of the towers. Things get worse. It would appear that NIST nearly failed to generate a collapse even with the extreme alternatives, which required further tinkering. As the report informs us: “Complete sets of simulations were then performed for cases B and D [the extreme alternatives for the two towers].

Needless to say, the NIST report fails to give specifi cs about the “additional inputs.” We are left to use our imagination.

The late Cornell astronomer Carl Sagan used to say that “extraordinary claims require extraordinary proof.” By this tough but reasonable standard, the offi cial explanation about the collapse of the WTC on September 11, 2001 was without question an extraordinary claim, because there were no historical precedents. I will say it again: No steel-frame skyscraper had ever collapsed due to fi re-weakened columns. By this standard the offi cial account required an extraordinary level of proof. Yet, as I have just shown, NIST failed to muster even a minimal evidentiary case. From the start, NIST’s investigation was biased, hence unscientifi c. Indeed, its report is “a triumph” of circular reasoning. The report actually left me slightly agog, in a state of mild shock at the disparity between NIST’s research and its conclusions. NIST never overcame the lack of hard data about actual conditions at the WTC core — certainly not by resorting to computer models. Had its program been robust enough to properly characterize the far walls, investigators might have utilized the known exterior damage to those far walls to discriminate between the three alternatives and, thusly, to select the best choice, possibly validating the model. Failing this, NIST had no sound basis for rejecting the lesser and moderate alternatives. Both were at least as plausible as the extreme case. Why were they not given equal weight? The answer is obvious: that would have compelled NIST investigators to entertain the unthinkable, i.e., the possibility that some other causative agent was responsible for the WTC collapse. And what might that other agent be? There is only one serious candidate: high-temperature explosives. Of course, NIST’s failure to explain the World Trade Center collapse does not, in and of itself, prove that explosives were used. But it ought to inspire us to revisit this alternative with renewed interest, especially in light of the compelling evidence I have already presented. I was led to ask, Is there other evidence for explosives, in addition to the tell-tale residues in the dust? For example, were there eyewitnesses? The answer is an emphatic “Yes.” Many eyewitnesses reported hearing, feeling and seeing explosions at Ground Zero on 9/11; and their ranks swelled dramatically in 2005 when the city of New York released 503 oral histories of NYC fi remen, paramedics and emergency medical technicians who were at the WTC on the day of the attack. The FDNY had gathered these interviews between October 2001 and January 2002 at the order of then-New York Fire Commissioner Thomas Van Essen, who later told the New York Times he wanted to preserve the accounts for historical reasons, “before they became reshaped by a collective memory.” The department", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:The 9_11 Mystery Plane - Mark H.

The city had withheld all of this material for several years because, as Nicholas Scoppetta, Van Essen’s successor, told the New York Times, federal prosecutors advised him that its publication might impede the ongoing prosecution of alleged al Qaeda terrorist Zacarias Moussaoui. 83The reason was fl imfl am. The histories obviously had no bearing on the Moussaoui trial. At any rate, this was the opinion of the NY state Court of Appeals, which ordered most of the material to be released, the result of a lawsuit fi led by the New York Times and joined by the families of the victims. The oral histories were eventually made public in August 2005, and they are currently posted on the New York Times website. 84Notably, of the 503 testimonials, at least 118, i.e., 23% of the total, mention explosions in the WTC. This was the conclusion of Graeme MacQueen, former professor of religion at McMaster University, Hamilton, Ontario, who conducted a comprehensive review of the transcripts in 2006. MacQueen found no evidence that coercive measures had been used in gathering what he describes as “a remarkably rich body of narrative material.” $\\underline { { 8 5 } } \\mathrm { I n }$ his opinion the responders gave their oral accounts freely and spontaneously, although some apparently read from written reports prepared ahead of time. In reviewing the material MacQueen found only a few cases where the questioner may have led the witness. All told, MacQueen counted 177 unambiguous references to explosions in the accounts of 118 different witnesses. The number of references is higher than the number of witnesses because some responders were emphatic about explosions and mention them more than once. Although interpreting the histories was unavoidably subjective, MacQueen took pains to screen out cases that might be construed as ambiguous. For example, he excluded descriptive words like “roar,” “rumble,” “shake,” and “earthquake” in the absence of more explicit language. Only the histories with unambiguous references to explosions were counted, i.e., those including words like “blast,” “explosion,” “secondary device,” “bomb,” “blow up,” and “implosion.” MacQueen was impressed by the large number of eyewitnesses who reported explosions. He thinks the total would have been even higher but for the fact that many accounts show signs of revisionism.

He thinks the total would have been even higher but for the fact that many accounts show signs of revisionism. Notwithstanding Fire Commissioner Van Essen’s laudable aim of collecting the histories while still fresh in memory, some responders evidently had already changed their minds by the time the interviews were conducted. MacQueen thinks these responders were probably infl uenced by the media’s overwhelming tendency to describe the collapses as due to structural failure caused by the impacts and fi res. As the transcripts show, some of the interviewees tiptoe around the issue of explosions, as if reluctant to use the word. These individuals probably had come to believe that their original impressions were mistaken. Even so, only two responders out of 503 explicitly denied that explosions had occurred. Seven others described the collapses solely in terms of a pancaking mechanism. MacQueen concludes that the oral histories lend strong support to the reality of explosions, while offering scant support for a non-explosive collapse scenario.86 I should mention that one self-professed debunker of “conspiracy theorists,” Mark Roberts, has sharply criticized MacQueen’s analysis of the oral histories. $\\scriptstyle { \\frac { 8 7 } { 4 } } \\mathrm { O n }$ his website Roberts claims that MacQueen greatly exaggerated the number of references to explosions. Roberts did his own review and counted only thirty-one such cases, a number that is still signifi cant, though much smaller. His criticism inspired me to conduct my own review. I concluded that although a few of MacQueen’s judgments (out of 118) may be questionable, this would be expected in any evaluation involving a subjective opinion. On the whole, I believe MacQueen conducted a competent survey, and I agree with his conclusions. I would add that while reading through the transcripts, I also noticed that several of the eyewitnesses went further and explicitly compared the collapses to controlled demolitions. For example, one New York City fi refi ghter, Richard Banaciski, stated that “it seemed like on television [when] they blow up these buildings.”88 Thomas Fiztpatrick, an FDNY deputy commissioner, made a similar remark: “My initial reaction was that this was exactly the way it looks when they show you those implosions on TV.”89 A third fi refi ghter, Kenneth Rogers, said that “it looked like a synchronized deliberate sort of thing.” 90Two other witnesses even wondered aloud if the United States was under a nuclear attack.91 Needless to say, Roberts, who himself agrees with the offi cial narrative, fails to mention any of these cases, for reasons that should be obvious.

This kind of omission no longer surprises me. It has been my experience that debunkers of “conspiracy theories” tend to be at least as selective in citing evidence as the offi cial investigators. Although the oral histories, were only made public in August 2005, according to the New York Times, the 9/11 Commission and NIST both gained access to the material long before this by bringing legal threats against the city of New York.92 The 9/11 Commission actually drew upon the histories while drafting chapter nine of its fi nal report, which covers the plane impacts and WTC collapse. Chapter nine makes reference to “our review of 500 internal FDNY interview transcripts.”93 A reader, however, will search the chapter in vain for any mention of the 118 responders who saw, felt and heard explosions. In fact, in the entire 567-page 9/11 Commission Report there is only one reference to explosions. The lone mention was drawn from interviews that the panel conducted in 2004, and is presented not as part of a discussion of an alternative collapse scenario (i.e., a demolition caused by explosions), but rather, for the purpose of discrediting the witness for even thinking such thoughts. Here is the text: When the South Tower collapsed, fi re fi ghters on upper fl oors of the North Tower heard a violent roar, and many were knocked off their feet; they saw debris coming up the stairs and observed that the power was lost and emergency light activated. Nevertheless, those fi refi ghters not standing near windows facing south had no way of knowing that the South Tower had collapsed; many surmised that a bomb had exploded, or that the North Tower had suffered a partial collapse on its upper fl oors [my emphasis].94 A reader who knows nothing about the oral histories will probably interpret this as an isolated case, and will judge that the fi remen were simply mistaken. No doubt this was the drafters’ intent. NIST also acquired the oral histories, and likewise fails to discuss them in its fi nal report. For this reason, NIST’s categorical statement that it “found no corroborating evidence … that the WTC towers were brought down by controlled demolition using explosives”95 is simply a lie. There is no other word for it, because NIST surely knew about the eyewitness accounts. I should mention that a few debunkers of “conspiracy theories” have advanced more thoughtful arguments.

There is no other word for it, because NIST surely knew about the eyewitness accounts. I should mention that a few debunkers of “conspiracy theories” have advanced more thoughtful arguments. In May 2007 Zdeněk P. BaŽant et al. published a paper, “Collapse of WTC Towers: What Did and Did Not Cause It?” in which they attempt to show that “allegations of controlled demolition by planted explosives” have no scientifi c merit. 96The authors argue that during the gravitational collapse, air was forcibly ejected from the buildings at high speed, causing loud sonic booms that some witnesses probably mistook for explosions. Their theory is plausible, but even if it is partly correct, it fails to account for all of the eyewitness accounts, since many witnesses reported hearing, seeing and feeling explosions well before the onset of the collapse. Graeme MacQueen has catalogued these accounts in his response.97 The sonic boom theory is also refuted by a separate group of at least fourteen eyewitnesses, who claim that an enormous explosion ripped through WTC-1 even before Flight 11 struck the tower. The spokesman for this group, William Rodriguez, had been a custodian at the WTC for twenty years. On the day of the attack he arrived for work at 8:30 a.m., and was in the B-1 basement of the North Tower talking with his supervisor when an enormous blast shook the room. Rodriquez is emphatic that the explosion came from below. He says the blast pushed him upwards, collapsed part of the ceiling, cracked the concrete walls, and even caused the sprinkler system to come on. Rodriguez thought a generator had exploded on a lower level. He goes on to say that, moments later, he felt the impact of Flight 11, high above. 98A coworker agrees, and it is hard to dismiss their story because, as janitors, they were well acquainted with the building and surely would have known if a loud sound or explosion came from above or below.99 After the explosion, Rodriquez assisted a badly burned coworker, Felipe David, out of the building, then returned to help others. He freed several individuals trapped in an elevator, then used his master key to save a group of fi remen stuck in a stairwell. Rodriguez climbed as high as the 39th fl oor, and he says that while assisting with the evacuation he heard and felt numerous other explosions. He was also one of the last people out of WTC-1 and survived only because he crawled under a fi re engine, which shielded him during the collapse.

Rodriguez emerged as one of the genuine heroes of 9/11. He was feted at the White House and even testifi ed before the 9/11 Commission — behind closed doors, at their insistence. But, of course, the fi nal report makes no mention of his testimony about explosions. Rodriguez also contacted the FBI and made repeated attempts to reach NIST, without success. 100Rodriguez says he eventually did succeed in speaking with NIST offi cials at one of the agency’s public hearings. Afterward, he described the experience: “ … I asked them before they came up with their conclusion … if they ever considered my statements or the statements of any of the other survivors who heard the explosions. They just stared at me with blank faces.” 101Rodriguez says that at this point he realized the offi cial investigation was a sham. Thereafter he began to speak out about his experience. The many eyewitness accounts of explosions in the WTC are politically incorrect, but they are supported by physical evidence in addition to the residues found in the WTC dust. One example is Rick Siegel’s dramatic videotape, which Siegel fi lmed from the New Jersey shore of the Hudson. But even to call it “dramatic” fails to do it justice. The footage is nothing short of astonishing. Siegel lived in Hoboken at the time, and on the morning of September 11, after hearing about the events at the WTC, he hurried down to the waterfront, set up his camera, and proceeded to capture most of the tragedy on fi lm. The WTC was two miles away across the Hudson River. But Siegel overcame the distance thanks to his unimpeded vantage point, and because he used a tripod. However, the audio portion is what makes the footage so powerful. Siegel captured on a tape the enormous explosions that ripped through the South Tower moments before it fell. These were not tiny pops, but thunderous blasts that carried across the water. The explosions can be heard distinctly in the audio. Siegel’s fi lm, 911 Eyewitness, is available for purchase on the Internet.102 My own reaction, the fi rst time I watched it, was shock: To think that the networks never aired this important evidence!

The video should have been on the six o’clock nightly news. After one large blast, a dust cloud is seen rising from the base of the WTC, at the level of the street, indicating that the explosion must have occurred on the lower levels, far from where Flights 11 and 175 impacted the buildings. Seconds later, the South Tower starts to collapse from the top down. Later in the tape a second series of explosions rocks the North Tower before it too falls. Siegel’s video corroborates the many witnesses who heard, felt and saw explosions prior to the start of collapse. Jim Hoffman, another 9/11 investigator, has criticized Siegel for the way he packaged his fi lm, and Hoffman makes some good points.103 911 Eyewitness was over-produced. Some of Siegel’s supplementary analysis may also be questionable. Even so, his raw footage speaks for itself and is extremely important evidence. Nor did I see anything that made me doubt its authenticity. If the video is bona fi de, and I strongly suspect this is the case, it proves that the many eyewitnesses who reported explosions in the WTC were telling the truth. Siegel should be encouraged to enlist experts to thoroughly vet his tape. Once this is done, some brave producer needs to air it on national television. 60 Minutes would be an ideal venue. Although it is common knowledge that the earth shook like an earthquake during the WTC collapse, it is less well-known that the shaking started well before the onset of the collapse — exactly what you would expect, assuming that large explosions ripped through each tower prior to collapse. This too was reported by numerous eyewitnesses. However, I will not review the accounts here, because others have already done so, and in my opinion quite adequately. 104 My point is that physical evidence also supports these accounts. Luckily, an unknown cameraman captured a must-see short video of the onset of the collapse of WTC-1 from a nearby rooftop. Although his/ her identity is unknown to this writer, the 2.6 MB video can still be dowloaded from the Internet, where it has been posted for years. 105The clip was featured in Dylan Avery’s 911 documentary, Loose Change (2nd Edition). Why is this footage important? Because the photographer, like Rick Siegel, had the presence of mind to plant the video-cam on a tripod.

The video is of good quality, but even more importantly, it is steady thanks to the tripod. Suddenly, however, the frame noticeably vibrates for a full second, and then, about six seconds later the tower begins to crumble. This short clip provides compelling evidence that the witnesses who heard, saw, and felt tremors before the onset of collapse were telling the truth. Only an enormous explosion could shake the ground in this manner. Notice, I have not even discussed the case of WTC-7, which was not hit by a plane, hence had no spillage of jet fuel, and suffered only some exterior damage on its south side and relatively minor fi res on several fl oors. Yet, at 5:20 P.M. on the afternoon of 9/11 this 47-story steelframe WTC-7 dropped into its footprint like a stone. The how and the why evidently proved so troublesome to NIST’s scientists that the agency chose to drop the issue from its September 2005 report. To this day, the collapse of WTC-7 has never been explained, certainly not by NIST, whose separate fi nal report on the issue is long overdue. NIST’s last press release on the matter, dated June 29, 2007, failed even to speculate about a release date. As of August 2008 a posting on the NIST website stated that the “fi nal report for WTC-7 is not yet complete” and “will be released in draft form for public comment and posted on this website as soon as it is available.”106 NIST may have consigned its WTC-7 report to bureaucratic limbo, but the absence of a report is no substitute for an explanation. In the meanwhile, time does not stand still. Even as NIST ducks the issue, the tide is turning against the offi cial WTC collapse theory. Increasing numbers of experts are voicing doubts, and some have gone further. In 2007 two leading Swiss structural engineers stated in public that the collapse of WTC-7 was in their view a controlled demolition.107 Recently, a Dutch demolition expert named Danny Jowenko reached the same conclusion after a television crew showed him the video of the WTC-7 collapse.108 At the time Jowenko had no knowledge about WTC-7, and did not even know that a third steel skyscraper had collapsed in New York on 9/11.

He replied that he designed them to withstand the impact of a Boeing 707, the largest commercial jetliner of the day. In 1993 Skilling evidently saw no reason to revise his original opinion in light of the more recent Boeing 767s, which are slightly larger: “Our analysis indicated the biggest problem would be the fact that all the fuel (from the airplane) would dump into the building. There would be a horrendous fi re. A lot of people would be killed. The building structure would still be there.” Eric Nalder, “Twin Towers Engineered To Withstand Jet Collision,” Seattle Times, February 27, 1993. Interestingly, one week before the September 11 attack, Skilling’s partner, Leslie Robertson, spoke at a conference in Frankfurt, Germany. When asked what he had done to protect the towers from terrorism, Robertson confi rmed Skilling: “I designed it for a 707 to smash into it.” “Towers Build to Withstand Jet Impact.” Chicago Tribune, Sep- tember 12, 2001. 7 In July 1971 the WTC won a national award when the American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE) named it “the engineering project that demonstrates the greatest engi- neering skills and represents the greatest contribution to engineering progress and man- kind.” Angus K.

According to the offi cial story, the plan to attack America on 9/11 was carried out by a core group of four Islamic extremists based in Hamburg, Germany: Mohamed Atta, Ramzi Binalshibh, Marwan al-Shehhi, and Ziad Jarrah. Determined to strike a blow against imperialism — we are told — the group initially sought to join the Islamic resistance movement in Chechnya, which at the time was battling the Russians. Their plan became untenable, however, when it was learned that the Chechnyan border had been closed. The aspiring jihadists made their way to Afghanistan instead, where they supposedly arrived in late Novem- ber 1999. Almost immediately they were granted an audience with the legendary fi gure of Osama bin Laden. According to the story, bin Laden had been planning an attack on America since March-April of 1999, when he supposedly approved a hijack plan conceived by one of his top lieutenants, Khalid Sheikh Mohammed. (Here, I must remind the reader that it is still impossible to separate fact from myth — I am merely recounting the offi cial history.) Bin Laden was reportedly overjoyed by the arrival of these fresh recruits, all of whom were well educated, had lived in the West, and spoke several languages, including English. From what is known of Atta, he was apparently fl uent in German, French, and English, in addition to his native Arabic. For these reasons the aspiring terrorists had extremely high value from the standpoint of jihad.1 The four supposedly swore allegiance to bin Laden, who selected Mohamed Atta to be their leader. After some basic training at bin Laden’s camp they returned to Germany in January 2000 and began the methodical planning which led to the September 11 attack. One of the fi rst steps, of course, was to emigrate to the United States. To conceal their visit to Afghanistan, the group reported their passports lost or stolen and were duly issued new and unblemished travel documents. At this point they applied for visas. By March 2000 the group was searching the Internet for information about American fl ight schools. Two members of the group, Mohamed Atta and Marwan al-Shehhi eventually enrolled at Huffman Aviation, located in Venice, Florida. Another, Ziad Jarrah, was accepted for training at the Florida Flight Training Center (FFTC), also in Venice. The fourth member, Ramzi Binalshibh, failed to obtain an entry visa to the U.S., probably because of his Yemeni background, and had to forego fl ight instruction. Binalshibh remained in Germany, where he helped in a support capacity. His eventual replacement was Hani Hanjour, who allegedly piloted Flight 77 into the Pentagon. The 9/11 Commission Report states that in the fall of 2000 Atta, al-Shehhi and Jarrah successfully completed their courses at the Venice fl ight schools.

The 9/11 Commission Report states that in the fall of 2000 Atta, al-Shehhi and Jarrah successfully completed their courses at the Venice fl ight schools. Atta and al-Shehhi received their pilot’s licenses in December 2000. 2Here, however, the offi cial narrative breaks down, because in no way did the fl ight training at Huffman and FFTC prepare the three jihadists to pilot Boeing 767s and 757s — just one of many sizable holes in the offi cial conspiracy theory. 3 As we know, in the days after the 9/11 attack the world press swarmed into Venice, Florida, looking for a sensational story about Mohamed Atta and the other pilots. One of the feature attractions was Rudi Dekkers, owner of Huffman Aviation. Dekkers became an instant celebrity, made the rounds of the national media, and even testifi ed before Congress. He told reporters that his school offered fl ight instruction in light aircraft only, not commercial jetliners. 4His statement should have raised eyebrows, because there is a galaxy of difference between a small Cessna and a commercial Boeing jetliner. The9/11 Commission Report offers very little in in the way of clarifi cation on this vital point. It merely states that the terrorists subsequently prepared for the 9/11 attack by training on fl ight simulators.5 End of story. We are supposed to fi ll in the blanks and leap to the conclusion that during the remaining nine months of their lives, the al Qaeda pilots somehow and somewhere picked up the necessary skills to fl y large airliners into tall buildings — a considerable leap, as we are about to learn. In June 2002, FBI Director Robert S. Mueller told the Joint Intelligence Committee that in late December 2000 Mohamed Atta and Marwan al-Shehhi showed up at the SimCenter fl ight school at Opa-locka Airport, near Miami, for a single session in a Boeing 767 fl ight simulator. Another statement by the FBI to this effect can be found in the transcript of the trial of Zacarias Moussaoui.6 At the trial, the FBI produced a fi nancial document indicating that Atta and al-Shehhi paid $2500 for the session.7 However, the FBI released no further details. In the course of researching this book, I made strenuous efforts to learn more about the 767 training session, and I did manage to reach the offi ce of an executive of Pan Am International (which owns Opa-locka). However, he refused to speak with me on the telephone.

However, he refused to speak with me on the telephone. Later, I contacted Judy Glass, the PR person for Pan Am, who promised that she would look into the matter and get back to me with the details. But she never did. Months later, when I again attempted to reach Ms. Glass, she would not even return my calls. Obviously, for whatever reason, Pan Am International is refusing to release any information about the reported 767 simulator session. The question is why? Evidently, Atta and al-Shehhi also purchased time at Opa-locka in a Boeing 727 simulator. In this case, fortunately, the New York Times was able to dig up some details. 8Henry George, an instructor at the school, later told the Times that each of the hijackers spent a grand total of three hours in the simulator. Atta paid George the handsome fee of $1500 for the privilege. The ringleader Atta is known to have worn a money belt, and on occasion fl ashed large amounts of cash. There are even stories of Atta tossing hundred-dollar bills at people. 9Evidently, something similar occurred on this occasion. George explained that it was not a formal training program in jet fl ight, but “a mini mini introduction.” He said the two spent most of their time in the simulator practicing maneuvers and turns, although they also did take-offs and landings. Said George, “They did not seem to have the skill to pilot real jetliners, although they could turn the planes.” A Boeing 727 has three engines, rather than two, and features an oldfashioned cockpit with analog gauges and dials — very different from the digital instrumentation of a Boeing 767, which requires special training. A 727 is also much smaller and more maneuverable than a 767. Nonetheless, a few hours in the 727 simulator would have given Atta and al-Shehhi at least the feel of a large jetliner. Crucially, the story mentions nothing about whether the two practiced suicide runs at buildings, and we must conclude on this basis they did not. If they had, it is certain that George, who supervised their sessions, would have noticed. The only other possibility is that he failed to mention the fact to the Times, which is just not credible, given what happened on 9/11. Nor would the Times have failed to recognize a blockbuster story. Imagine the sensational headline:TERRORISTS PRACTICED CRASHING JETLINER! The header alone would have sold out the entire edition.

I am not trying to be fl ip or cute. The point is deadly serious. As we are about to learn, crashing large commercial airplanes into tall buildings is neither simple nor easy. It requires the practiced skills of a professional, hence would entail considerable training ahead of time. This is why U.S. Air Force pilots spend hundreds of hours in the air practicing approaches and bombing runs. They do this in peacetime to hone fl ight skills which must be second nature in wartime. As with anything else, practice makes perfect. One of the biggest problems with the offi cial 9/11 narrative is that there is absolutely no evidence that the alleged hijackers had the requisite level of skill needed to fl y Boeing 767s or 757s, let alone make suicide runs. Indeed, the available evidence indicates that they were barely able to fl y small planes. We know, for example, that in September 2000. Atta and al-Shehhi fl unked a “stage I rating test” at Jones Aviation, another Florida fl ight school, located in Sarasota. After fl unking the test, the two quit the school in frustration. It was not an advanced program either, but a basic course. Later, the instructor told the Washington Post, “They chose to go back to Huffman, We didn’t kick them out, but they didn’t live up to our standards.” 10That the two continued to struggle with basic skills is shown by the following incident. Just days after receiving their pilot’s licenses (in December 2000), Atta and al-Shehhi reportedly rented a small plane (a Piper Warrior) from Huffman Aviation and fl ew to Miami International Airport.11 After they touched down, the plane’s engine stalled and died while they were taxiing on the runway. At that point the two men turned off the controls, climbed out of the cockpit, and simply abandoned the plane on the tarmac — a defi nite “no-no” in the aviation business. After walking away, Atta and al-Shehhi rented a car and returned to Venice. Later, the abandoned Piper was towed to a nearby hanger and checked out by a qualifi ed plane mechanic. But he found no mechanical problems. The engine had apparently fl ooded, nothing more. Atta and Shihhi lacked even the basic know-how to restart the motor of a small plane. Incidentally, their rookie mistake was also a violation of FAA regulations. If you or I had done what they did, we would have faced consequences, at the very least a stiff fi ne, possibly worse.

But Atta and al-Shehhi did not even receive a reprimand. Why not? Were they protected? An honest investigation would have pursued these questions. But there is not a peep about any of this in the 9/11 Commission Report. The following remarkable story by a fl ight instructor named Dan Govatos speaks directly to these issues, and casts further doubt on the offi cial narrative. The story aired on May 15th, 2007, during a radio interview hosted by Mike Swenson.12 Govatos is a professional pilot with twenty-years experience, and fl ew for two major airlines. At the time of the 9/11 attack, he was employed as an FAA-authorized fl ight examiner at a training facility in Phoenix, Arizona. On the morning of 9/11 he was in a Boeing 737 fl ight simulator working with a class of pilots who had nearly completed their 737 training. Govatos was giving the trainees their “check ride,” that is, their fi nal test in the simulator, when they emerged on a break and learned about what was happening in New York. By now, the story is familiar. Someone had a television on in the break room, and like everyone else in America that day Gavatos and his pilots found themselves staring in awe and disbelief at the TV screen. Needless to say, they were horrifi ed by what they were seeing. The WTC had been hit, and columns of smoke were pouring out of the towers. The training facility was located at a Phoenix airport, which was soon shut down due to the national Ground Stop. Govatos and his pilots were unable to go home that day. They spent the night at the airport, and the next morning Govatos said, “Hey guys, let’s try something. Let’s see if we can hit those buildings. Like we saw happen.” Govatos led his class back into the simulator and set the “sim” program for New York. After which, they all took turns trying to crash the Boeing 737 into the World Trade Center. These were not novices, by the way. Although the pilots had not fl own 737s professionally, each of them had many years fl ight experience. But none of them could do it, not even after ten high-speed runs at the building, and — remember — this was a Boeing 737, which is smaller and more maneuverable than a Boeing 767. The pilots only succeeded in hitting the", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:The 9_11 Mystery Plane - Mark H.

But none of them could do it, not even after ten high-speed runs at the building, and — remember — this was a Boeing 737, which is smaller and more maneuverable than a Boeing 767. The pilots only succeeded in hitting the towers when they slowed down to near-landing speeds. This is important because, according to the offi cial story, the impacts on 9/11 occurred at high speed: Flight 11 hit the North Tower at approximately 440 mph, and Flight 175 was ripping along at 540 mph when it plowed into the South Tower. People do not realize how diffi cult it is to hand-fl y a jetliner at those high speeds. Particularly with a novice, whose experience is limited to small planes, there is a tendency to over-control everything. You’ve got to understand, when you’re going 300 knots in a Boeing airliner and you move the controls like you would expect to do in a little airplane, you couldn’t stand the “G’ forces. Everything has to be fi ngertip control. Even pilots who have logged thousands of hours of fl ight time have an extremely diffi cult time controlling a large airplane at those speeds. This is one reason why commercial pilots usually rely on the autopilot, which has been standard equipment on the large jetliners for many years. Govatos also mentioned that due to the high level of diffi culty, his pilots repeatedly tripped the crash-logic built into the Boeing fl ight program, which froze the simulator. Each time this happened, they had to stop and reset the machine. After numerous failed runs, Govatos himself fi nally succeeded in hitting the tower. But he says he knew, even before the sim trials, “Something is not right.” Meaning: with the offi cial story. During the same show, Swenson also interviewed another experienced pilot, Rob Balsamo, one of the founders of Pilots for 9/11 Truth. Balsamo explained that while he was producing the documentary fi lm Pandora’s Black Box, which analyzes the National Transportation Safety Board’s report on Flight 77, he likewise practiced crashing a Boeing 757 into the Pentagon, in this case using a Microsoft fl ight program. Balsamo, an seasoned pilot, said it took him at least fi ve to six attempts to approximate the fi nal approach of Flight 77. Yet, as we know, whoever was at the helm of Flight 77 (assuming it was Flight 77) managed it on the fi rst try. When asked by Swenson to comment on the descending Top Gun loop maneuver that Hani Hanjour supposedly made in his fi nal approach, Balsamo replied, “A lot of people say it was an impossible turning", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:The 9_11 Mystery Plane - Mark H.

But that is not the case. It is actually the opposite. It was a very graceful, in fact, a professional maneuver, well within the envelop of the aircraft. However, when the aircraft descended and rolled out of its turn on the last straight leg to the Pentagon, that maneuver itself… When you look at the yoke movement, you can tell that somebody, whoever was at those controls, was a professional and knew how to fl y the aircraft.”13 any pilots agree with this assessment. According to the Washington Post, “… aviation sources said the plane [Flight 77] was fl own with extraordinary skill, making it highly likely that a trained pilot was at the helm.”14 However, if this is true it poses major problems for the offi cial 9/11 narrative, because there is overwhelming evidence that Hani Hanjour, the terrorist who supposedly fl ew Flight 77 into the side of the Pentagon, was even less qualifi ed than Atta and al-Shehhi. Let us review this evidence. Barely fi ve feet tall and slight of build, Hani Hanjour was a native of Taif, a popular resort city in Saudi Arabia. By all accounts, he was shy and mildmannered, even to the point of being timid. Hanjour was religious, but apparently not very ambitious. As a young man he cultivated no dreams of fl ying airplanes, but aspired only to become a fl ight attendant. Later, his older brother Abulrahman encouraged him to aim higher. Even so, as we are about to discover, Hani’s aptitude for learning was rather limited. His older brother Abulrahman was also responsible for Hani’s fi rst and second trips to the U.S. His brother was in the business of exporting used American cars to Saudi Arabia, which involved frequent travel back and forth. Abulrahman had connections in the States, and in the spring of 1996 he arranged for Hani to stay in Miramar, Florida with a couple he had known: Susan and Adnan Khalil. After his arrival in America, Hanjour roomed with the family for at least a month. Later, Susan Khalil described him as socially inept, with poor English, and “really bad hygiene.”15 Susan said her husband had to remind Hani to bathe and change his clothes. In April 1996 Hani moved to Oakland, California, where he studied English for several months at Holy Names College. During this period he lived with a family who", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:The 9_11 Mystery Plane - Mark H.

In April 1996 Hani moved to Oakland, California, where he studied English for several months at Holy Names College. During this period he lived with a family who described him as a “quiet, introverted individual.” 16While in Oakland, Hanjour enrolled at the Sierra Academy of Aeronautics, but attended only one half-hour class and never returned. In the fall Hanjour moved to Scottsdale, Arizona and enrolled at Cockpit Resource Management (CRM), a fl ight school where he trained for three months. But the results were less than satisfactory. According to Duncan K.M. Hastie, owner of the school, Hani was “a weak student” who was “wasting our resources.” 17Hani withdrew from the program, then later returned in 1997 for several more weeks of instruction. This “on and off” pattern of behavior was typical of the man. Hastie says that over the next three years Hanjour called him at least twice a year, and each time wanted to return for more training. By this point, however, it was obvious to Hastie that Hani had no business in a cockpit. Hastie refused to let him come back. “I would recognize his voice,” Hastie said. “He was always talking about wanting more training. Yes, he wanted to be an airline pilot. That was his stated goal. That’s why I didn’t allow him to come back. I thought ‘You’re never going to make it.’”18 Rejected by CRM, Hanjour enrolled at nearby Sawyer Aviation, also located in the Phoenix area. Wes Fults, a former instructor at Sawyer, later described it as the school of last resort. Said Fults, “It was a commonly held truth that, if you failed anywhere else, go to Sawyer.” Fults remembers training Hanjour, whom he described as “a neophyte.” He says Hani “got overwhelmed with the instruments” in the school’s fl ight simulator. “He had only the barest understanding of what the instruments were there to do,” said Fults. “He [Hanjour] used the simulator three or four times, then disappeared like a fog.”19 I must emphasize to the reader that I’m not making this up. Other accounts in Newsday, the New York Times, as well as stories by the major networks, all corroborate the portrait of general ineptitude. Even the FBI confi rms the basic story.20 Yet, somewhere along the way Hani qualifi ed for a pilot’s license.

The pertinent line reads, “[In 2000] Hani began refresher training at his old school, Arizona Aviation.”22 Notice, again, the implied pattern of “on-again, off-again” behavior. Although Hani Hanjour arrived sooner and spent more time in the U.S. than the other alleged hijackers, he never mastered the English lan- guage. Hani never learned to write English, and by all accounts his spoken English was atrocious. Incidentally, this sets Hani apart from Mohamed Atta and the other better-educated members of the Hamburg cell. It also raises a red fl ag, because in the U.S., fl uency in English is required to ob- tain a pilot’s license. Hani’s poor English and his sub-standard piloting skills actually prompted one fl ight school, Jet Tech, to question the authenticity of Hani’s FAA-approved pilot’s license. Jet Tech was another of the schools in the Phoenix area where Hani sought continuing instruction. Peggy Chevrette, Jet Tech’s operation manager, later told FOX News, “I couldn’t believe that he had a license of any kind with the skills that he had.” 23She explained that Hani’s English was so bad it took him fi ve hours to complete an oral exam that should normally have taken about two hours. Nor did Hani’s answers impress the Jet Tech fl ight instructor: on the contrary. The instructor’s evaluation notes, … student [Hani] made numerous errors during [his] performance … [and displayed] a lack of understanding of some basic concepts. The same was true during review of systems knowledge. The root cause is most likely due to the student’s lack of experience. 24Early in 2001, Chevrette contacted the FAA to convey her concerns about Hani. In fact, she called a number of times. Eventually a federal inspector, John Anthony, showed up at the school and examined Hani’s credentials. But Hani’s papers were in order, and Anthony took no further action. The inspector even suggested that the school provide Hani with an interpreter. This surprised Chevrette, because it was a violation of FAA rules. “The thing that really concerned me,” she later told FOX News, “Was that John had a conversation in the hallway with Hani and realized what his skills were at that point and his ability to speak English.” 25Evidently, Anthony also sat in on a class with Hani. Although FOX News was unable to reach Anthony for comment, FAA spokesperson Laura Brown defended the FAA employee. “There was nothing", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:The 9_11 Mystery Plane - Mark H.

Although FOX News was unable to reach Anthony for comment, FAA spokesperson Laura Brown defended the FAA employee. “There was nothing about the pilot’s actions” she said, “to signal criminal intent or that would have caused us to alert law enforcement.”26 This is true enough. The Jet Tech staff never suspected that Hani was a terrorist. According to Marilyn Ladner, vicepresident Pan Am International, the company that owned Jet Tech, “It was more of a very typical instructional concern that you really shouldn’t be in the air.’”27 At least one FAA inspector, Michael Gonzales, disagrees. Gonzales, who is also the president of a professional organization that represents FAA inspectors, told the Associated Press, “There should have been a stop right then and there.” Gonzales thinks Hani should have been reexamined, as required by law.28 Although Pan Am dissolved its Jet Tech operation shortly after 9/11, a former employee who knew Hani expressed amazement “that he [Hani] could have fl own into the Pentagon. He could not fl y at all.”29 According to the offi cial narrative, in the weeks before the September 11 attack at least two of the alleged hijackers, i.e., Hani Hanjour and Ziad Jarrah, rented small planes at local airports on the outskirts of New York and Washington DC for the purpose of familiarizing themselves with the intended targets. But at least one of these ventures did not go according to plan. During the second week of August 2001, Hanjour attempted to rent a plane at Freeway Airport in Bowie, Maryland, about twenty miles from Washington. Although Hani presented his FAA license, the airport manager insisted for safety reasons that an instructor fi rst accompany him on a test fl ight to confi rm his piloting skills. During three such fl ights in a single-engine Cessna 172, instructors Sheri Baxter and Ben Conner observed what others had before them: Hanjour had trouble controlling and landing the aircraft. Even though Hami had a license and a log book showing 600 hours of fl ight time, Freeway’s chief instructor Marcel Bernard refused to rent him a plane without additional lessons.30 Let us remember, this was just weeks before the 9/11 attack. The 9/11 Commission Report acknowledges Hani’s poor English and his sub-standard piloting skills.31 It also mentions that fl ight instructors had urged him to give up trying to become a pilot.

But the report then dodges crucial questions: First, why did the FAA grant Hani Hanjour a pilot’s license in the fi rst place? Second, who was responsible? And third, how did Hani come to have 600 hours of fl ight time in his log book? The high number suggests that the log book may have been falsifi ed. But one will search the offi cial report in vain for any discussion of these important questions. Instead of providing answers, the report cavalierly states that Hani qualifi ed for a license because he “persevered.” But this is absurd. In fact, it is an obvious case of deception, because clearly Hanjour’s English and piloting skills never improved. What is more, the 9/11 Commission surely knew this. The basic facts were readily available, having been established by the press in open-source accounts in the days and weeks following 9/11, long before the start of the offi cial investigation. It now appears that Hanjour may have exploited a loophole in the FAA system to obtain his pilot’s license. For many years the FAA has allowed private contractors to certify pilots, and agency records show that Hani Hanjour did indeed obtain certifi cation in this manner, that is, by hiring a private examiner. This was fi rst reported by the Dallas Morning News in June 2002. According to the story, Hanjour was certifi ed in April 1999 as an “Airplane Multi-Engine Land/Commercial Pilot” by Daryl Strong, one of the FAA’s 20,000 designated pilot examiners. Les Dorr, an FAA offi cial, defended the agency’s longtime policy of outsourcing the certifi cation process. But a critic, Heather Awsumb, took issue with it. Awsumb is a spokesperson for the Professional Airways Systems Specialists Union, which represents more than 11,000 FAA and Defense Department employees. She pointed out that the FAA does not have anywhere near enough staff to oversee the 20,000 designated inspectors, who have a fi nancial interest in certifying as many pilots as possible. This might also explain how Hani evaded the language requirement. Said Awsumb, “They receive between $200 and $300 for each fl ight check. If they get a reputation for being too tough, they won’t get any business.” She added that the present system allows “safety to be sold to the lowest bidder.”32 While this might explain how Hani Hanjour obtained his pilot’s license, it does not begin to account for the fi nal approach of Flight 77 (or whatever hit the Pentagon).

Given the facts, the offi cial narrative cannot possibly be correct, because it is obvious that Hani Hanjour was completely incapable of fl ying a Boeing 757 airliner, and therefore could not have crashed Flight 77 into the Pentagon at 530 mph on the morning of September 11. This brings us to the vital question: If not Hani Hanjour, who or what was at the helm? The facts impel us to examine all of the possibilities, which thankfully are few in number. According to the offi cial narrative, on the day of the attack Hanjour was accompanied by four other al Qaeda terrorists, the so called “muscle hijackers.” Their job was to seize the cockpit, subdue the crew, and control the passengers. Did the FBI simply err when it identifi ed Hani Hanjour as the pilot? Perhaps one of these other jihadists was fl ying the plane: Nawaf al Hazmi, Khalid al Mihdhar, Majed Moqed, or Salem al-Hazmi. Two of the men, Nawaf al Hazmi and Khalid al Mihdhar, did study at a U.S. fl ight school. According to the Washington Post, the two began fl ight lessons in May 2000, several months after their arrival in the U.S., at which time they enrolled at Sorbi’s Flying Club near San Diego.33 As in Hani’s case, the project did not go well. Rick Garza, who was the fl ight instructor at Sorbi’s at the time, says the two men spoke little English, yet were impatient and wanted to learn to fl y large Boeing jets. “They had zero training before they got here,” he said, “so I told them, they had to learn a lot of other things fi rst. It was like dumb and dumber, I mean, they were clueless. It was clear to me they were not going to make it as pilots.”34 After a half dozen ground lessons and two fl ights, Garza sat the two men down and told them: “This is not going to work out.” Garza says they offered him extra money if he would continue the training, but to his credit, Garza refused. So ended their plans to become suicide pilots. This rules out both al Hazmi and al Mihdhar. Another alleged hijacker, Majed Moqed, also a Saudi, reportedly studied law at King Fahd University before dropping out, after which he was recruited by al Qaeda.35 A law student certainly did not fl y a Boeing jetliner into the Pentagon.

Scratch Moqed. We will probably never know the true identity of the last member of the alleged hijacker crew. Although the name released by the FBI was “Salem al-Hazmi” — supposedly the younger brother of Nawaf al Hazmi — we now know this name was merely an assumed identity. Within weeks of 9/11, it was revealed that several of the alleged hijackers in fact were not dead, but were alive and well. This includes the real Salem al-Hamzi, who at the time apparently was working at a government-owned petrochemical complex in the city of Yanbu, Saudi Arabia.36 After the attack Salem saw his photo in the newspaper and was shocked to learn that the U.S. government had accused him of hijacking Flight 77. During an interview, Salem told reporters he had never been to the United States. He also explained that someone had stolen his passport during a trip to Cairo three years before 9/11. Evidently the impostor reversed the “z” and $\" _ { \\mathrm { m } } \\cdot \\ r _ { \\mathrm { ~ \\ r ~ } }$ in his surname, i.e., from “Hamzi” to “Hazmi,” the spelling that appears on a New Jersey driver’s license, which — we are told — was recovered at the Pentagon crash scene.37 Everything else was a match, including the photo, as noted, the birth date, and other personal information. The facts clearly point to a case of identity theft. However, the story also has a curious twist that could be trivia, but then again, just might turn out to be extremely important. Recall the bin Laden video released by the U.S. government in December 2001, which purportedly features Osama bin Laden sitting around with comrades boasting about al Qaeda’s involvement in the 9/11 attack. According to the Bush administration, the one-hour-long video is proof of bin Laden’s involvement. Yet, as I have noted, experts dispute the DoD’s translation from the Arabic, and many doubt that the character in the video is actually bin Laden. No one has explained why bin Laden, a known southpaw, is seen in the fi lm writing with his right hand. But here is the twist: shortly after the footage was released, CBS reported that the names of several of the nineteen alleged hijackers are mentioned in the video by bin Laden himself, apparently in the context of praising them as martyrs.38 The names include one Salem Alhamzi, who, I think, we may fairly judge to", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:The 9_11 Mystery Plane - Mark H.

Curiously, the spelling reported by CBS was “Hamzi,” 39 rather than “Hazmi,” the signifi cance of which is unclear. Without more information we cannot be certain why the “z” and “m” were switched. What is certain is that the real bin Laden (assuming his guilt) would have known the hijacker’s actual name. So why, after just taking credit for the crime of the century, would bin Laden heap praise upon an assumed identity? This makes no sense. Surely bin Laden would have praised the jihadist by his actual name, rather than praising an alias. If this somewhat speculative analysis is on target, then it is more evidence of fakery. Did the perpetrators slip up when preparing the script for the video, by mentioning the assumed name? If so, covert operators are human like the rest of us and do sometimes make mistakes. On a scale of one to ten, this was a whopper. We have followed the tracks into a forest of detail. Let us now step back and revisit the big picture. From the moment we acknowledge the high likelihood that explosives were used on 9/11 to demolish the World Trade Center, we are compelled to entertain a new point of view, and by this I mean through the eyes of the perpetrators. Surely the planting of charges in the towers was a major undertaking, and took weeks or months to complete. Yet, once the decision was made, the evildoers were fully committed. The “planes operation” had to move forward, and the margin for error was small. The operation was complex. There were many things that could go wrong, any one of which threatened to expose the plan. There was a signifi cant danger, for instance, that the explosives would be discovered prematurely. Moreover the planes had to hit the specifi ed buildings on target, point blank, and no mistake about it. A botched crash might also expose the operation. Given all of this, is it reasonable to suppose that the perpetrators would place their trust in four rank amateur pilots who between them had zero experience fl ying large Boeing airliners? I think not. In fact, the very notion is absurd. There was no certainty that Hani Hanjour and the others would even be able to locate the buildings, let alone hit them on the fi rst attempt.

In fact, the plan was so complex that the chances for success were rather low, that is, without expert assistance. Obviously, the terrorists needed help to complete their suicide mission — a great deal of it. We are compelled to ask: What kinds of assistance were the insiders prepared to deliver? How did they insure the success of the operations? Above all: How was it all done? 3 Investigative writer Daniel Hopsicker spent many months in Venice tracking down various parts of the story that never made it into the offi cial account. According to Hopsicker, Atta and al-Shehhi were also enrolled at Professional Aviation, a fl ight school at Charlotte County Airport, located near Punta Gorda, which is just down the road from Venice. Hopsicker also found evidence of a long history of CIA activity in Punta Gorda and thinks Atta’s sojourn in Charlotte County was dropped from the offi cial narrative for this reason. We also know that Atta and al-Shehhi checked out the Airman Flight School in Norman, Oklahoma, but chose not to enroll.

On June 1, 2001 the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff issued a new order that changed offi cial policy in cases of aircraft piracy, i.e., hijackings. The new order (CJCSI 3610.01A), signed by Vice Admiral S.A. Fry, Director of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, replaced the existing order (CJCSI 3610.01), which had been in effect since July 1997. When I learned about this, I was immediately intrigued. The date, just three months prior to 9/11, suggested more than mere coincidence. The June 2001 order was like a red fl ag shouting an insistent question: Why did the U.S. military alter its hijack policy just a few months before 9/11? It is a fair question. Why, indeed? When I fi rst examined the document, which, by the way, is still posted on the Internet, my excitement increased.1 The June 2001 order states that when hijackings occur, the military’s operational commanders at the Pentagon and at the North American Aerospace Command (NORAD) must contact the offi ce of the Secretary of Defense for approval and further instruction. At the time, of course, this meant Donald Rumsfeld. Was this new order evidence of a policy change made for the purpose of engineering a stand-down on 9/11? This seemed plausible, assuming that a group of evildoers within the Bush administration wanted a terrorist plot to succeed for their own twisted reasons. And what might those reasons be? Well, just possibly, to create the pretext for a much more aggressive U.S. foreign policy, one that the American people would not otherwise support. On the other hand, would the Joint Chiefs be so naive as to effect a standdown on 9/11 by means of an ordinary administrative memo, thus leaving a paper trail to the crime of the century? Several prominent 9/11 investigators evidently thought so. One of them was Jim Marrs, an accomplished journalist, who discusses the June 1, 2001 Pentagon order in his excellent book, The Terror Conspiracy.2 Filmmaker Dylan Avery was another.

Fortunately, the previous July 1997 order is also available for download via the Internet.5 Close inspection of the two documents, side by side, shows that the previous order also required notifi cation of the offi ce of the Secretary of Defense in cases of hijackings. In fact, there was almost no change in the language on this point. It would appear that the basic policy remained in effect, and can be summarized as follows: Although operational commanders have the authority to make decisions of the moment in cases of hijackings, they are also required to notify the offi ce of the Secretary of Defense, who must be kept in the loop and who may chose to intervene at any time. Side by side, the two documents are almost identical. But there is one difference. The new order includes an extra passage in the policy section that mentions two new kinds of airborne vehicles, “unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs)” and “remotely operated vehicles (ROVs).” The order states that, henceforth, these are to be regarded as “a potential threat to public safety.” But why would two new categories of aerial vehicles require the drafting of a new order, especially since the basic policy did not change? I puzzled over this for some time, until I stumbled upon a news story about the Global Hawk, which prompted further investigations and ultimately convinced me that the June 1, 2001 Pentagon order may indeed offer a clue about what happened on September 11, 2001. The answer is not obvious. The technology I will now describe certainly was not on my radar screen. Like most Americans, I went about my affairs over the course of years blithely unaware that technological advances were altering our world beyond recognition. While it is certainly true that new technologies hold amazing potentials to improve our lives and free us from drudgery, make no mistake, they can just as easily enslave us. Nor is it likely that technology’s most hopeful possibilities will be realized so long as its cutting edge remains shrouded in secrecy for “reasons of national security,” a phrase that in my view is one of the most abused expressions in our language.

But I will go even further: If ordinary citizens do not soon awaken to the insidious dangers that new technologies pose to our freedoms, the faceless individuals and nameless puppeteers who command these technologies will succeed in imposing their hidden agendas upon us. In that case, the experiment in self-government that began with the drafting of the U.S. Constitution more than 200 years ago will have reached a dark end. History will come to view us in the same way that we currently look upon the democracies of ancient Greece, i.e., as just another of humanity’s great-but-failed experiments. Here, I would add a further point: In his important book Nemesis, The Last Days of the American Republic, Chalmers Johnson, an expert on Japan and U.S. foreign policy, claims that as much as 40% of the Pentagon budget is “black,” meaning: hidden from public scrutiny. 6 If the fi gure is accurate, it makes my point. On April 23, 2001, just weeks before the Pentagon issued the new hijack order, an unmanned aircraft, the RQ-4A U.S. Global Hawk, completed its maiden 7,500 mile fl ight from Edwards AFB in southern California to Edinburgh AFB in South Australia. 7The nonstop 8,600 mile passage across the Pacifi c took just 22 hours and set an endurance record for an unmanned vehicle. The drone returned to California in early June, after a dozen joint exercises with the Australian military. The previous year, the Global Hawk had made a similar transatlantic run to Europe, where it participated in NATO exercises. You might be thinking: OK, but so what — what is the big deal with the Global Hawk? How does it relate to 9/11? I will answer the second question in a moment. Rod Smith, the Australian Global Hawk manager, answered the fi rst when he said, “The aircraft essentially fl ies itself … from takeoff, right through to landing, and even taxiing off the runway.”8 The drone follows a preprogrammed fl ight plan, although ground controllers constantly monitor it and ultimately remain in control. The jet-powered craft is 44 feet long, has the wingspan of a Boeing 737, and can remain aloft for 42 hours. It fl ies at extremely high altitudes, up to 65,000 feet, and has a range of 14,000 nautical miles. The Global Hawk is aptly named — the bird truly has a global reach.

Its cruising speed is nothing special, about 400 mph , but its ability to reconnoiter vast areas of geography is remarkable. In a single fl ight, the drone can surveil an area the size of Illinois: more than 50,000 square miles. It comes equipped with advanced radar, infrared and electro-optical sensors, which combined can return up to 1,900 high-resolution images during a single fl ight. These are impressive specs by any standard. The U.S. military wasted no time putting the Global Hawk to work gathering intelligence. The bird fl ew during Operation Enduring Freedom, Bush’s October 2001 invasion of Afghanistan, and subsequently saw wide use in Iraq. During one year alone, Global Hawk drones fl ew at least 50 combat missions over Iraq and Afghanistan and logged 1,000 hours of fl ight time. By the way, during the summer of 2006, the Israelis used similar technology during their aerial campaign against Lebanon. In fact, it was they who pioneered the use of surveillance drones during a previous (1982) invasion of their northern neighbor. The U.S. fi rst used drones the following year, when Ronald Reagan ordered the invasion of Grenada, a small island nation in the Caribbean. According to various reports, Global Hawk surveillance of Iran is ongoing. Development of the Global Hawk began in 1995, with the fi rst air trials in 1998 at Edwards AFB. However, the technology is much older. In his fi lm Loose Change 2nd Edition Dylan Avery included a video segment from a NASA test fl ight carried out in 1984, also at Edwards AFB. During the 16-hour exercise, ground pilots remotely controlled a Boeing 720, guiding it through 10 successful takeoffs, numerous approaches, and 13 landings. The test ended with a pre-planned crash. The Pentagon’s use of drones for target practice during war games has been routine for many years. In fact, there is ample evidence that the U.S. military fi rst experimented with remote-controlled aircraft as early as World War II. At the time, the U.S. air command was suffering heavy losses over Germanoccupied Europe as a result of intense fl ak barrages. It was hoped that the introduction of remote-controlled bombers would stem the losses by reducing the exposure of air crews to withering German anti-aircraft fi re. The experiments involved B-17s and B-24s packed with explosives — known as “Weary Willies.” The air crew would take off, then bail out after a chase plane took over control.

The crew in the chase plane would then guide the unmanned bomber, essentially a fl ying bomb, into its target. The experimental program failed however. Weary Willies were ineffective weapons because they fl ew very slowly, and thus were easy targets. The missions were also extremely hazardous. One of them cost the life of the elder brother of President John F. Kennedy. Lt. Joseph P. Kennedy Jr. was piloting one of the converted bombers when the aircraft, loaded with ordnance, exploded prematurely.9 The program was scrapped in 1944. However, after the war the U.S. resumed ROV research, and in the 1950s made rapid progress with radio-controlled planes. As we are about to learn, even greater strides apparently were made during in the 1970s. In late September 2001, a few weeks after the World Trade Center attack, George W. Bush mentioned ROV technology during some comments to the press. The president was passing through Chicago’s O’Hare International Airport and paused to discuss airline safety. According to the New York Times, Bush mentioned that his administration was considering several measures, including federal grants for stronger cockpit doors and new transponders that cannot be turned off. Bush also talked about installing video cameras so that pilots could monitor the passenger section of commercial jetliners.10 Then, Bush said, We will look at all kinds of technologies to make sure that our airlines are safe, including technology to enable controllers to take over a distressed aircraft and land it by remote control. 11Bush implied that this helpful technology belonged to the future. However, there is strong evidence it already existed at the time he spoke — and even before 9/11. A few days after his press briefi ng, the Raytheon Corporation announced that on August 25, 2001, “a government-industry team had accomplished the fi rst precision approach by a civil aircraft using a military Global Positioning System (GPS) landing system.” During three months of trials, Raytheon and the U.S. Air Force had conducted a series of experiments at Holloman AFB, New Mexico. The test fl ights involved a Fed-Ex Express Boeing 727-200 equipped with a RockwellCollins GNLU-930 Multi-Mode Receiver. Raytheon’s contribution was a military GPS ground station developed under a U.S. Air Force contract, involving a Joint Precision Approach and Landings System (JPALS) program.12 The auto-landing followed a series of sixteen successful approaches, during which the aircraft was guided by the JPALS ground station.

According to Fed-Ex spokesperson Steve Kuhar, a senior technical advisor: “… the consistency of the approaches allowed us to proceed to actual auto-landings with very little delay.” The press release boasted that “Raytheon is the world leader in designing and building satellite-based navigation and landing solutions for civil and military applications.” The date of the successful auto-landing was two weeks before the September 11 attack. Nor is this the only case. Other high-tech fi rms also do similar research. In fact, after the 9/11 attack there was a considerable amount of discussion within the industry about new civilian ROV applications. For example, soon after September 11, Tom Cassidy, president and CEO of General Atomics Aeronautical Systems, sent Transportation Secretary Norman Mineta a letter in which he discussed the feasibility of using remote control technology to prevent future acts of terrorism. 13Cassidy’s fi rm developed the Predator, a remote-controlled reconnaissance and attack plane which has been in use by the U.S. Air Force since 1994. The Predator is a distant cousin of the Global Hawk. Cassidy informed Mineta that it would not be diffi cult to adapt the same technology for commercial aircraft: One small high-tech Arizona company named KinetX went so far as to submit a serious proposal to the Federal Aviation Administration for just such a system. The Tempe-based KinetX developed its proposal in concert with another Arizona fi rm named Cogitek. In a white paper the two companies claimed that their National Flight Emergency Response System (NFERS), as they called it, would prevent future 9/11-style hijackings. They insisted that a prototype could be up and running within a year. The white paper described NFERS as “the integration of existing technology for the purpose of transferring cockpit operations to a secure ground station in case of an emergency.” The paper stated, “It is important to note that the essential technology exists now” [my emphasis].14 In 2006, Dr. Lyman Hazelton, chief scientist at KinetX, posted aditional details about the NFERS system on a web blog dedicated to security issues. Hazelton explained that NFERS “uses strong crypto, a command-able autopilot in a physically secured section of the aircraft, and the IRIDIUM satellite phone system (which we helped to design and are still working on now). ^( ∘ 15)He then added, “We tried hard to think through the security process for the system, and The FAA never responded to their proposal, however, according to the KinetX website.

In January 2006 the Boeing company announced a patent for similar technology. 16Boeing’s “auto-land system” reportedly involves an onboard processor. Once activated, it overrides the cockpit controls and guides a hijacked plane to an emergency landing. The system can be preprogramed into the plane’s autopilot, or operated remotely by ground controllers. It can be activated in several different ways: either directly by the pilot during a hijacking-in-progress; or indirectly by sensors installed in the cockpit door, which would be tripped by forcible entry; or, lastly, by ground controllers via a remote link. At issue, is whether Boeing’s auto-land system was truly a new development in 2006. Or did the aircraft giant merely pull preexisting hardware off the shelf, as KinetX had proposed in 2001 with its NFERS system? The Pentagon’s June 1, 2001 order strongly suggests that, from the standpoint of the U.S. military, ROV technology had come of age by the spring of 2001, several months before 9/11. Curiously, in 2008 Secretary of Defense Robert Gates confi rmed as much during an address to the Air University, in which he mentioned that “we now have more than 5,000 UAVs [Unmanned Aerial vehicles], a 25-fold increase since 2001.”17 We need to ask: When was the last time that the U.S. military developed a new technology after private industry, or even simultaneously? It is well known that military research & development programs always receive the best available resources, funding, and expertise. For this reason the military almost always leads the way in technology, usually by at least ten years, sometimes by much more. The emergence of the Internet is an obvious example. As we know, the U.S. military developed cyberspace many years before the Internet exploded into the civilian sector. Does it not stand to reason that ROV technology also followed a similar development path? All of which raises disturbing questions. Did George W. Bush wander off his crib sheet in late September 2001 in his remarks to the press about aircraft safety? Did the president blunder when he mentioned ROV technology in the same breath with 9/11? One does not need a Ph.D. in rocket science to know that what holds for the goose is also true for the gander.

Obviously, the same ROV technology designed to foil hijackers might also be used to commit acts of terrorism, i.e., to fl y planes into tall buildings. It just depends on who is at the controls. It’s tempting to wonder how much (or how little) George W. Bush knew (and presently knows) about September 11. It’s a fair question, and here is another: Did Bush unwittingly come within a whisker of giving the game away? According to the late aeronautical engineer, Joe Vialls, the technology to capture planes via remote control has been around a very long time. If Vialls is correct, the U.S. military developed ROV technology as far back as the mid-1970s, in response to a sharp upsurge in terrorist hijackings during this period. The goal of the project, which, according to Vialls, involved two American multinationals in collaboration with the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), was to facilitate the remote recovery of hijacked American aircraft. Vialls claimed that the effort succeeded brilliantly in developing the means: fi rst, to listen in on cockpit conversations in a target aircraft; and, second, to take absolute control of the plane’s computerized fl ight control system through a remote channel. The aim was to cut the hijackers out of the control loop while empowering ground controllers to return a hijacked plane to a chosen airport, where police would deal with the terrorists. To be truly effective, however, the new technology “had to be completely integrated with all onboard systems,” which could only be achieved by incorporating the system into a new aircraft design. According to Vialls, this is exactly what happened. A high-level decision was made, and Boeing quietly included a “back door” into the computer designs for its 767 and 757 commercial jetliners, which at the time were still on the drawing boards. Both planes went into production in the early 1980s. Vialls shocked even Internet users when he posted all of this on his website in October 2001.18 He contended that the system, although designed for the best of intentions, fell prey to a security leak. Somehow the secret computer code fell into the hands of evildoers within the Bush administration, who surreptitiously used the remote channel on 9/11. Thus armed with the secret codes, the perpetrators easily activated the hidden channel built into the transponders and simply took over the fl ight controls. Whether or not the alleged nineteen hijackers were actually on board remained uncertain. But the issue clearly was of secondary importance, since the jihadists were not fl ying the planes.

Whether or not the alleged nineteen hijackers were actually on board remained uncertain. But the issue clearly was of secondary importance, since the jihadists were not fl ying the planes. Vialls cited evidence in support of his thesis. Crucially, not one of the eight commercial pilots and copilots aboard the four allegedly hijacked planes on 9/11 sent the standard signal alerting FAA authorities that a hijacking was in progress. 19Sending this signal, or “squawking,” as it is called, takes only a few seconds and is done by activating a cockpit device known as an ELT (emergency locator transmitter). A pilot simply keys-in a four-digit code — 7500 − and the letters ”HIJK” fl ash on a screen at ground control. The fact that not even one of the pilots or copilots managed to transmit this standard SOS on 9/11 was suspicious: the fi rst indication to Vialls that the planes were being fl own by some remote means. Another clue was the near total loss of radio contact. Although an electronic failure can disrupt the radio link between a pilot and ground control, this would not explain the loss of radio contact in three out of four planes. Vialls concluded that the pilots lost the ability to transmit after the evildoers commandeered the transponders. Additional evidence turned up in a video of the last seconds of Flight 175, which had been briefl y posted on the Internet. According to Vialls, the footage was anomalous because it showed the plane executing a steep diving maneuver during its fi nal approach that exceeded the normal software limitations of a 767. Boeing jets are designed with liability concerns in mind, as well as passenger safety. Flight control software prevents a pilot from making steep turns that pull substantial “G” forces. Such turns run the risk of injuring passengers, especially the aged and infi rm, which can result in costly lawsuits. This was strong evidence — Vialls argued — that the plane was under remote control. Debunkers had a fi eld day trying to discredit Vialls and his remote control scenario. What is truly surprising is that, many years later, his ideas continue to have traction despite the debunkers, whose more thoughtful criticisms I will now discuss. Some of them pointed out that the fl ight controls on Boeing 767s and 757s, while fully computerized, are not fl y-by-wire designs like some newer planes, including the Global Hawk.

On the contrary, they are mechanical beasts with hydraulically assisted cable and pulley controls. For this reason, these critics assert, a Boeing pilot always has the option of “turning off” the autopilot and fl ying manually.20 One anonymous critic who claimed to be a Boeing maintenance technician argued that even in the worst case, a 757 or 767 pilot could simply pull the electrical breakers, shutting down the power supply to the onboard computers. This would allow him to regain control and fl y the old fashioned way, that is, by the seat of his pants, though, no doubt, with considerably more diffi culty. Such criticisms, I fully acknowledge, are plausible and may even be correct. The problem is that under the circumstances it is impossible to evaluate them without additional information. Unfortunately, short of hacking into Boeing’s corporate fi les there is no way to determine whether the company engineered a hidden override system into its 767s and 757s. Nor can Vialls help us, because, unfortunately, he died in 2005. The story has a no less intriguing sequel. Vialls also contended that in the 1990s, offi cials at Lufthansa airlines made a shocking discovery. By chance, after taking delivery of a fl eet of Boeing jetliners, they stumbled upon the hidden ROV system, at which point, because of the obvious security concerns, Lufthansa went to considerable trouble and expense to remove the original fl ight control system and replace it with one of German design. As far as I know, this story remains unconfi rmed. But neither has it been discredited, and there is yet another twist. In 2003 Andreas von Buelow, a former minister of research and technology in the German government, authored a book, Die CIA und der 11. September. Internationaler Terror und die Rolle der Geheimdienste (The CIA and September 11: International terrorism and the role of secret services [Piper Verlag, Munich]), in which he discussed Joe Vialls’ remote control theory while calling for a new 9/11 investigation. In his book, von Buelow made a stunning charge of his own. Von Buelow claimed that the 9/11 attack was not the work of Islamic extremists, but was an inside job orchestrated by the CIA. As a former high offi cial in the German defense ministry, was Von Buelow privy to the details about Lufthansa’s experience with Boeing? At the present, unfortunately, there are many more questions than answers.

For this reason, I call on Lufthansa and Boeing to come to our assistance by disclosing their corporate records to an independent team of inspectors. I would add that von Buelow has not backed away from the controversial opinions expressed in his book. In radio interviews he has argued that the “hijacked” planes on 9/11 were most likely guided by some form of remote control. He thinks 9/11 was a covert operation carried out by a small group within the U.S. intelligence community, numbering fewer than 50 people.21 Other critics came at Vialls from a different direction. They claimed that potential 9/11 conspirators would never use ROV technology because of the so called latency period issue. They pointed out that fl ying planes by remote control involves a troublesome time delay, which makes precision fl ying diffi cult if not impossible.22 These critics typically cite the astronomical accident rate for drone aircraft, which is 100 times higher than for manned planes. Take, for instance, the Predator, as noted, a cousin of the Global Hawk. Out of 135 of these unmanned surveillance-and-attack planes delivered and used in military operations, at least 50 have crashed, and 34 others have suffered serious accidents. 23Such numbers do not inspire confi dence, and on this basis critics argued that any 9/11 perpetrators within the U.S. government would have instantly rejected ROV technology out of hand as far too unreliable. The above argument sounds plausible, but is easily refuted. A look at the specifi cations for the Global Hawk shows that there are two very different ways to remotely control an aircraft, only one of which involves a time delay. The fi rst is by means of a remote link, e.g., a communications satellite, which does indeed involve a latency period. The second method, however, is direct line-of-sight, which involves no such delay. Evildoers determined to fl y planes into the World Trade Center might, therefore, have overcome the latency period issue by setting up a local command center, for example in WTC-7. Rooftop cameras or other equipment might also have been employed to provide a realtime video feed. Once the local controllers established visual contact, they might have switched from the remote link to line-of-sight. After which, guiding the planes into the towers would have been a simple matter. The fi nal approach was the only portion of the fl ight where “slop” in the controls would have mattered. In March 2007, after I posted the above analysis on the Internet, I heard from a pilot with more than 45 years fl ying experience.

In March 2007, after I posted the above analysis on the Internet, I heard from a pilot with more than 45 years fl ying experience. He wrote, “If there truly is a back door and a remote control operation is possible, then it would be a simple matter to have remotely done 9/11.” According to this pilot, a simple transmitter in a window of each tower, or on the roof, would have provided all of the necessary guidance for a “routine autopilot coupled approach.” 24In fact, the autopilots on today’s airliners are so advanced that pilots seldom touch the controls. A Boeing autopilot, offi cially termed the “fl ight director,” is perfectly capable of fl ying a commercial airliner from take-off to landing. According to pilot and former air traffi c controller Robin Hordon: … when a commercial jet approaches its destination, the fl ight director interfaces with transmitters located at the end of a runway and makes the adjustments. All the pilots have to do is sit back, monitor the controls, and watch the airplane land itself, even in zero-zero conditions [i.e., zero visibility due to fog or stormy weather].25 In June 2007, Hordon delivered an address to a Vancouver, BC 9/11 truth conference about a range of issues, including remote control technology. Although Hordon does not necessarily agree that it was used on 9/11, he admits it is a possibility. Said Hordon, “Could an aircraft be remotely controlled in fl ight right now? Absolutely. In a heartbeat. Because the technology is there.”26 Curiously, at the time of the 1993 World Trade Center bombing, dozens of workers fl ed heavy smoke by climbing to the roof, where they were rescued by police helicopters. But no such exodus to safety occurred on 9/11. Many people trapped on the upper fl oors did try to reach the roof, however they could not because they found the doors locked. We know this from cell phone calls made by frantic victims. One can imagine their horror, after fl eeing toxic smoke, heat and fl ames, only to discover that there would be no escape. Surely at that point, hundreds of trapped souls must have known they were doomed. In their 2003 book City in the Sky, authors James Glanz and Eric Lipton state that the lockeddoor policy went into effect shortly after the 1993 bombing.

In their 2003 book City in the Sky, authors James Glanz and Eric Lipton state that the lockeddoor policy went into effect shortly after the 1993 bombing. For a variety of reasons, the Port Authority had decided, with the agreement of the Fire Department, to discourage the use of helicopters in emergencies at the building. Ordinary building occupants were never briefed on the policy change after 1993, and there were no signs explaining that the doors were locked, although the Port Authority’s emergency drills directed people down the stairs, not up … ”27 The 9/11 Commission Report, released in July 2004, affi rms all of this, and also mentions that the doors were locked “for security reasons.” But it offers no further details. 28Questions remain, because there is reason to think the people trapped in the South Tower should have been able to reach the roof despite the policy. While the North Tower was famous for its 107th fl oor restaurant, Windows on the World, the South Tower had its own popular tourist attraction. Known as “Top of the World,” it featured the highest observation deck in America, allowing a unique 360-degree panoramic vista of New York City and environs. 29Weather permitting, tourists could also ride an escalator from the enclosed 107th fl oor deck to an outdoor viewing platform mounted on the roof. Photos confi rm that a fl ood of tourists indeed visited the WTC roof nearly every day. There were also shops on the 107th fl oor that catered to tourists. The offi cial investigation never explained why WTC security personnel, who surely had keys to the open air platform, failed to use them on 9/11. The offi cial report makes no mention of any of this. Assuming that 9/11 was an inside job, the locked-door policy obviously was convenient for the perpetrators. The abandoned helicopter rescue system also eliminated any chance that survivors would live to tell stories about bombs exploding in the core of the buildings. Due to the smoke and heat, helicopter rescue would have been diffi cult, but not impossible. This might even explain the demolition of WTC-7, assuming the building housed the local command center. Such an operation would have involved a substantial amount of incriminating hardware which could not be removed after the fact without running grave risks. It would have been much safer, from the standpoint of the perpetrators, to destroy the evidence by “pulling ； Building 7.

The title of the premiere was “Scenario 12-D.” The show was fi ctitious: about a strange military exercise gone awry, but it was no less prophetic. In the story a faction within the U.S. government stages a phony terrorist attack for the purpose of provoking a U.S. military response abroad. The deeper reason, as the riveting dialogue makes clear, is because “the arms market is fl at.” Evidently, a powerful sub-group of industrialists and their co-conspirators within government view false-fl ag terrorist operations as a perfectly acceptable means for priming the economic pump, thus driving up arms production and sales. Need I mention that, in the real world, the profi ts generated by this particular industry are exceeded only by the illegal drug trade? And what is the act of “terrorism?” Why, the very thing we have been discussing! Using remote access, the evildoers commandeer a Boeing 727 during a commercial fl ight over the northeastern United States. (Notice, this was the same model used by Raytheon in the remote tests later that year.) Of course, the controllers are safely on the ground. In one scene we see them huddled around a lap-top computer in a dimly-lit room, in the process of busily steering the plane toward — you guessed it — the World Trade Center! For maximum effect, we are informed that the airliner is fully loaded with 110 passengers and is carrying 16,000 gallons of jet fuel. The tension mounts as the derelict plane moves closer to its doom. The pilot orders the electrical power cut, then calmly warns the unsuspecting passengers to return to their seats and fasten their seat belts. (As if this would make any difference.) Meanwhile, his crew struggles to regain control of the ship. At the last instant the pilot achieves a manual override and pulls up the nose— just in time to miss the South Tower by inches. In one scene we are even shown a graphic of the fl ight path, which, believe it or not, is almost identical to the fi nal approach of Flight 175.

Did someone “on the inside” leak the planned attack to a confi dante in Hollywood? How else would the producer know the shape of 28 The 9/11 Commission Report: Final Report of the National Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States, W.W. Norton & Co., New York, 2004, pp. 279-281, 294, 317. The report states that a “lock release order” was issued at 9:30 A.M., which would have unlocked all areas in the complex controlled by the WTC’s computerized security system, including the doors to the roof. The order was never executed however. Why not? According to the report, because of “damage to the software controlling the system, resulting from the impact of the plane.” Of course, assuming perpetrators had planted explosives, they must have had access to the WTC security system, including the computers, which they surely would have disabled as a part of their plan. At the end of the Cold War, the peoples of the earth shared a rare moment of history. The United Sates stood alone as the sole planetary superpower. The American star which had been rising since the Second World War reached its apogee. For whatever reason, it seemed that destiny had selected the United States for a special role: to guide the community of nations into a period of unparalleled peace and prosperity. With the fading of East-West tensions this and much more seemed within reach. For a brief time, it did appear that almost anything was possible. And why not? After all, the United States faced no serious military rivals. The U.S. dollar was the favored currency in international exchange, and had been for decades. English was the lingua franca of science, diplomacy and commerce. Most of the world acknowledged U.S. leadership. Ameri- can culture was widely imitated. All of this, taken together, was unprecedented. Never in history had one nation achieved this much global infl uence. America had both the prestige and the power to shape the future of humanity, for better or ill. The world was desperate for a new vision. This was true for many reasons, but primarily because the titanic struggle between capitalism and Communism had been so destructive.

This was true for many reasons, but primarily because the titanic struggle between capitalism and Communism had been so destructive. The forty-fi ve-year Cold War had been waged on many fronts and in the most improbable places. It was an ideological war, not a clash of civilizations. As the vying spheres of infl uence ebbed and fl owed across the continents, numerous nations were drawn in. Proxy wars raged along the tectonic margins and at the friction points where East and West collided. Neither side could defeat the other militarily without destroying itself, because the epic struggle was governed by a mad doctrine: Mutually Assured Destruction (MAD). It was a fi tting acronym for an insane time. It was also a cruel paradox. For decades, the world, rigged to a trip wire, could neither stand still nor move forward. The added rub, which I believe most people sensed intuitively, was that the precarious balancing act could not be sustained indefi nitely. Of course, looking back, it is clear that the Cold War itself, I mean the idea of the Cold War, was a carefully cultivated illusion: a false reality. But that is another story. 1 Certainly the consequences were real enough. Citizens of the planet who lived through the period know what it means to live wedged between impossible alternatives — the unthinkable on one hand and the unendurable on the other. Millions were crushed beneath these wheels. Indeed, some nations were utterly destroyed beyond hope of recovery. The list of victims is long, and includes Afghanistan, Angola, Cambodia, Chile, the Dominican Republic, Haiti, East Timor, Ethiopia, Granada, Guatemala, Honduras, Indonesia, Laos, Mozambique, Nicaragua, Panama, Somalia, Sudan, and Viet Nam. No doubt there are others … Even as the Cold War trampled on the rights of indigenous people everywhere, it despoiled the global environment. Toxic mayhem on a vast scale accompanied the nuclear arms race. Entire regions were affected, and many were ruined or left permanently scarred. The open wounds from the heyday of uranium mining still deface the landscapes of the American southwest. Navaho children still play on the tailing piles, amidst the radioactive dust left behind by soulless corporations that appeared on the scene, eager to make a fast buck, boomed briefl y, then disappeared or were swallowed, in turn, by still larger corporations with even less of a conscience. Even worse scars can be found in the former Soviet republics, where whole provinces were poisoned by catastrophic accidents at Sverdlovsk and Chernobyl, and entire ecosystems, such as the Aral Sea region, were despoiled by central planning gone amok.

By any measure, the toll of the Cold War was incalculable, and it is no wonder that when the corrupt old Soviet state fi nally collapsed, the world’s response was “good riddance!” The dismantling of the Iron Curtain was attended by joyous celebration in Europe. For a brief time, hope soared. Here in the U.S., there was even talk of a peace dividend. Have we forgotten? Everywhere people dared to believe that the victory of the West presaged a new era of international cooperation, now desperately needed to address a long list of pressing global problems, among them Third World poverty, overpopulation, the challenge of sustainable development, the energy crisis, AIDs, and the environment. Most importantly, at long last real progress toward nuclear disarmament was fi nally within reach. All eyes at this moment turned to the West and especially to Washington for leadership. Yet it is now painfully obvious, and has been for most of George W. Bush’s presidency, that humanity’s once high hopes have been dashed. All that remains is the question: How did this happen? It is a diffi cult question, admittedly, but if we are ever to fi nd our way back and regain a measure of hope, I believe we must face it honestly. Today, many Americans hold G.W. Bush personally responsible for the wars in Iraq, Afghanistan and elsewhere that have caused America’s increasing isolation in the world. Many also blame Bush for the sinking dollar, the deepening economic crisis and the general decline in our fortunes. While I am no friend of the Bush administration, I do not entirely agree with this view, because I take issue with those who still naively believe in a partisan solution. The truth is more complex. In fact, the previous Democratic administration of William Jefferson Clinton bears a large measure of responsibility for the disasters that have befallen us. In many ways the Clinton White House set the stage for George W. Bush. Dr. Helen Caldicott, the tireless campaigner against nuclear oblivion, writes that she got the wake-up call about Clinton in 1999, when she was invited to attend a meeting in Florida about the weaponization of space. Caldicott was aghast as she listened to knowledgeable individuals describe current U.S. military planning for space. Like many of us, she had trusted Bill Clinton, and naively believed he was taking care of the nation’s business.

Suddenly, Caldicott realized she had been living in a fool’s paradise: To my horror I found that seventy-fi ve military industrial corporations such as Lockheed Martin, Boeing, Raytheon, TRW Aerojet, Hughes Space, Sparta Corp, and Vista Technologies had produced a Long Range Plan, written with the cooperation of the U.S. Space Command, announcing a declaration of U.S. space leadership and calling for the funding of defensive system and “a seamlessly integrated force of theatre land, sea, air and space capabilities through a world-wide global defense information network.” The U.S. Space Command would also “hold at risk” a fi nite number of “high-value” earth targets with near instantaneous force application — the ability to kill from space…. I also discovered that the much-vaunted missile defense system was to be closely integrated with the weaponization of space, and that all of the hardware and software would be made by the same fi rms, at the combined cost of hundreds of billions of dollars to the U.S. taxpayers.2 The plan envisaged “full spectrum dominance,” that is, U.S. military domination of land, sea, air and space. Although U.S. planners sought to portray this next generation of technological wizardry as defensive, in actuality, the planned systems, if implemented, amounted to a major break with the 1972 ABM Treaty and with longstanding U.S. commitments to maintain the peaceful status of outer space. The cold hard logic of dominance meant that the project was offensive in nature. But why? Exactly who was to be targeted? Which enemies? Remember, this was 1999. The Cold War was over and had been for years. It was obvious to Caldicott that a precious opportunity was being squandered, perhaps forever. The new space weapons threatened to trigger a new global arms race and, very likely, another cycle of world confl ict. Caldicott writes that she staggered home from the meeting determined “to become re-involved in educating the public about the impending catastrophe associated with the mad plans of the U.S. Space Command and its associated corporations …” The point is that not even one of the new weapons systems being planned was needed. In fact, the grand plan for space, if implemented, would have benefi ted no one but a few arms manufacturers and, of course, the bankers who fi nance such deranged schemes — all at immense cost to the U.S. taxpayer.

As I’ve noted, the end of the Cold War presented America and the world with a golden opportunity to move in a new direction, one that, in fact, was essential for the survival of our planetary civilization. As a younger man, I was a great admirer of the late inventor R. Buckminster Fuller. He is probably best known for the geodesic dome, but Fuller also popularized the notion of the “critical path,” an expression used by engineers, and one that means exactly what it suggests.3 The idea is that if we are to become sustainable on “spaceship earth” and avoid destroying our planetary home, we must learn to live within the physical limitations or budget imposed by Nature. This requires that we drastically reduce our human “footprint” by becoming much more effi cient in the way we use energy and natural resources. Fuller was a fi rm believer in human ingenuity, and he often argued that our predicament called for a designer revolution on various levels, both economic and social. None of the steps in the critical path are optional, from the standpoint of survival. Taken together, they should be understood as the minimum requirements necessary for the long-term success of the human enterprise. While experts often disagree, at the end of the Cold War the single most urgent step in the critical path should have been obvious to every thinking person, including the newly elected President Bill Clinton, who entered the White House in 1992 on a wave of high hopes. As the fi rst Democratic U.S. president to be inaugurated in the postCold War era, Bill Clinton’s number one priority should have been to meet with our Russian neighbors at an early date, and to negotiate with them a mutual halt in nuclear weapons production and research, as well as a rapid build-down of existing nuclear stockpiles and delivery systems. It was also imperative that Clinton give fi rm direction to the U.S. military. The Pentagon had to be made to understand that because the Cold War was now thankfully over, the nation must chart a new path, one requiring the urgent redeployment of resources away from the nuclear weapons industry.

It was also imperative that Clinton give fi rm direction to the U.S. military. The Pentagon had to be made to understand that because the Cold War was now thankfully over, the nation must chart a new path, one requiring the urgent redeployment of resources away from the nuclear weapons industry. A key part of this redirection would be the announcement of a vital new mission for the national weapons labs (Lawrence, Los Alamos, and Sandia). Henceforth, the labs would cease most weapons-related research/ development and would redirect their considerable talents in a positive direction, the new mission being a Manhattan-scale project to solve the nation’s long-term energy problem. The goal would be to wean America away from its unhealthy dependence on coal and foreign oil. Clinton would instruct the labs to engineer a phased transition toward abundant and clean energy alternatives at the earliest possible date; to make this happen he would press Congress to appropriate the needed funding. Efforts would focus on a range of promising technologies, but especially wind, solar, tidal, and hydrogen. Meanwhile, the nuclear establishment would be stripped of its vast subsidies. Although in a bygone era these may have been justifi ed, the nuclear establishment had failed to produce a long-term energy solution. Indeed, the enormous monies lavished upon it over decades of preferential treatment had succeeded only in creating a bureaucratic dinosaur. The nuclear industry had become a part of the problem itself and was now an impediment to change. Why? Because its enormous subsidies undermined healthy market forces, and were frustrating the development of more promising energy alternatives. Henceforth, nuclear power would have to compete on an equal playing fi eld with solar, hydrogen, wind energy, etc. Another key objective would be to achieve the economies of scale necessary to bring down the costs of clean and renewable alternatives. The project would envision whole new sectors of the economy, greatly enhanced national productivity, boosted foreign earnings, not to mention millions of high-paying new jobs — not offshore but right here in the U.S. Meanwhile, resources would also be redirected to a long list of outstanding social and environmental problems. At the top of the list: the urgent cleanup of the toxic mess created by the nuclear establishment during a profl igate half-century of out-of-control weapons development. This alone would cost an estimated $350 billion (in 1995 dollars, according to the Department of Energy), a whopping fi gure that does not even include the costs associated with cleaning up the mess at the Hanford reservation, the Nevada Test Site, and the Savannah and Clinch nuclear facilities, all so contaminated that a solution may not even be feasible.

Some will argue that the above visionary plan was (and is) unrealistically utopian — too much to expect of any U.S. president, let alone the Clinton White House. But I take strong exception with this viewpoint, because in the 1990s the transition I have described was already within reach. Few major technological breakthroughs were needed. Many of the important alternatives were already “on the shelf” and could have been brought to maturity without undue economic strain. Some, no doubt, would have been mainstream long since but for bureaucratic inertia and because powerful vested interests have actively suppressed them — the same interests, I would add, that have sought to keep America addicted to oil. No, what was needed more than anything was strong leadership in the White House — to beak through the inertial barriers and confront the vested interests. What is the role of a U.S. president, after all, if not to use the power of the offi ce (the “bully pulpit”) to catalyze changes that are needed for the good of the nation as a whole. Indeed, this is precisely why a president must stand above special interests. In the early years of his presidency, Clinton did not lack for popular support. A solid majority of the American people elected him because they wanted change, and they looked to Clinton to make the tough decisions. This is not just my opinion. Numerous commentators have pointed this out. No question, Bill Clinton entered offi ce with tremendous political capital. Yet, incredibly, he never used it. The crucial factor was leadership and he simply failed to deliver. There are various theories as to why. Dr. Caldicott’s frank assessment will make Democrats squirm, but in my opinion it carries the ring of truth. Caldicott thinks Clinton lacks the necessary strength of character, and she has it about right. I would go further, but, again, that is another story. 4 Clinton’s Nuclear Policy Review: A Diminished Presidency? ike other newly elected presidents, Bill Clinton soon ordered a policy review of U.S. nuclear weapons doctrine. The review was of vital importance, and its successful completion required Clinton to become personally involved. This also meant taking charge at the Pentagon as the commander-in-chief. Unfortunately, instead of asserting his authority, Clinton vacillated, as if he were unclear himself about priorities and objectives. Eventually he delegated the nuclear policy review to mid-level offi cials who were easily outmaneuvered by hardliners in the military.

Eventually he delegated the nuclear policy review to mid-level offi cials who were easily outmaneuvered by hardliners in the military. The Pentagon generals opposed any changes in U.S. nuclear policy, and they won a decisive victory. It was a major defeat for Clinton and one from which he never recovered. Caldicott speculates that Clinton thereafter sought to compensate for his loss of standing by using military force abroad on more occasions than any president in two decades. She may be right. Clinton’s subsequent attempts to placate the Pentagon certainly were no substitute for strong leadership, and this probably explains why, even today, Clinton is generally viewed with contempt within the U.S. armed services. Soldiers naturally respect strength and revile weakness. However, Clinton’s diminished presidency did not become evident for some years. Certainly none of this was immediately obvious. At the 1995 Nonproliferation Review Conference, the Clinton administration, to all appearances, achieved a major success by persuading a majority of nations to agree to an indefi nite extension of the Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT). This success was probably due to Clinton’s vocal support for the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT), and because the U.S. delegation agreed to a list of noble principles reaffi rming the U.S. obligation under Article VI of the NPT to take steps in the near future toward complete nuclear disarmament. The world did not then know that Clinton was about to trample on those same principles, by succumbing to a deal with hard-line elements within his own administration. Surely this in itself is an indication of Clinton’s failed leadership, for only a weak president would ever agree to such a back-room deal. What was the deal? The U.S. Department of Energy, representing the national weapons labs, agreed to back Clinton’s support of the Comprehensive Test Ban, but only if Clinton agreed to preserve the labs’ traditional role as nuclear overseers; and this, of course, meant preserving the nuclear arsenal itself. In this way was born the Stockpile Stewardship and Management Program, otherwise known as Manhattan II. Although its stated purpose seemed innocuous enough: to insure the safety and reliability of the U.S. nuclear stockpile, in reality the program was geared to maintain various nuclear research and development programs at roughly Cold War levels for many years into the future. Additionally, the package created new computational and simulation programs to compensate for the anticipated ratifi cation of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. We also know that nuclear research was also allowed to continue at Los Alamos — in secret — a clear violation of the NPT.

We also know that nuclear research was also allowed to continue at Los Alamos — in secret — a clear violation of the NPT. This came to light in 1995, when Dr. Don Wolkerstorfer, a Los Alamos manager, mentioned a new bunker buster, the B-61-11, during a radio debate. 5 (The B-61-11 is a variable-yield nuclear penetrator, maximum yield: 340 kilotons.) The following year, Department of Defense spokesperson Kenneth Bacon revealed that other new earth penetrators were also in the works. Bacon told reporters, “We are now working on a series of weapons, both nuclear and conventional, to deal with deeply buried targets.”6 There are indications the labs were also moving ahead with an even more ambitious program to develop the next generation of nuclear weapons. On April 25, 1997, the physicist Hans Bethe, the most senior surviving scientist from the original Manhattan Project, sent a letter to President Clinton. One day, it may have historic signifi cance. In the letter Bethe urged the president to halt research on new weapons designs, including a pure fusion bomb, long viewed as the Holy Grail of nuclear weapons designers. The great physicist, who headed up the theoretical division at Los Alamos during the development of the atomic bomb, had been retired for years. Yet, Bethe maintained contacts in the labs and so was well informed about the types of research programs that were underway. He informed Clinton that the U.S. already possessed more than suffi cient weaponry for its security, and he urged, … the time has come for our Nation to declare that it is not working, in any way, to develop further weapons of mass destruction of any kind. In particular, this means not fi nancing work looking toward the possibility of new designs for nuclear weapons. And it certainly means not working on new types of nuclear weapons, such as pure-fusion weapons [my emphasis].7 Bethe deserved to be taken seriously. After all, he earned the 1967 Nobel Prize in physics for describing the fusion process that drives the stars. In his letter, Bethe further wrote that because “new types of weapons would, in time, spread to others and present a threat to us, it is logical for us not to pioneer further in this fi eld.” Although the famous physicist affi rmed his support for the stewardship program, Bethe also cautioned that computational experiments could be used to design new categories of weapons, even in the absence of underground testing. He urged Clinton not to fund such programs. This was sage counsel, because it is believed that Israel managed to evade", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:The 9_11 Mystery Plane - Mark H.

He urged Clinton not to fund such programs. This was sage counsel, because it is believed that Israel managed to evade international detection while clandestinely developing nuclear weapons by this very means, i.e., through the use of computational models and computer simulations. Israel has never signed the NPT and is believed to have staged only a very few small nuclear tests — possibly as few as one. 8Yet, the dearth of live testing did not prevent Israel from developing a large and advanced nuclear arsenal. Six weeks later, Clinton sent Bethe a polite reply that deftly side-stepped all of the points the scientist had raised (see endnote 7). Just fi ve months later, in November 1997, Clinton issued a presidential directive, PDD-60, formalizing the outcome of his nuclear policy review. Most of the document remained classifi ed, but more than enough was released to serve notice to the world that the United States was now a far more serious threat to the Nonproliferation Treaty than any terrorist or rogue state. Clinton’s directive fl ew squarely in the face of the noble principles he had agreed to at the 1995 NPT conference. It reaffi rmed the logic of the Cold War and announced a cornucopia of new spending to be showered upon the nuclear establishment over the next two decades. The directive announced that the U.S. would maintain the status quo, namely, the Cold War triad of nuclear forces (i.e., bombers, ICBMs and submarines) as well as the hair-trigger launch-onwarning posture. The U.S. insisted upon the right to nuclear fi rst-use and even the right to use nukes against non-nuclear states that might somehow threaten U.S. “interests.”9 These shocking revelations were unprecedented. The U.S. also rejected a Russian proposal for deeper cuts in the number of strategic warheads. Instead, the U.S. would move ahead with plans to upgrade the U.S. Trident missile force and the B-2 bomber. The U.S. would also resume production of plutonium pits, which are the fi ssile cores used in nuclear weapons. The directive reaffi rmed the new emphasis on sub-critical nuclear testing and advanced computer modeling procedures: the very thing Hans Bethe had cautioned against. Additionally, the U.S. announced that it would resume production of tritium, an isotope of hydrogen used in thermonuclear weapons. The stated purpose was to provide additional supplies for the stewardship program. Because tritium has a half-life of just twelve years, the tritium gas used in nuclear weapons decays and periodically must be replenished. Even so, the explanation was dubious, since tritium can", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:The 9_11 Mystery Plane - Mark H.

Because tritium has a half-life of just twelve years, the tritium gas used in nuclear weapons decays and periodically must be replenished. Even so, the explanation was dubious, since tritium can be scavenged from deactivated weapons and recycled. Given even modest reductions in the size of the U.S. nuclear force, in 1997 there was at least a thirty-year supply of tritium for the stewardship program.10 This hinted that Hans Bethe was correct, and the U.S. was already secretly developing the next generation of nukes. As if all of this were not enough, the directive also announced that the U.S. would complete construction of a brand-new National Ignition Facility (NIF) at the Lawrence Livermore laboratory, where the world’s most powerful lasers would be used to study nuclear fusion — another clue. These policies had been decided with no public debate or consultations with Congress. It certainly now appears that Clinton made a bargain with the devil. Perhaps he acted in the mistaken belief that the muchanticipated ratifi cation of the Comprehensive Test Ban by the U.S. Senate would allow him some fl exibility — a chance to later rescind at least some of his newly announced policies. As we know, of course, things took a rather different turn. In 1998 the Republican-controlled Senate rejected the Test Ban, dealing Clinton another stinging defeat. In any event, it is obvious today that Clinton’s attempts to placate the militarists in his administration backfi red, with the unfortunate result of locking the U.S. into a Cold War posture for many years to come, even though the Cold War was long over. All of which raises serious questions about Bill Clinton’s style of leadership, or lack thereof. Now, with the benefi t of hindsight, it is also evident that Clinton’s character issues were not limited to placating generals. The more fundamental problem was that instead of serving the people who had elected him, Clinton chose to serve a tiny group of very rich and powerful men. Most assuredly, Clinton was looking after their interests in 1999 when he signed a bill repealing the 1933 Glass-Steagall Act.11 The average American knows nothing about this, and probably has never even heard of it, so I will be brief. It is enough to know that Glass-Steagall was enacted during the Great Depression for a sound reason: because in the roaring Ω^(,)20s Wall Street bankers had shown they were incapable of regulating themselves.

GlassSteagall created a regulatory fi rewall that separated commercial banking from Wall Street investment banking and insurance. This eliminated confl icts of interest and other abuses within the banking community. By the 1990s, however, the important fi rewall was under attack from bankers who viewed the New Deal as an aberration. Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan crusaded for deregulation, and during Clinton’s second term he fi nally succeeded.12 Clinton’s signature on the bill repealing Glass-Steagall opened the fl oodgates to the so called securitization revolution, and the result has been a disaster for our nation: derivative schemes as far as the eye can see, wild speculation, a vast real estate bubble, the sub-prime crisis, and pyramids of debt that now saddle the U.S. economy with tens of trillions in liabilities, not to mention the ongoing meltdown of the U.S. dollar. Wall Street banking became a legalized skimming racket, set up to fl eece naive investors who dare to play the game at their own risk. Would a president committed to the best interests of our nation as a whole have signed such a bill? Of course not! For many years during the Cold War, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization had been the fi rst line of defense against a possible Soviet attack on Western Europe. But when the old Soviet state collapsed in the early 1990s during the presidency of Mikhail Gorbachev, NATO’s original purpose also ceased to exist. Later, when the Berlin Wall came down, President George H.W. Bush assured Gorbachev that the U.S. would not expand NATO into eastern Europe, if Russia did not oppose the reunifi cation of Germany. The agreement was mutually benefi cial, and the Russians were true to their word. However, during his second term Clinton reneged on Bush’s promise, by proposing to admit eastern European nations to the NATO alliance, starting with Poland, the Czech Republic, and Hungary. Clinton’s Secretary of State, Madeleine Albright, went on tour promoting the new plan. She argued that NATO expansion was a good idea because it would stabilize central Europe politically and economically. Thoughtful critics, however, such as former Senator Sam Nunn (DGA), a longtime expert on U.S. nuclear policy, begged to differ. Nunn pointed out that because Moscow would naturally view the eastward expansion of NATO as a grave threat to its national security, the probable consequence would be exactly the opposite. Clinton’s plan for NATO would stall progress toward arms reductions, destabilize Europe, and might even lead to a new Cold War.

Clinton’s plan for NATO would stall progress toward arms reductions, destabilize Europe, and might even lead to a new Cold War. Critics also warned that the U.S. taxpayer would likely pick up much of the tab for NATO expansion to the tune of many billions of dollars, most of which would end up in the bank accounts of various arms merchants. Yet, in 1998, with almost no debate, the U.S. Congress closed ranks behind Clinton and voted to support NATO expansion. With hindsight, the critics were correct. Despite facile claims by the Clinton administration to the contrary, the expansion of NATO into eastern Europe was not in the best interests of the United States, nor in the best interests of Europe. At the time, the relatively poor nations of eastern Europe did not have money to waste on U.S. armaments. Their top priority was (or should have been) to improve the quality of life of their people, which meant rebuilding their infrastructure after the disaster of Communism. Of course, Washington promised that in return for purchasing our weapons, the U.S. would support their entry in the European Union (EU), which most of western Europe opposed at the time. Yet, this enticement was an illusion, because their purchase of large quantities of U.S. weapons actually slowed their economic recovery, and this more than anything delayed their entry into the EU. No, the sole benefi ciaries of NATO expansion were the U.S. arms makers and their fi nancial backers on Wall Street, who saw in the breakup of the former Soviet bloc an opportunity to enrich themselves. They can only be compared with the carpetbaggers who infested the southern states after the American Civil War for the purpose of exploiting the defeated Confederacy. The U.S. arms industry, the world’s largest, spent millions successfully lobbying the U.S. Congress and the Clinton administration to expand NATO, and their lobbying paid off handsomely (for them). Subsequently, they cashed in on a vast new arms bazaar. Clinton had already signaled his obeisance to these powerful interests as early as 1995, when he issued Presidential Directive 41, which announced that arms sales were essential for preserving U.S. jobs. The 1995 directive instructed U.S. diplomats to get busy and boost foreign sales of U.S.-made weapons for the good of the U.S. economy. Obviously, Clinton found it easier to maintain the status quo, however perilous for the nation, than use the considerable power of his offi ce to change that reality and move America away from the weapons economy built up during the Cold War.

When Moscow protested the expansion of NATO, Clinton brushed aside Russia’s concerns with characteristic aplomb. The president defended NATO expansion as a force for good. Indeed, his casual demeanor seemed to make light of this quaint Russian idea that NATO might somehow threaten Moscow. How absurd. As the Bush Administration continues preparation to install an antiballistic missile (ABM) system in Poland and a new ABM radar site in the Czech Republic, virtually on Russia’s doorstep, and as we hover on the brink of a wider Gulf war that could easily “go nuclear,” it is crystal clear that Moscow’s concerns about its security were well-founded. The real issue is why Bill Clinton, a Rhodes scholar, was purblind at the time. The fact is that the expansion of NATO was never about the stability of Europe. It was never about U.S. or global security. It was always about one thing: the sale of weapons for profi t. Now, as the world situation deteriorates each day, all of this has become more obvious. But where is the outrage? Why is this key issue not being raised in the political discourse? Have we lost the capacity to distill even the simplest and most obvious lessons from recent history? Are we now witnessing for this reason the terminal phase of America’s “race to the bottom”? Has our political culture been so dumbed down that our nation is beyond redemption? If so, our terminal condition is largely the result of media consolidation, which Bill Clinton also surely hastened by signing the 1996 Telecommunications Act (and, as I recall, amidst much pomp and circumstance). Republican presidential candidate John McCain has declared that the U.S. occupation of Iraq and the “war on terror” will continue for 100 years. Such statements are insane, and obviously so, yet McCain’s prompted no strong rebuke from Democratic leaders Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton. Why not? Is militarism so fashionable that the Democrats are afraid to challenge McCain’s rabid warmongering for fear of being labeled as “weak” or “unpatriotic”?

Why, Hillary? 6 Offi ce of the Assistant Secretary of Defense (Public Affairs), DoD News Briefi ng, Tuesday April 23, 1996. The Clinton administration also sponsored the creation of a closely related military program, the Underground Facility Analysis Center (UFAC), a multi-service “consortium dedicated to detecting, identifying, characterizing and assess- ing for defeat adversarial underground facilities or hardened and deeply buried targets.” For more details see Maj. Mark Easterbrook, “Underground Facility Analysis Center,” Military-geospatial-technology.com, October 18, 2007. Bill Clinton helped prepare the way for the neocon invasion of America. Yet, as we know, a “catalyzing event” separates Clinton from Bush: the earthquake of September 11, 2001, a day so pivotal that we now categorize world history as either pre- or post-9/11. The collapse of the World Trade Center was arguably the most dramatic human- caused catastrophe ever captured on fi lm, and so painful to watch that many of us would rather forget. Many Americans have no doubt tried. But 9/11 was not only a tragedy for America. It was tragic for the planet. The political shift to the right that followed in its wake here in the U.S. also set in motion a polarizing sea-change in world affairs. Other governments copied the U.S. response, citing the “threat of terrorism” as a convenient excuse to curtail civil liberties and crack down on political dissidents. The pattern was global. Additionally, the events themselves were a shared experience, a fact that, in my opinion, many Americans still do not fully appreciate. The same horrifying images circled the earth at the speed of light and ultimately reached an audience of at least several billion people: everyone with access to a television screen. Surely this helps to explain the vast outpouring of sympathy for America following the attack. Condolences came from every direction. In many foreign cities there were spontaneous demonstrations in honor of the victims. In Tehran, for example, thousands of people gathered in the streets for candlelight vigils. An entire stadium of Iranian soccer fans reportedly paused for a moment of respectful silence. These impromptu Iranian acts of commiseration with America are ironic, in retrospect, since Iran is in the cross-hairs — under increasing attack by the Bush administration. Most Americans are probably unaware that in the period immediately following 9/11, the governments of Iran and Syria supplied the Bush administration with intelligence information about terrorism, and in other ways supported the U.S. response to 9/11.

Iran and Syria not only offered to help track down the alleged perpetrators, i.e. Osama bin Laden and the members of al Qaeda, they also made it clear they were prepared to go much further. Both offered major concessions that held the potential to transform the political landscape of the Mideast for the better. Nothing less than a comprehensive regional peace settlement was within reach. Yet I would bet that very few Americans know that these initiatives ever happened, let alone why they failed. But, of course, this is not surprising, since many of the events I will discuss in this chapter went unreported in the U.S. media. Shocking, but true. In fact, the long-troubled U.S.-Iran relationship showed signs of new life before the 9/11 attack. Early in 2001, during the fi rst days of the Bush administration, positive statements by Secretary of State Colin Powell were reciprocated by Iran’s Foreign Minister Kamal Kharrazi. As the diplomats tested the waters, U.S. oil companies waited in the wings, hoping for a breakthrough. Both nations had much to gain from improved relations. But to understand why this is so, we need to review some history. During the 1990s, Iran was still struggling to recover from its bloody war with Saddam Hussein (1980-1988), which ravaged the region and caused great damage to the oil infrastructure in the Gulf. In the aftermath, Iran’s oil exports lagged far behind the years of peak production in the 1970s under the Shah. The resulting economic consequences for the country were severe, because Iran is heavily dependent on foreign earnings from oil. Nor did the U.S. play a helpful role — on the contrary. During the Iran-Iraq war the U.S. had provided arms to both sides — a morally bankrupt policy — and after the war ended, Washington used its considerable infl uence to hinder Iran’s recovery. It did this by discouraging international investment, which Iran desperately needed to return its oil production to pre-war levels. In 1995 President Bill Clinton also punished Iran by imposing formal economic sanctions, a negative policy that largely backfi red, as European and Russian investors moved in to exploit the “vacuum” left by the U.S. $\\scriptstyle { \\underline { { 1 } } } \\mathbf { N o }$ wonder U.S. oil companies chaffed under Clinton’s punitive policy, which put them at a disadvantage. 2The stakes were immense.

At issue were some of the last great oil and gas fi elds on earth awaiting development, located not only within Iran but across a wide swath of Central Asia. Known as the Caspian Sea basin, the region stretches from Azerbaijan in the west to Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan in the east. All of this was up for grabs, and U.S. oil companies wanted their share of the action, which, of course, meant gaining access. A mere glance at a map shows that the most direct and effi cient route for getting oil/gas out of this land-locked region lies through Iran, which at the time already possessed a functioning north-south network of pipelines. The few additional needed spur lines could have been constructed for a small fraction of the cost of the alternative routes through Turkey and Afghanistan, routes favored by the Clinton administration for reasons having to do with domestic politics. U.S. oil companies openly questioned the wisdom of these alternative routes. The line through Turkey, for example, had to pass through the politically unstable Caucasus and also through a portion of the Kurdish homeland. Although it was completed in 2005-2006, the pipeline through Turkey continues to entail serious risks of disruption. Leery investors eventually abandoned the other project through Afghanistan for the same reason. They deemed it much too risky. The facts of geography also explain why Conoco and Mobil lobbied Clinton to waive sanctions — as it happened, unsuccessfully — so that they might reap immense profi ts from lucrative energy swaps. A swap of crude oil or gas might work as follows: Iran would supply oil for export directly from its fi elds in the Persian Gulf while receiving an equivalent amount for its own energy needs from newly developed fi elds in neighboring Turkmenistan or Kazakhstan. ³S waps promised enormous profi ts to investors by eliminating the need to transport oil/gas over great distances. Clinton rejected these proposals. But in 2001 there was every reason to suppose that the newly elected President Bush would cater to them. After all, Bush was an oil man himself, and many offi cials in his administration, such as Condoleezza Rice, came directly from the oil industry. Even Vice President Richard Cheney was on record opposing sanctions, despite his hawkish views. In 1996, while CEO of Halliburton, Cheney called sanctions against Iran “self-defeating.”4 His company was well-positioned to profi t from energy swaps. In fact, at the time Halliburton was already doing business with Iran — violating Clinton’s sanctions in the process.

In 1996, while CEO of Halliburton, Cheney called sanctions against Iran “self-defeating.”4 His company was well-positioned to profi t from energy swaps. In fact, at the time Halliburton was already doing business with Iran — violating Clinton’s sanctions in the process. This was probably illegal and later prompted a criminal investigation of the corporate giant by the U.S. Justice Department.5 Cheney’s remark refl ected the cynical view: Policy be damned. Business is business. Let us enrich ourselves. As we know, after the 2000 election Cheney fl ip-fl opped, suddenly morphing into the most outspoken critic of Iran in the Bush administration. How strange that the U.S. media never held Cheney accountable, either for his sanctions busting or for his unexplained about-face. Strange indeed. In the real world, the strategic importance of Iran had been obvious since at least World War II, when Franklin Delano Roosevelt kept Stalin in the war against Hitler with a Lend-Lease line of supply through Iran, whose government was then friendly to the West. As fi ghting raged on the eastern front, some $18 billion in U.S. arms and materiel was off-loaded from ships in the Gulf and transported north by rail to the U.S.S.R..6 Entire factories were disassembled and sent to the Soviet Union in this way. Without Iran’s vital assistance it is doubtful the Soviets could have resisted the Nazi onslaught. Later, Iran was repaid for its loyalty to the West with treachery: In 1953 the CIA overthrew the popular Iranian Prime Minister Mohammad Mossadegh, who had committed the unpardonable crime of insisting on a fair price for Iran’s oil in the global marketplace. In his place, the CIA installed a tyrant, the Shah, who, though despised and feared at home, remained a compliant U.S. puppet for many years. Those who wonder, “Why do they hate us?” would do well to study this dark episode in U.S. history, which lies at the root of the present crisis.7 After 9/11, the government of Iran issued a strong condemnation of the World Trade Center attack. Soon, the U.S. and Iran discovered mutual interests in Afghanistan. Both nations were staunchly opposed to al Qaeda and the Taliban, whose retrograde form of Sunni Islam was much too extreme even for Iran’s fundamentalist mullahs. In fact, Iran was already supporting two Afghan factions opposed to the Taliban, one led by Rashid Dostum, an Uzbek warlord based in the north. The other was a Shi’ite community of three to four million Hazaras in central Afghanistan. 8Let us now briefl y review Iran’s strong opposition to the Taliban.

After 1995, as the Taliban military forces spread out from their southern Pashtun stronghold in Kandahar and extended their grip over nonPashtun areas of Afghanistan, the movement’s infl exible leaders showed no interest in broadening their base to refl ect the country’s great diversity of ethnic and religious groups. Wherever the Taliban went, they imposed draconian rule, based on a reactionary interpretation of Sunni Islam known as Wahabbism, an import from Saudi Arabia. In this respect, the Taliban was a drastic departure from the more tolerant Islamic traditions, such as mystical Sufi sm, which had fl ourished in Central Asia for centuries, but which, unfortunately, had been destroyed by the Soviet occupation and by years of civil war. The Taliban’s persecution of Shi’ites became intense. Afghani Shi’ites were given three choices: convert, leave the country, or die. A number of massacres followed, carried out by both sides, and the result was an even worse polarization of a country already in an advanced stage of disintegration. The Taliban drew most of its military, fi nancial, and political backing from just two sources, Saudi Arabia and Pakistan. The U.S. also provided aid until 2001. The opposition, later known as the Northern Alliance, received support from a long list of neighbors, including India, Iran, Russia, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan and even far-off Turkey. The Taliban also defi ed its critics by openly harboring the renegade scion of a wealthy Saudi family, one Osama bin Laden, who during the 1980s had endeared himself to the Afghan resistance because of his connections and vast fortune, which he used to spread Wahabbism. 9Even as the Taliban expanded its sphere of infl uence, Iran managed to keep opposition forces alive — just — through an intensive airlift of military and logistical support. Tehran was nearly drawn into the confl ict itself in 1998, when Tali- ban fi ghters entered the Iranian Consulate in Mazar-el-Sharif, in northern Afghanistan, and murdered eleven Iranian offi cials. The bloody incident sharply escalated tensions in the region after it was revealed that several Pakistani intelligence offi cers (from ISI, the Pakistani equivalent of the CIA) were involved in the atrocity. Both Iran and Pakistan had opposed the Soviet presence in Afghanistan, but each backed different factions of the Afghan resistance.

The Taliban massed a smaller force to repel a possible Iranian invasion. The tense standoff was only defused when UN-mediators persuaded Mullah Omar, the Taliban leader, to release a number of Iranian prisoners. It was the fi rst time the reclusive and enigmatic Omar had ever met with an international offi cial.10 This was the context for improved U.S.-Iran relations after 9/11. As U.S. forces prepared to invade Afghanistan, Iran supplied the U.S. with intelligence about the Taliban’s military assets, including targeting information, all of which proved invaluable.11 The Iranians also allowed America to use airfi elds in eastern Iran, helped with search and rescue, and even advised the U.S. on how to navigate the complex ethnic rivalries and political fault lines during the delicate negotiations with the Northern Alliance. After weeks of cooperation, the U.S.-Iran talks picked up momentum. At a December 2001 conference in Bonn, Germany, convened to set up a post-Taliban government, Iran played a helpful role by persuading the various opposition groups to moderate their demands.12 Whatever their distrust of the U.S., the mullahs of Iran had decided it was in their interest to help the Americans oust the Taliban. For a brief time it even appeared that the backdoor channel might develop into a true rapprochement. Let us now examine why this did not happen. On January 3, 2002, as U.S. occupation forces were consolidating their hold on Afghanistan, the Israelis intercepted a ship in the Red Karine A, loaded with military arms. The ship had left port in Iran and was apparently bound for the Palestinians in Gaza.13 Israel’s neocon allies in the Bush White House had opposed the dialogue with Iran from the start, and now they seized upon the incident. After a brief struggle over policy, the hard-liners prevailed — with Bush’s backing. Three weeks after the seizure of the Karine A, George W. Bush delivered his famous “axis of evil” speech, in which he lumped Iran with Iraq and North Korea as the world’s worst purveyors of state terrorism. Iran was also condemned for undermining the Mideast peace process. The reality, of course, was quite different, since in 2002 there was no existing U.S.-brokered Mideast peace process. Clinton’s Camp David initiative was long dead, and at the start of his presidency G.W. Bush had adopted a “hands off” policy regarding the Israeli-Palestinian confl ict.

In fact, this was a major departure from longstanding U.S. policy in the region. Although past U.S. Presidents Reagan, G.H.W. Bush, and Clinton were heavily biased toward Israel, they still maintained offi cial U.S. support for UN Security Council resolutions calling upon Israel to withdraw from territories seized during the 1967 Six-Day War. Past presidents had also maintained at least the pretense of serving as a regional peace broker. Bush’s abandonment of this legacy was tantamount to open support of Israel’s continuing land seizures, expanding settlements, and its harsh treatment of the Palestinians, which former President Jimmy Carter, aptly compared to Apartheid. $\\scriptstyle { \\frac { 1 4 } { 1 } } \\mathrm { F o r }$ this reason G.W. Bush’s “hands off” policy was an embarrassment to every American concerned about a just resolution of the Palestinian issue. Viewed in retrospect, it is likely that G.W. Bush’s uncritical support for Israel originated in the personage of Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon, who entered offi ce shortly after Bush (in February 2001) on a hard-line platform of “no land for peace” and no negotiations with the Palestinians. The newly elected Prime Minister Sharon had a long history of violently opposing peace talks. As a young Israel Defense Forces offi cer, Sharon had personally led unprovoked border raids against Palestinian villages in the 1950s, attacks that murdered hundreds of Palestinians and ultimately destroyed then-Israeli PM Moshe Sharett’s historic 1954 peace initiative with Egyptian President Abdul Nasser. 16 This was no doubt the intended purpose of the clandestine raids, which Sharon, true to form, staged without PM Sharett’s knowledge or consent. The peace talks with Nasser had shown signs of progress, which Sharon and other Israeli hawks viewed as anathema. Although Sharon’s unsavory involvement in what can only be called terrorism has been known to scholars for many years, the full story has never been honestly reported by the U.S. media. Had it been, Bush would likely have faced bipartisan pressure in 2001 to distance himself from Sharon, just as he did in the case of Arafat. Sharon was also the architect of Israel’s fateful 1982 invasion of Lebanon, the aim of which was to annihilate the PLO. At the time, Sharon served as Defense Minister in the government of PM Menachem Begin.

Later, he was found personally responsible by Israel’s Kahan Commission for the massacre of as many as 2,000 Palestinians at the Sabra and Shatila refugee camps, located in West Beirut.19 Although the actual killing was the bloody work of the Lebanese Phalange, a Maronite Christian faction, the militia only gained access to the camps because the Israeli army violated the U.S.-brokered cease-fi re, reoccupied Beirut, and allowed them in. Indeed, there were witnesses, including a Jewish nurse, even an American Congressman, who saw the ring of Israeli soldiers around the camps. 20The massacre brought international dishonor upon America, because the Reagan administration had guaranteed the safety of those same refugees during the negotiations which brought about the PLO’s departure from Lebanon.21 Reagan later “punished” Israel for its aggression and for putting America in the position of betraying its word by opening the spigot of U.S. aid to Israel wider than ever. In subsequent years the level of aid continued to grow, and currently stands at roughly $3 billion/year: a fl ood of cash and credit that Jewish Voice for Peace describes as “the greatest transfer of wealth from one nation to another in history.” ${ \\underline { { 2 2 } } } \\mathbf { M } \\mathbf { u c h }$ of this aid, I should mention, has been used to construct even more settlements, meaning that U.S. taxpayer dollars, far from making things better, have only added fuel to the fi re. At the time of the Karine A incident in January 2002, PM Sharon was even then preparing another military offensive against the Palestinians, which he unleashed in late March 2002. It turned out to be the largest such operation since the 1967 Six-Day War. In fact, this probably explains the controversial arms shipment. The Palestinians were surely well informed that a large Israeli military offensive was in the works, and were likely attempting to acquire arms for their own defense. Of course, the U.S. government often regards even selfdefense as “terrorism.” 23Sharon’s military offensive continued through the spring of 2002.

This included the wholesale leveling of urban areas with American supplied Caterpillar bulldozers, in addition to the usual helicopter rocket attacks, targeted assassinations, checkpoints, curfews, torture, and many other forms of harassment. Sharon had declared open season on the Palestinians, hundreds, perhaps thousands of whom were killed and many more wounded, imprisoned, or made homeless. What remained of the West Bank economy collapsed at this time. Most of the population was reduced to bare subsistence and became dependent on international food aid. For the fi rst time malnutrition became a serious problem. Many Palestinian families lived on the edge, a meal or two away from starvation. During this period, Israel also reduced to rubble most of the infrastructure (valued at hundreds of millions of dollars) built-up during the Oslo peace process. This included administrative and police buildings, radio stations, helicopter and port facilities, water utilities, electric generating plants, even schools — everything needed by a society. But this was precisely the point: to erase the efforts of the Palestinians to create their own nation. The Israelis also stole or destroyed the Palestinian Authority’s computers and everything else they could carry off: administrative documents, legal and medical records, cultural materials, census information, and the like. As the nightmare deepened, Amnesty International and other human rights organizations cited Israel for most of the violence. $\\underline { { 2 4 } } \\mathrm { Y e t }$ , true to form, U.S. government offi cials, members of Congress, and the U.S. media continued to portray the crackdown in the familiar way: Israel was merely “defending itself.” The Palestinians had brought this holocaust upon themselves because of their suicide bomber attacks and because Arafat had rejected former Israeli PM Ehud Barak’s “generous peace offer.” Yet, an honest assessment would have correctly placed at least an equal measure of blame at the doorstep of Israel and the White House,25 while also recognizing the right of the Palestinians to defend themselves against Israel’s military attacks, some of which involved advanced weapons supplied by the U.S. The heavy bias in the U.S. toward Israel was nothing new.

But it also went much further, offering Israel normalized relations, in other words, full trade and cultural ties — in short, an end to the bitter confl ict. The sole condition was that Israel abide by UN Security Council resolutions, which call on it to withdraw from the occupied territories, i.e., the West Bank and Gaza, and allow the Palestinians to develop their national homeland. The new Arab peace offer elicited no comment from PM Sharon. It was briefl y mentioned by the U.S. media, but then simply dropped out of the news, probably because the White House, taking its cue from Sharon, chose to ignore it. In fact, Bush’s silence should have prompted headlines in all of the major U.S. papers. Due to the U.S. media’s failure to cover this important story, I would bet that few Americans are aware the Arab peace offer even happened. Nonetheless, it was important, possibly even historic, because it had the backing of every Arab leader and, therefore, might have led to a comprehensive settlement of the world’s most serious longstanding confl ict. That is, if the U.S. and Israel had responded favorably.

Many will fi nd it incomprehensible, like a fable from another planet. Yet, most of the facts I have cited were recently confi rmed by two former members of G.W. Bush’s own National Security Council, Flynt Leverett and Hillary Mann, currently husband and wife, both of whom served as senior Mideast policy experts during Bush’s fi rst term.

They did not agree with Bush’s “hands off” policy, particularly his blind support for Ariel Sharon. Both understood the importance of making diplomatic progress on the Palestinian issue and the no less urgent need for pro-active diplomacy with Iran to stabilize the Gulf region and avoid a wider Mideast war. As time passed, both became increasingly alarmed by the colossal arrogance and stupidity they witnessed in Bush’s White House, and by the drift of events toward a wider Mideast confl agration, so much so that after leaving the Bush administration, the two began to speak out, even in the face of threats and attempts by the White House to muzzle them. Leverett and Mann’s story was even featured in Esquire magazine.27 The story they tell, although profoundly disturbing, is pertinent in this context because it both confi rms and fl eshes out the picture I have already sketched. Leverett tells how, in December 2001, after Syria and Iran had been cooperating with the U.S. for some weeks after 9/11, Secretary of State Colin Powell fl oated a proposal at the White House. Henceforth, the U.S. would adopt a quid pro quo approach with both nations, essentially rewarding them for their helpful intelligence, either by removing them from the offi cial terrorist list or by creating a special status for them, the point being to start an openended dialogue that could move forward, step-by-step, fostering cooperation on a broader range of issues. Powell’s proposal was astute, but went nowhere. According to Mann, the Iranians made it clear that “they were doing this because they understood the impact of this attack [i.e., 9/11] on the U.S., and they thought that if they helped us unconditionally, that would be the way to change the dynamic [between the two countries] for the fi rst time in twentyfi ve years.” 29Here, then, was a historic opportunity to reshape the troubled U.S.-Iran relationship. Yet, the Bush White House would have none of it. In the subsequent period, Leverett worked directly with crown prince Abdullah’s foreign-policy advisor, Adel Al-Jubeir, who was then in the process of drafting the 2002 Saudi peace proposal discussed above. By this time Sharon’s military offensive against the Palestinians was in full swing. In April 2002, Secretary of State Powell traveled to Israel and twice crossed the Israeli lines, walking through “no man’s land” to visit Arafat, whose compound (what remained of it) was under siege.

The purpose of his visit was to explore “political horizons.” However, a few days later, while Le- verett was meeting with senior U.S. offi cials at the David Citadel Hotel in Jerusalem, he received a call from Washington. It was Stephen Hadley, who instructed him to “tell Powell he is not authorized to to talk about a political horizon.”30 The reason? Rumsfeld and Cheney were opposed to peace talks — end of story. Leverett had to give the bad news to Powell, who was understandably furious. For the previous ten days the Secretary of State had been conferring with various world leaders about the Palestinian issue, and now the White House had pulled the rug out from under him. Leverett does not explain why Powell did not immediately resign to protest this treatment, and the insane policy. Resigning would have shown moral strength, but evidently Powell’s loyalty to Bush or perhaps his own ambition (or both) got the better of him. Weeks later, as Sharon’s military offensive continued, crown prince Abdullah fl ew to Texas to visit Bush at his ranch. The octogenarian sheikh was anything but the stereotypic playboy prince. In fact, Abdullah was one of the few in the royal family who, despite great wealth, still embodied the traditional values and simplicity of the old desert lifestyle. On his arrival in Crawford, Abdullah immediately confronted Bush with a blunt question and said he wanted an equally direct answer. “Are you going to do anything about the Palestinian issue?” the prince asked. When Bush became evasive, Abdullah stood up and said, “That’s it. The meeting is over.” Abdullah’s direct language caused a panic among Bush’s aides. As Esquire reports, “No Arab leader had ever spoken to the president like that.” ^(, 31) Yet, the crown prince could not be dismissed, either. Saudi Arabia was a key U.S. ally and absolutely vital to the world’s oil supply. Bush, Rice and Powell beat a hasty retreat into an adjoining room for a quick consultation. Minutes later, Bush returned and promised Abdullah that he would give the Palestinian issue his utmost consideration. This apparently satisfi ed the crown prince. The upbeat U.S. press coverage of the meeting between the two leaders in Texas belied the near-rupture in U.S.-Saudi relations. Powell later referred to it as “the near-death experience.” Soon after, the King of Jordan also pressed Bush to resolve the Palestinian issue, during a state visit to Washington.

No state in the Mideast, with the exception of Israel, wanted another war against Saddam Hussein. Instead, they wanted the U.S. to focus on the Palestinian issue. In response, over the next few months Leverett and others in the administration dutifully worked on a road map for peace. Leverett even promised the King of Jordan that a U.S. peace plan would be announced by year’s end. However, it never happened. Why not? For the reasons I have already indicated. Around Thanksgiving, Leverett received a call from the Jordanian foreign minister who informed him that he had just learned from Rice that the road map was off the table. The Jordanian diplomat felt betrayed and, according to Esquire, told Leverett, “Do you have any idea how this has pulled the rug out from under us, from under me? I’m the one who has to go into Arab League meetings and get beat up…. How can we ever trust you again?”32 Later, Leverett learned from Rice that PM Sharon had personally called Bush with a request to cancel the road map for peace. From the details presented in the Esquire article, it is apparent that Rice, like Powell, was simply incapable of providing the president with a policy assessment that deviated from what he wanted to hear. Once again, Sharon had scuttled a peace initiative, this time before it had even begun, and by means of a simple telephone call. This was the creature Bush described as “a man of peace.”33 The bigger question, of course, is why the President of the United States would be so easily swayed — diverted from longstanding U.S. commitments to UN Security Council resolutions on Palestine, not to mention Bush’s personal promise to crown prince Abdullah. Brent Scowcroft, a retired four-star general and former national security advisor to Presidents Ford and G.H.W. Bush, may have provided the answer when he later told the Financial Times of London that “Sharon just has Bush wrapped around his little fi nger.

I would add that two prominent American scholars, John J. Mearsheimer and Stephen M. Walt, present a more nuanced view of these events in their important book, The Israel Lobby, in which they argue that President Bush’s halting attempts to pursue a road map were effectively countered at every step by the infl uential Israel lobby. Yet, the two scholars arrive at essentially the same conclusion: In the end Bush supported policies advocated by Sharon, even though this was not in the best interests of the U.S.36 G.W. Bush’s unconditional support for Israel apparently dates back to 1998, when Bush, then governor of Texas, went on a tour of Israel organized by Matthew Brooks, head of the Republican Jewish Coalition. Later, Brooks discussed the high point of the trip, as reported by Ron Hutcheson in an August 3, 2006 McClatchy wire story: If there’s a starting point for George W. Bush’s attachment to Israel, it’s the day in late 1998 when he stood on a hilltop where Jesus delivered the Sermon on the Mount, and with eyes brimming with tears read aloud from his favorite hymn, ‘Amazing Grace.’ He [Bush] was very emotional. It was a tear-fi lled experience. He brought Israel back home with him in his heart. I think he came away profoundly moved.37 Assuming the story is accurate, and not just myth-making, it reveals G.W. Bush’s vacuous grasp of Scripture. Brooks never explained how the Sermon’s spiritual passages, such as “The meek shall inherit the earth,” “Blessed are the peacemakers,” and “Blessed are they who hunger and thirst for justice …” were somehow transmogrifi ed into support for an Israeli system of Apartheid more virulent than anything that existed in South Africa. During the same tour, Bush reportedly accompanied Ariel Sharon, then Foreign Minister, on a helicopter ride over the occupied territories, and this too made a lasting impression. Bush referred to it during the fi rst meeting of his National Security Council, held on January 30, 2001. According to then-Treasury-Secretary Paul O’Neill, who was present, Bush mentioned the ride with Sharon before declaring that it was time to end U.S. efforts to achieve peace with the Palestinians. “I just don’t see much we can do over there, at this point,” Bush said. 38Secretary of State Colin Powell objected, however, and pointed out the obvious: that the consequences of unleashing Sharon would be dire, especially for", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:The 9_11 Mystery Plane - Mark H.

Bush simply shrugged. “Maybe that’s the best way to get things back in balance,” he said. “Sometimes a show of strength by one side can really clarify things.” After 9/11, the Syrian government also shared intelligence information with the U.S., as reported by Seymour Hersh in The New Yorker.39 Syrian President Bashar Assad ordered the intelligence sharing with the CIA for the purpose of improved relations. Assad wanted off the U.S. State Department list of states that sponsor terrorism. The Syrian government had extensive fi les on Islamic extremism because of its own longrunning struggle with the Muslim Brotherhood. In the course of tracking the Brotherhood, the Syrians had penetrated many other extremist cells in the Middle East and Europe, and thus were even able to provide the CIA with dossiers on a number of the alleged 9/11 hijackers. The intelligence was current and of excellent quality.40 In another case, the Syrians supplied information about a terrorist plot to attack the U.S. Navy’s 5th Fleet headquarters in Bahrain, located in the Persian Gulf. Thanks to this information, the U.S. was able to thwart the attack and save American lives. Remarkably, the Syrians even allowed the CIA to undertake a sensitive intelligence-gathering mission inside their country — in Aleppo, near the Turkish border. The Syrians made it clear they were prepared to go even further and to provide the U.S. with detailed information about controversial Saudi links to Islamic terrorism. As Robert Baer, a former CIA fi eld offi cer, put it: “The Syrians know that the Saudis were involved in the fi nancing of the Muslim Brotherhood, and they for sure know the names.”41 When Hersh interviewed Syrian President Assad in Damascus, the Syrian leader drew a distinction between international terrorists like al Qaeda and those Assad described as the “resistance,” that is, groups such as Hezbollah, Hamas, and Islamic Jihad who are fi ghting for their land and their freedom. Even so, Assad told Hersh he was prepared to curtail the activities of such groups in Syria in return for improved relations with Washington. In the end, however, Syria received nothing for its intelligence assistance. The promising backdoor link with Damascus drew sharp fi re from Donald Rumsfeld, who accused Syria of supplying arms to the Iraqi insurgents.

Rumsfeld also claimed that Saddam had smuggled his weapons of mass destruction into Syria for safe-keeping. The charges were never substantiated and, in fact, were absurd, but Rumsfeld prevailed. Early in 2003 he demanded Syrian participation in the operational planning for the invasion of Iraq, then imminent. Although Bashar’s father, Hafez Assad, had joined the U.S.-led coalition against Saddam during the fi rst Gulf war, the son wisely declined. With the start of “Shock and Awe” in March 2003, the diplomatic opening with Syria passed into oblivion without much notice.42 According to Mann and Leverett, even after Bush’s deeply insulting “Axis of Evil” speech in 2002, the Iranians continued to show up in Geneva for backdoor talks with the U.S. The secret negotiations went on for another year, and culminated in April 2003 with a detailed Iranian proposal for a comprehensive Mideast peace. At this time Bush and the neocons were fl ying high. The U.S. military was then in the victorious mopping-up phase of the Iraq invasion. Mann was back at the State Department, and told Esquire she learned about the peace offer from the Swiss ambassador, who FAXed her a two-page summary. Switzerland was then serving as the intermediary and had conveyed the offer to the U.S. on Iran’s behalf. This was not unusual, since despite the secret channel, the U.S. and Iran still had no formal relations. The Iranian offer encompassed the full range of issues, and from the twopage summary it was clear to Mann it had come from the highest level, that is, from Iran’s Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. Mann was startled as she read one concession after another. There were offers to provide more help on the terrorism issue by ending support for Hamas and Islamic Jihad. Iran also offered to disarm Hezbollah in Lebanon and to accept much tighter oversight by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) over its nuclear program. Iran even offered to recognize Israel. The Iranians had signed-on to Abdullah’s 2002 peace offer. 43 With hindsight, Tehran’s motivation is apparent. Iran’s leaders were convinced that the U.S. planned to attack them after fi nishing with Iraq, hence their initiative to accommodate Washington and hopefully stave off a confrontation.

Yet, incredibly, the White House not only ignored the peace offer but even lodged a formal complaint with the Swiss government about their ambassador’s “meddling.” In short, it was another display of American hubris. Incidentally, in MarchApril 2006, Iran’s leaders repeated their call for negotiations with the U.S. and, once again, were rebuffed.44 But why reject a peace offer that would have accommodated the most important U.S. interests in the region, while moderating Iran’s behavior in the bargain? The answer is so straightforward, it eluded me for the longest time, just as, I suspect, it has also eluded many Americans. Negotiating with Iran’s leaders was out of the question because that would confer legitimacy upon the government of Iran — something the Bush White House has been loath to do. Why? Because since at least 2002, the Bush policy on Iran has been regime change, not peaceful coexistence. You do not negotiate with a government you are seeking to overthrow. The goal of the neocons is to install some new puppet in Tehran who will take orders from Washington. Who knows? Perhaps Reza Pahlavi, the son of the late Shah.45 But how did the policy of regime change arise? Indeed, where did it come from? It is a question that the U.S. media has never honestly explored. The fact is that the policy arose in Israel after the conclusion of the 1991 Gulf War and, some years later, was adopted by the neocons. In 1991 Operation Desert Storm greatly weakened Saddam Hussein’s military power, and for this reason the Israeli government shifted and began to view Iran as its main adversary in the region. Indeed, the dust had scarcely settled after the First Gulf War when Israel launched a campaign to prepare its own people for a future confl ict with the new nemesis. According to the late dissident scholar Israel Shahak, all of the Hebrew newspapers in Israel “… shared in the advocacy of this madness, with the exception of Ha’aretz, which has not dared to challenge it, either.”46 To my knowledge the war of words chronicled by Shahak in his important 1997 book Open Secrets has never been mentioned in the U.S. media. Israeli Prime Minister PM Yitzhak Rabin’s government then launched a parallel effort to persuade its American ally of the growing nuclear threat from Iran. As I have noted, in the 1990s U.S.-Iran relations were at low ebb. President Bill Clinton was outraged by Iran’s opposition to his Oslo Peace Process.

As I have noted, in the 1990s U.S.-Iran relations were at low ebb. President Bill Clinton was outraged by Iran’s opposition to his Oslo Peace Process. (Given the benefi t of hindsight, however, Tehran’s reasons at the time now appear astute and almost prophetic.) As mentioned, in 1995 Clinton hardened his policy of containing Iran with an executive order imposing a package of sweeping economic sanctions. Clinton even punished a dozen Russian companies for their nuclear and military trade with Iran, especially transfers of missile technology. The concern was not only with Iran’s resurgent nuclear program, but also with its continuing development of a delivery vehicle, namely, the Shahab-3 missile. Experts worried that the missile would eventually be capable of targeting U.S. bases in the Gulf, as well as Israel.47 As I have noted, Clinton had little success persuading the European allies to support his sanctions policy. Clinton’s reluctance to confront Israel over its expanding settlement policies in the West Bank surely had much to do with this, not to mention the U.S. double standard about Israel’s nuclear weapons program. The world looked to Washington for leadership, but instead saw hypocrisy. Throughout the 1990s the policy of the European Union toward Iran was one of “critical engagement.”48 The call was repeated in April 2003, just weeks after the U.S. invasion of Iraq, this time by Daniel Ayalon, the Israeli ambassador to Washington. In a press statement, Ayalon called for regime change in Syria and Iran, to be achieved by “diplomatic isolation, economic sanctions, and psychological pressure. Ω^( • • 0) The ambassador stopped just short of advocating a U.S.-led war against the two countries. Ayalon noted that while the overthrow of Saddam Hussein had created new opportunities for Israel, it was “not enough.” “We have to follow through,” Ayalon told a sympathetic conference of the Anti-Defamation League. “We still have great threats of that magnitude coming from Syria, coming from Iran.” Ayalon also criticized the European Union for its commerce with Iran and even advocated a suspension of diplomatic ties. “Governments should not allow visits by Iranian leaders such as President Sayed Mohammed Khatami and Foreign Minister Kamal Kharrazi,” said the ambassador. “And foreign leaders should not visit Iran. I don’t think this is the way to deal with them, because the more the regime is isolated, the shorter its days …” Yet, the Iranian leaders named by Ayalon were anything but radicals. In fact, Khatami and Kharrazi were both moderates who favored improved ties with the West, especially the U.S. Ayalon went on to express a delusional hubris", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:The 9_11 Mystery Plane - Mark H.

In fact, Khatami and Kharrazi were both moderates who favored improved ties with the West, especially the U.S. Ayalon went on to express a delusional hubris rivaling that of Cheney and Rumsfeld in the case of Iraq: “… and, as I mentioned, there is fertile ground in Iran to have a regime change there. Seventy percent of the population [of Iran] are really ready for regime change. They have tasted, they have been experiencing, before, democracy and Western cultures and they are yearning for it.” In recent years, the neocons have echoed the increasingly strident statements of Israeli offi cials about Iran. In 2005 Vice President Cheney hinted that “the Israelis might well decide to act fi rst, and let the rest of the world worry about cleaning up the diplomatic mess afterwards.”51 In October of 2007, Bush himself warned that Iran’s nuclear program could trigger World War III. 52Hard-liners like Joe Lieberman openly support a “preventive” attack on Iran’s nuclear sites and even liberals, like Hillary Clinton have adopted a hard line. Of late, the news has been fi lled with scary reports that Israel, or the U.S., or both jointly, intend to stage an attack in the near future. One report even claimed that the Israeli Air Force was rehearsing the use of nuclear bunker busters. 53 Unfortunately, the reports can not be dismissed, because of Israel and The charges against Iran are especially dubious in light of Washing- ton’s own hypocrisy on the nuclear issue. There is no question that Iran, which is a signatory to the Nonproliferation Treaty, has the right to develop nuclear power for peaceful use. One may disagree with Tehran’s decision to do so — I do, because I oppose the nuclear path in general — but clearly Iran is within its rights under Article IV of the treaty. The U.S. had no problem supplying nuclear technology to the dictatorial Shah of Iran in the 1970s. In fact, several of the neocons, including Donald Rumsfeld, were personally involved in arranging transfers of U.S. technology at that time. Bush’s ongoing nuclear trade with India and his massive support for nuclear-armed Pakistan, both of which developed the Bomb while refusing to sign the NPT, point to the real problem: Washington’s selective and even arbitrary interpretation of its own treaty. And then, of course, there is the 800-pound gorilla, namely, Israel, whose undeclared nuclear arsenal makes a mockery of U.S. attempts to portray Iran as a rogue state.

It could even be argued that Washington’s refusal to openly acknowledge Israel’s nuclear status is a strong indicator that the nuclear nonproliferation regime is kaput — has already disintegrated. Stupid and infl ammatory statements by Iranian President Ahmedinejad have been seized upon and portrayed as a casus belli, and while I agree that his remarks have been unhelpful, it appears they were intentionally mistranslated. Nor, in any event, does Ahmadinejad control Iran’s nuclear program. That power rests in the cautious hands of the Supreme Mullah. The whole issue is a red herring: an attempt to cast the policy of regime change in defensive terms and make it more palatable. The bottom line is simply that Israel, with U.S. backing, seeks to maintain its nuclear hegemony in the region. For many years the shared wisdom was that nuclear weapons might be justifi ed in Israel’s case, due to the country’s unique security problems, having to do with Israel’s small size. Nukes might be acceptable, so the thinking went, because Israel would then feel secure enough to negotiate a lasting peace settlement with its neighbors. But it hasn’t worked out that way. As it happened, a strong Israel simply had no incentive to negotiate. Period. In a thoughtful article that appeared in Ha’aretz in September 2005, Baruch Kimmerling, a professor at Hebrew University, conceded what scholars have long known: that the country’s nuclear weapons are linked to Israel’s illegal military occupation of the Arab West Bank. As Kimmerling phrased it, Israel’s nukes “in the basement are a guarantee that no pressure, foreign or domestic … can force Israel into genuine territorial concessions.” ¹⁹⁵⁵ Clearly, Kimmerling’s assessment is correct: For many years the country’s nuclear monopoly has tempted Israel’s nation’s leaders to forego negotiations and simply to impose their will upon the neighborhood. This explains the expanding settlements, the invasion of Lebanon in 1982, the security wall, the cantonization of the West Bank, and the recent unilateral withdrawal from Gaza. And why else would Israel dismiss a 2002 Saudi peace initiative that offered not just recognition but full normalized relations, including full trade, economic ties, cultural exchanges, in short, an end to the confl ict, if Israel would abide by UN Security Council resolutions on Palestine?

Others pooh-pooh the matter, but in my opinion this is the crux of it. We need a rude awakening, and let us pray it does not come in the form of a mushroom cloud. The truth is that Israel’s nukes are weapons of mass destruction, pure and simple, whose very existence is a moral obscenity, just like all such weapons: an affront to God and every living thing on this planet. We need to start thinking about them in these terms. Of course, Israel’s supporters invariably downplay the dangers. They rationalize the shocking fact that Israel has targeted a large swath of humanity with annihilation by arguing that Israel’s WMDs are not a concern, since Israel has neither used its nukes nor threatened to use them; anyway the arsenal is necessary for Israel’s survival in a tough neighborhood. But no matter how often these phony arguments are repeated, the facts cannot be made to support them. If Israel possessed only a few atomic weapons of last resort, the Samson option (as Seymour Hersh refers to it) might be reasonable. However, the vast size of Israel’s weapons arsenal, the strong likelihood it includes hydrogen bombs, tactical nukes including neutron weapons, and a multiple array of advanced delivery vehicles, including nuclear armed cruise missiles, not to mention chemical and biological weapons, indicates that Israel’s policy is not primarily defensive in nature. The large size of Israel’s arsenal is probably due, in part, to the technological impera tive. Israel’s war economy developed a momentum of its own. But this is a fl imsy excuse and no justifi cation. Israel’s WMDs are clearly meant to project power and to this extent they have already been used. One need not pull the trigger of a revolver to use it, and the same is true of the bomb. The people of the Mideast understand this very well. After all, they have lived in the long shadow of Israel’s arsenal of 200400 nukes for many years.56 In his 2007 memoir, former Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Green span acknowledges that despite all the talk about WMD, oil was the pri mary reason for the 2003 U.S. invasion of Iraq. “I am saddened,” Green span writes in his book, “that it is politically inconvenient to acknowledge what everyone knows: the Iraq war is largely about oil.”57 Certainly the Iraqi people did not need to be reminded by Greenspan.

They knew the truth from the fi rst days of the U.S. occupation of Baghdad, when the U.S. military broadcast America’s real intentions by assigning troops to protect the oil ministry, while allowing Iraq’s thirteen national museums — the nation’s crown jewels — to be ransacked. Later, the U.S. military claimed it did not have suffi cient resources to protect the museums, but this is nonsense. A few tanks would have suffi ced. The full extent of the losses may never be known, since in many cases the inventories of the holdings are also missing. But it is safe to say that the destruction to Iraq’s 6,000year historical legacy was incalculable. This, of course, in addition to the tens of thousands of dead and wounded Iraqis and the vast damage to the nation’s infrastructure wreaked by “Shock and Awe.” Several days after the museums were looted, Iraq’s National Library & Archives was also burned, along with the Library of Korans at the Ministry of Religious Affairs. An Iraqi citizen would have had to be brain dead — on lifesupport — to miss the symbolism. Imag ine our reaction if foreigners invaded the U.S. for the purpose of liberating America, then presided over the looting of the Smithsonian and the de struction of the U.S. Archives and Library of Congress. Paul Zimansky, an archaeologist at Boston University, called it “the greatest cultural disaster of the last 500 years.” Eleanor Robson, a fellow of All Souls College, Ox ford, agreed. Said Robson, “You’d have to go back centuries to the Mongol invasion of Baghdad in 1258 to fi nd looting on this scale.”58 Let us remember, we are not just talking about Iraq’s cultural heritage.

In May 2003, the Bush White House underscored the criminal na ture of the U.S. invasion by decreeing that, henceforth, U.S. oil companies would be immune from any legal challenges under Iraqi law. In other words, they were free to despoil the environment and swindle the Iraqi people of their liquid gold without fear of ever being held accountable. ⁶⁰ In 2007 , the Iraqi government announced, probably at the instigation of Washington, that it would refuse to honor a preexisting drilling contract with Lukoil, a Russian oil company. 61 Cancelation of the contract, which predated the U.S. invasion and had been negoti ated by Saddam himself, cleared the way for the oil ministry to open up the rich West Qurna oil fi eld to new bids by U.S. and other “approved” oil companies. All of this surely confi rmed, to anyone paying attention, that the neo con plan from the beginning was to divvy up the spoils of war among the “coalition of the willing.” I should mention, however, that there is no evidence the U.S. oil industry helped formulate the new policy. In fact, it appears that the oil companies were wary of Bush’s war plan, despite the enticements.62 Oil companies are motivated by profi t, but they are not stupid. To prosper they need political stability, which probably explains why the major U.S. oil companies have long supported a Mideast peace settlement. Their support dates from the presidency of Richard Nixon, when Sec retary of State William Rogers fi rst advocated such a plan.63 Unfortunately, Rogers was outmaneuvered by Henry Kissinger, Nixon’s top adviser, whose primary goal was shielding Israel. This became the U.S. policy, and it has not changed over the years except to become ever more entrenched. Without question, the increasing hostility toward America that has re sulted from U.S. support for Israeli Apartheid and for dictatorial Arab governments has made life much more diffi cult for U.S. oil companies trying to do business in the region. The Iraqi people had good reason to doubt the sincerity of U.S. rhetoric about planting the seeds of western democracy — propaganda that in any event was aimed more at Americans than Iraqis.

Leading Democrats like Hillary Clinton, for example, have harped on this issue. What Clinton and the rest fail to un derstand is that the necons never planned for Iraq’s recovery, because their plan from the outset was to dismember the country. The war was “largely about oil,” yes, but this was by no means the full story. The neocons’ grand design, ambitious in scope, called for redrawing the regional map to benefi t Israel and the U.S. The plan was to partition Iraq into pieces, and one of the keys to its success was persuading Jordan’s Hashemite rulers to go along. Surely this is why Vice President Cheney pitched the U.S. war plan to Jordanian crown prince Hassan at a London meeting in July 2002.64 ProU.S. dissident Iraqis were also present. The grand design was no secret and was even discussed in the Israeli press. ${ \\underline { { 6 5 } } } \\mathrm { O f }$ course, it was never mentioned in the U.S. media. Here the plan to redraw the map was considered a hardsell. This is why Americans were kept in the dark — fed lies about weapons of mass destruction and “spreading democracy.” The Hashemite family had once ruled Iraq as well as Jordan. Indeed, Jordan’s present King Abdullah is the second cousin of the last Iraqi mon arch, Feisel II, who as a young prince fought alongside (and was greatly esteemed by) T.E. Lawrence during the fi erce desert campaign that de feated the Ottoman Turks in World War I. The campaign is recounted in Lawrence’s war memoir, Seven Pillars of Wisdom, and was made famous in the Hollywood fi lm Lawrence of Arabia. Feisal ruled the kingdom of Iraq until the 1958 revolution, which eventually brought Saddam Hussein to power. The point is that the Hashemites had never relinquished their claim to the throne, and it seems this became the neocon hook. In return for Jordan’s support, the neocons offered to restore Hashemite rule. Hassan would be installed as the new king of Iraq, or Jordan would simply be allowed to annex most of the country, including Baghdad, which would cease to be a capital city. The Kurdish region in the north would remain autonomous, but would nominally also be a part of the new Hashemite realm.

Or: more likely, it would be folded into Kuwait. Jordan was the key to making all of this happen. But, of course, there was a price. In return for much expanded Hashemite infl uence in the region, Jordan, at some point, would be required to accept a new infl ux of Palestinian refugees who would be “encouraged” to emigrate from the West Bank by the Israeli army. (This in addition to the large Palestinian refugee population already living in Jordan.) The forced transfer would allow Ariel Sharon to complete the Jewish settlement of territories seized in the 1967 war — unopposed. In essence, Jordan would become the Pal estinian homeland. Hashemite concerns about political instability caused by so many refugees would be mitigated by Jordan’s expansion to include millions of additional Iraqis. The Palestinians would remain a minority population. Jordan would also agree to allow the construction of a new pipeline across its expanded territory, from Kirkuk to Haifa, Israel. This would al low oil from Kurdistan to reach the world market, and would also permanently solve Israel’s energy problems. 66Haifa would become, in the words of Israeli Infrastructure Minister Yusef Paritzky, “the Rotterdam of the Middle East.”67 The Kurds would be encouraged to fl ood the world mar ket with oil, driving down the price to $15 /barrel or under. This would undermine OPEC (the Organization of In his memoirs, former CIA Director George Tenet admits that “the decisions we made tended to fracture Iraq, not to bring it together.” 69The key decisions he refers to include the May 2003 disbanding of the Iraqi army and the purging of the Baath party, both of which had many untoward effects. 40,000 Iraqi school teachers, for example, were thrown out of work simply because of their Baath party membership. Viewed in retrospect, these decisions appear to have been perversely designed to render the country prostrate. Was this the goal, all along: to insure that Iraq would never again challenge Israel? We know the names of the policy-makers. When Tenet says, “we,” he means Donald Rumsfeld, Paul Wolfowitz, Douglas Feith and, no doubt, Dick Cheney.

Nor have I seen any evidence that the Jordanians signed on to the U.S. war plan. In short, it was another case of American hubris — but on a colossal scale. In March 2007, while delivering a speech on on the fourth anniversary of the U.S. invasion, the late Lt. General William Odom, former director of the National Security Agency called the neocons’ blunder “the greatest strategic disaster in U.S. history.” Odom then added, “And the longer America stays [in Iraq] the worse it will be. It’s time to ‘cut and run.’”71 Unfortunately, we now face an even worse disaster. What happened in Iraq may be repeated in the case of Iran, only magnifi ed several times over. The sovereign nation of Iran, the world’s fourth largest oil producer, has three times the population of Iraq and fi ve times the size. Clearly, an attack on the country would be madness. This is true for many reasons, not the least of which is the vulnerability of our naval forces to cruise missile attack. In March 2007, after years of evading the issue, the U.S. Navy fi nally confi rmed research that I had posted about this issue on the Internet as early as 2004.72 Pentagon offi cials acknowledged that despite six years of warnings from weapons testers, the U.S. Navy still had no effective defense against the latest Russian anti-ship missile, known in the West as the Sizzler. 73Moscow manufactures advanced cruise missiles largely for export and aggressively markets them on the world market. The weapons are a cash-cow for Russia, and though the details are not known, Iran may well have acquired them in signifi cant numbers. If so, this means that a U.S. attack on Iran would almost certainly provoke a counter-attack upon the U.S. Fifth Fleet on patrol in the Persian Gulf. In a story carried by Bloomberg.com, Orville Hanson, who has evaluated weapons for the U.S. Navy for 38 years, described the Sizzler as a “carrier destroying” weapon. The missile is a sea skimmer. It fl ies about thirty feet above the ocean, initially at subsonic speeds. However, about ten nautical miles from its target, a rocket-propelled warhead separates and accelerates to three times the speed of sound. As the missile makes its fi nal approach, it performs very high-speed defensive maneuvers, including sharp-angled dodges, which make it extremely diffi cult to track and intercept. Thomas Christie, the Navy’s top weapons testing offi cial, acknowledged to Bloomberg that, since 2001, he had received assurances that the Navy planned “to fully fund", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:The 9_11 Mystery Plane - Mark H.

Thomas Christie, the Navy’s top weapons testing offi cial, acknowledged to Bloomberg that, since 2001, he had received assurances that the Navy planned “to fully fund the development and production’’ of missiles that could replicate the Sizzler in order to learn how to defend against it. But, said Christie, “They haven’t.” By March 2007, the Pentagon considered the threat so serious, according to an offi cial budget document, that Deputy Secretary of Defense Gordon England gave the Navy just weeks to explain how it planned to counter the Russian-made missile. Charles McQueary, director of the Pentagon’s weaponstesting offi ce, warned that if no answer was forthcoming, he would block ship and weapons productions programs until the matter was addressed. $\\boldsymbol { \\underline { { 7 4 } } } \\mathbf { M } \\mathbf { c } \\mathbf { Q }$ ueary threatened to halt nearly $80 billion in new contracts, including Northrop-Grumman’s planned start-up of a new $35.8 billion CVN-21 aircraftcarrier. Other defense contractors that would be affected included General Dynamics and Raytheon. This sober news should have prompted front-page headlines in the New York Times and Washington Post. But insofar as I know, apart from the lone report by Bloomberg.com, the U.S. media was strangely silent on the issue. Once again, the U.S. press failed to do its job. A war with Iran would likely spin out of control and put the U.S. on a collision course with Russia and China, both of which are heavily invested in the country. China’s surging economy depends on Iranian gas and oil. Moreover, China has become Washington’s chief creditor — the result of Bush’s unbridled defi cit spending and the offshoring of U.S. industry. For its part, Russia still has a potent nuclear force, and one that is aimed at the United States. Madness, indeed. The truth is that Iran ought to be a U.S. friend and ally — not our foe. As I write, the latest National Intelligence Estimate (NIE) was released on December 3, 2007, representing the collective judgement of all sixteen U.S. intelligence agencies.75 It concluded that Iran abandoned all work on nuclear weapons in 2003, which — notice — coincides with the date of the Iranian peace offer already discussed. This strongly suggests that the Iranian offer was serious, not just posturing. Obviously, the timely release of the NIE dealt the neocons a temporary setback.

In one fell swoop the U.S. intelligence community repudiated the Bush administration’s main argument for bombing Iran’s nuclear sites. This may indicate that the U.S. power elite is deeply divided about Bush and is having second thoughts about U.S. military involvement in the Persian Gulf. At the very least, there appears to be growing dissatisfaction with Bush’s style of U.S. imperialism. While this is good news and has slowed the drift toward a wider war, we should remember that the entire region, from Lebanon to Pakistan, remains a powder keg. The tense standoff is certain to continue as long as the White House belligerently spurns Tehran’s peace overtures while maintaining U.S. occupation forces in Iraq and Afghanistan — on Iran’s borders. The construction of numerous U.S. military bases inside Iraq, and a gigantic new U.S. embassy in Baghdad, which has been described as a selfcontained fortress, surely indicates that the neocons have no plans for US withdrawal from the region. Does the U.S. leadership actually believe it can gain control over Iran’s immense oil reserves? Will the U.S. go to war at the behest of Israel — again? 9 Bin Laden enjoyed considerable infl uence in Saudi Arabia after the defeat of the So- viets in Afghanistan, due to his involvement with the Afghani resistance. However, a rupture with the royal family occurred after Saddam’s 1990 invasion of Kuwait, when the Saudi king declined bin Laden’s offer to employ Islamic fi ghters to repel the Iraqi army. Instead, the Saudi leader admitted U.S. military forces, which enraged bin Laden because the presence of foreign troops in the country was viewed as a defi lement of the holy sites. Although bin Laden was placed under house arrest for a time, later he reportedly struck a deal with the Saudi government which allowed him to leave the country with most of his fortune, and to maintain contacts so long as he promised not to attack the royal family. For several years Bin Laden operated out of a base in Kartoum, Sudan, before moving to Afghanistan in June 1996. The amicable deal with the Saudi government would explain why bin Laden admitted Saudi intelligence chief Prince Turki to his hospital room in Dubai, just weeks before the 9/11 attack.

True sovereignty lies not in popular opinion, but in the creative powers of the individual human mind. And as I stated during my press conference on the Bilderberg group at the European Parliament in Brussels on June 1, 2010, “Until we can bring mankind into the Age of Reason, our understanding of reality will be shaped in actuality, not by the wills of masses of humanity, but by the mere handfuls who, for purposes of good or evil, steer the fate of mankind generally as herds of cows are steered to and from the pasture—and, occasionally, also to the slaughter-house.” p until four years ago, nobody had ever heard of WikiLeaks, but the fact is, it is becoming massively important. There are currently over 74,000,000 references to WikiLeaks on Google. It has been said that in just three years, WikiLeaks has published more scoops than the Washington Post has in thirty. The operating manual from the Guantanamo prison camp was leaked by the group, and most recently, a CIA report on how to manipulate public opinion in France and Germany with the goal of keeping their troops in Afghanistan. During his live television show, Brian Lehrer asked Salon’s columnist Glen Greenwald and Cryptome’s John Young: “So, what does it mean when anyone can post secret information on line? Is it a wonderful new era of openness and citizen journalism or is it an irresponsible age in which governments, corporations and individuals become embarrassed, ineffective and even in danger.”1 No matter how one decides to look at it, WikiLeaks represents a change to the status quo, an international and non-corporate interference into the business of information; a brown paper envelope of the digital age, striking fear into the heart of everyone with something to hide.

Jeffrey Steinberg, writing for the EIR reports that, “The goal of the group was unabashed: to interfere into the internal affairs of Russia under the doublespeak slogan that the ‘Russo-Chechen war’ must be settled ‘peacefully.’”8 Steinberg made it quite clear when he stated in his September 17, 2004 Executive Intelligence Review article, “A review of the group’s leading members reveals that this is anything but a bunch of peaceniks. The founding chairs of the group [ACPC] were Brzezinski, former Reagan Secretary of State Alexander “I’m in Charge Here” Haig, and former Congressman Stephen Solarz (D-N.Y.).

What does an organization involved with Afghanistan have to do with Egypt? Nothing, except that it forms a part of the interlocked apparatus of financial and political interests linked to Freedom House. With the ostensible aim of helping the political opposition in Egypt, these agencies have provided massive “overt and covert funding for black operations by various U.S. governmental agencies”17 not only in Egypt, but also in Russia, Africa, South America and the Middle East. For example, Afghan Aid, was the primary organization to massively support Afghan ‘mujahideen’ (holy warriors), as they came to be known at the time of Soviet invasion.

The ARC “was established in 1980 by Wall Street investment banker and spy John The “stated purpose of the ARC was to raise ‘seed money’ for medical organizations treating casualties among the mujahideen.”20 However, its real operation was far more sinister. One of ARC’s favorites was Gulbuddin Hekmatyar and his Hezb-i-Islami group as well as the Haqqani clan and the money raised was more often than not channelled into the warlords’ pockets. Gulbuddin Hekmatyar, one of the most sadistic warlords and drug traffickers, was on the CIA payroll and received more than $30 million during the war against the Red Army in the 1980s. Others who enjoyed the favors of the Agency were the Haqqani clan. Between 1980 and 1986, the CIA had given the Haqqanis $28 million, plus Stinger missiles and 4 tanks. The Haqqani immediately sold the tanks to the Soviets and when the war ended, the CIA bought back the Stingers for 10 times their value, paying nearly $400, 000 for each. The Haqqanis, being honest and ethical, invested the money in al-Qaeda, making friends in the process with Osama bin Laden, several sheiks from Saudi Arabia and senior Pakistani intelligence. Is this a case of the tail wagging the dog or a snake eating its own tail? Whichever it is, the interlocked nature of these organizations certainly gives one enough food for thought. “From its inception, the ARC worked closely with Freedom House, which had been chaired by Leo Cherne since the 1940s, and whose treasurer, Walter Schloss, was a long-time business associate of Train. Cherne was the vice-director of “The main known financial beneficiaries of ARC were Doctors Without Borders,”22 founded by Bilderberg’s own Bernard Couchner. “This organization, whose most prominent representative was Danielle Mitterrand, wife of President François Mitterrand of France, also received money from the National Endowment for Democracy.”23 In a bitter irony and delicious example of political double-talk, the organizations supporting dictators, murderers, warlords and corrupt political agendas are the same groups WikiLeaks has been targeting for financial support. Why would that be, if we believe their anti-establishment propaganda? But are they really anti-establishment, and if not who do they work for and what long-sighted agenda do they represent? In this book, we will try to answer all of these questions.

In this book, we will try to answer all of these questions. What remains WikiLeaks’ best kept secret is the source to Assange, “the linchpin of WikiLeaks’ financial network is Germany’s Wau Holland Foundation.… Mr. Assange said WikiLeaks gets about half its money from modest donations processed by its website, and the other half from ‘personal contacts,’ including ‘people with some millions who approach us….’”24 Back in early 2007, when very few people could have imagined that the WikiLeaks circus was coming to town, complete with albino jugglers, three-legged acrobats, belly dancers and a poetry-reciting cyclops, WikiLeaks acknowledged “that the project had been ‘founded by Chinese dissidents, mathematicians and startup company technologists, from the US, Taiwan, Europe, Australia and South Africa…. [Its advisory board] includes representatives from expat Russian and Tibetan refugee communities, reporters, a former US intelligence analyst and cryptographers.’”26 One of the key players on the Board is Philip Adams, who “held key posts in Australian governmental media administration”27 and contributed to the Times, the Financial Times in London and the New York Times. [Adams worked as a] columnist for the Australian since the 1960s. The Australian is owned by News Corporation, a property of Rupert Murdoch, member of the Council on Foreign Relations (CFR) and the Bilderberg Group. You could hardly call him anti-establishment. He is the representative of the International Committee of Index on Censorship28 would it [surprise you to know] that WikiLeaks was awarded the 2008 Index on Censorship Freedom of Expression award.29 How is that for a coincidence? Another individual associated with WikiLeaks is Ben Laurie, a former security boss of Google, who denied knowledge of his involvement and further stated that “his only substantive interaction with the group was when Assange approached him to help design a system that would protect leakers’ anonymity.”30 Google has been associated with a proprietary investment company run by the CIA, In-Q-Tel, a public face of the National Security Agency, America’s most powerful intelligence organization. On February 4, 2010, the Washington Post announced that “The world’s largest Internet search company and the world’s most powerful electronic surveillance organization are teaming up in the name of cybersecurity.”31 Cyber Security is a large hidden part of the WikiLeaks project, something they would rather you not know anything about. So, one of the people on the board of WikiLeaks comes from this environment. “Time magazine has characterized financier George Soros as a ‘modern-day Robin Hood,’ who robs from the rich to give to the poor countries of eastern Europe and Russia.

It claimed that Soros makes huge financial gains by speculating against western central banks, in order to use his profits to help the emerging post-communist economies of eastern Europe and former Soviet Union, to assist them to create what he calls an ‘Open Society.’ The Time statement is entirely accurate in the first part, and entirely inaccurate in the second. He robs from rich western countries, and uses his profits to rob even more savagely from the East, under the cloak of ‘philanthropy.’ His goal is to loot wherever and however he can.”34 What does not pass a smell test is the plethora of Chinese and Tibetan dissidents on WikiLeaks’ Advisory Board. For example, one of the Board members is Tashi Namgyal Khamsitsang, a “Tibetan exile & activist”35 is a former President of the Washington Tibet Association, and a member of the Tibetan Government-in-Exile. In July 2010, he was appointed by the Governor of Washington State to the State Commission on Asian Pacific American Affairs. Another, “Wang Youcai, co-founded the Chinese Democracy Party and a leader of the Tiananmen Square protests. Imprisoned for conspiring to overthrow the Government of China… he was exiled in 2004 under international political pressure, especially from the United States. He is also a ‘member of Chinese Constitutional Democratic Transition Research and a member of the Coordinative Service Platform of the China Democracy Party’”36 1989 are shrouded in the images of CNN and the lonely protester with a shopping bag, dressed in a white shirt and black trousers, blocking a column of tanks. But as F. William Engdahl writes, “What few know is that Tiananmen Square in June 1989 was an early attempt of the US intelligence to interfere in the internal affairs of the Peoples’ Republic of China and to implement what later came to be called Color Revolutions. Similar Color Revolutions were later run by Washington in Serbia against Milosevic, in Ukraine with the so-called Orange Revolution, Georgia’s Rose Revolution and other geopolitical destabilizations aimed at creating Washington-friendly regime changes.”37 Strangely enough, or perhaps not, the advisory board members list no longer appears on WikiLeaks’ website. “In the currently available description, the reference to the Chinese dissidents and the origins of the other members has been removed. WikiLeaks rather puts the emphasis on not being a covert operation”38 If they are not a covert, intelligence-run operation, then why the cover-up and the secrecy?

Scott Creighton writes in globalresearch.ca December 11, 2010 edition: “You tack PR guys with News cork affiliations onto Chinese dissidents who have been probably funded by the CIA in times past… mesh that up with John Young’s 2006 conclusions, and you come away with a different view of WikiLeaks altogether… especially when you look at the sum total of the work they have “leaked” over the years.”39 Another key Chinese dissident involved in the WikiLeaks project is Xiao Qiang, “‘founder and publisher of China Digital Times,’ which is a grantee of the National Endowment for Democracy (NED).”40 [He is also a commentator for] Radio Free Asia, “funded by the Broadcasting Board of Governors (BBG)^(′′41) which “encompasses all U.S. civilian international broadcasting, including the Voice of America (VOA), Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty (RFE/RL), Radio Free Asia (RFA).”42 The U.S. Congress, through the Central Intelligence Agency, provided initial funding for RFE and RL. The Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation is interlocked with Ford Foundation, Rockefeller Foundation and Andrew W. Mellon Foundation. These groups are the figureheads for a 37-year-old propaganda machine run through the Worldwatch Institute, which is bought and paid for by the environmentalist cartel interests whose objective is to reduce the world’s population to a more manageable 2 billion people through aggressive de-population schemes. “Other Worldwatch funding agencies include the U.N. Environment Program, the U.N. Population Fund, the Rockefeller Brothers Fund,, the Winthrop Rockefeller Trust, the Lynn R. and Karl E. Pickett Fund, the Robert R. McCormick Charitable Trust, and the Pew Charitable Trusts”44 Plus they receive funding from the Earth Institute and the Aspen Institute. The Earth Institute was created in 1995 in New York City … to serve as a co-ordinating centre to push propaganda for global warming and offering the Malthusian doctrine of ‘sustainable development’ as an alleged solution.… The sustainable development mantra is that mankind, through industrialization … is consuming ‘finite resources’ at an unsustainable rate. [Thus, the idea to de-industrialize the world in order to save the planet from itself.] The Earth’s Institute director, Jeffrey Sachs, is notorious for enforcing ‘shock therapy’ on Russia, Poland, and several other Eastern European nations during the 1990s, after the fall of communism, which thereby produced precipitous drops in industrial production and mass unemployment.…45 Jeffrey Sachs and company are well known to the readers of my book Shadow Masters.

Sachs unleashed market reforms on Russia’s proto-democracy, creating the collapse of the Russian economy. “This colonization, masked as reforms, destroyed the basic institutions of Russian society, the financial system of the state, its scientific and technological potential and transferred the rights to exploit the most valuable raw materials deposits to transnational corporations while establishing control over the Russian stock exchange.”46 Who is behind the Earth Institute? Well, your usual characters. “The Rockefeller Brothers Fund has poured a large stream of money into the Earth Institute. The Institute counts among its Advisory Board members” Kenneth Arrow, a pioneer in “systems analysis”; and … financier George Soros.47 WikiLeaks has approached The Rockefeller Brothers fund for financial donations, but it is unknown whether anything came of it. “The Rockefeller Foundation was created in 1913 by John D. Rockefeller out of the family’s Standard Oil (today Exxon-Mobil and Chevron) fortune.… In the 1920s and the 1930s, the Rockefeller Foundation funded Germany’s Kaiser Wilhelm Institute of Anthropology, Human Heredity and Eugenics, where Fritz Lenz and Eugen Fischer pioneered Nazi work on eugenics and ‘racial hygiene.’ …The Standard Oil combine, along with the Rockefeller-owned Chase Manhattan Bank, were prime collaborators of Hitler and his Vichy puppet government in France. Together, the Rockefeller Foundation and the Rockefeller Brothers Fund have shovelled tens of millions of dollars into environmentalist projects operated by World Wildlife Fund and Greenpeace….”48 But, it gets better! Then, there is the Aspen Institute. “Aspen was founded by Robert Maynard Hutchins, the long-time chancellor of the University of Chicago, who was the leading American ally of the late Lord Bertrand Russell, the international socialist who advocated the elimination of science and the systematic elimination of the darker-skinned races.… To this day, Aspen is one of the leading Malthusian policy snake-pits in the world, peddling the idea of food as a weapon.”49 Why are all these environmentalist, anti-progress and leading Malthusian organizations congregating around WikiLeaks? As Julie Lévesque writes, “Among the Chinese dissidents once listed on the board is Wang Dan. He was a leader of the Tiananmen Square democracy movement,” which “earned him the top spot on China’s list of ‘21 Most Wanted Beijing Student Leaders.’” He was imprisoned for his subversive activities and “exiled in 1998 under international political pressure to the United States.”50 He is chairman of the Chinese Constitutional Reform Association, and sits on the editorial board of Beijing Spring, a magazine funded by NED, the “chief democracy-promoting foundation” according to an article by Judith Miller in the", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:WL0003SearchInside_cleaned.txt:7:03b7a717441e", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 6512, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "WL0003SearchInside_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/Deconstructing-Wikileaks-Daniel-Estulin/dp/1937584119", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "WL0003SearchInside_cleaned", "chunk_index": 8, "text": "was a leader of the Tiananmen Square democracy movement,” which “earned him the top spot on China’s list of ‘21 Most Wanted Beijing Student Leaders.’” He was imprisoned for his subversive activities and “exiled in 1998 under international political pressure to the United States.”50 He is chairman of the Chinese Constitutional Reform Association, and sits on the editorial board of Beijing Spring, a magazine funded by NED, the “chief democracy-promoting foundation” according to an article by Judith Miller in the New York Times. One of the founders of NED was quoted as saying “A lot of what we [NED] do today was done covertly 25 years ago by the CIA.” (quoted in William Blum, Rogue State: A Guide to the World’s Only Superpower, 2000, p. 180).51 So, the CIA $\\underline { { \\underline { { \\mathbf { \\Pi } } } } }$ NED = Chinese Dissidents = Catherine T.

The question I have, again, is what are all these Tiananmen dissidents with links to CIA funding doing on the board of an alleged anti-establishment organization such as WikiLeaks? “The award of the Nobel Peace Prize to Liu Xiaobo was clearly no coincidence of events. Rather it must be understood in my view as a calculated part of a long-term strategy, not from a few members of the Norwegian Parliament, but from the leading elite circles of the world’s hegemonic power, the United States, to break China’s stride to become a sovereign and leading world economic factor. …[This] is all part of an orchestrated deeper game, using ‘human rights,’ and a web of NGOs and organizations that Washington controls directly or indirectly, as a weapon of Washington geopolitics.”52 the Independent Chinese PEN Center until 2007 and currently holds a seat on its board according to his official biography at the PEN International website. PEN is not just any random collection of writers. It is an integral part of the Anglo-American web of human rights and democracy advocacy NGOs and private organizations used to achieve defined geopolitical goals of its sponsors … a network of private U.S. and European foundations. [Among them is Freedom House.] …It aims to create something it calls a ‘world culture.’ That smells suspiciously like the Anglo-American theme of ‘Global Governance’ or David Rockefeller’s ‘New World Order’.53 nce removed from the individuals involved with the project, WikiLeaks’ mandate takes an even grizzlier dip into the world of smoke and mirrors.

Our primary interests are oppressive regimes in Asia, the former Soviet bloc, Sub-Sa haran Africa and the Middle East, but we also expect to be of assistance to those in the west who wish to reveal unethi cal behavior in their own governments and corporations.”54 On the death of Roosevelt in April 1945, “President Harry Truman ordered General Eisenhower to prepare secret plans for a nuclear strike on some 20 cities of the Soviet Union.56 The secret war plan was code-named TOTALITY. (JIC 329/1) Warplan TOTALITY was the first American plan to obliterate the Russian Heartland. It would by no means be the last. The Pentagon plan TOTALITY was never implemented. The detonation by the Soviet Union of its own atomic bomb in August 1949 caught the United States planners by total surprise. With the destruction of the Soviet Union in 1991, the US military industrial faction around the Pentagon and the US policy elites were ready to make a new try at achieving nuclear “first strike” superiority.57 Russia’s deconstruction in the 1990s reminds us how easily you can defeat a powerful nuclear-armed enemy without firing a shot. It can be done through a combination of military and economic pressure with new tools such as NGOs, psychological warfare and fifth-column traitors, all run through allies within the very bosom of the Russian government. France in 1940 found itself embroiled in a similar situation, during the Nazi offensive, undermined by subversive synarchist elements within its own military. The secret war against Putin’s Russia took shape during the 2003 – 2004 period, that is, after Iraq and the Yukos affair – as the United States sights were once again turned to the defeat of Russia. American political leaders realized that geopolitical military conflict used against Yeltsin’s Russia in the 1990s, based on agreements between the United States government, ‘Yeltsin’s Family’, high level cronies in Yeltsin’s entourage and the Russian army would be an utter failure with Putin at the helm. The essence of the agreements: Russia becomes America’s junior partner with the country’s raw materials included in the comprehensive settlement package in exchange for the ‘stabilization’ of the country. But Putin turned out to be a competent leader and a relentless negotiator, managing to play the Americans by refusing to support its attack on Iraq, while playing a clever game of pragmatism, flexibility and performance between Bush and the Franco-German duopoly of Chirac-Schroeder.

By December 2004, that plan had failed miserably, and both the U.S. and Britain realized that neither their reprehensible operations such as murdering of school-children in Beslan, nor their orange revolutions or guerrilla warfare in the North Caucasus were going to dislodge Putin from his presidential seat. In 2007, the unfinished business, as leading US policy circles saw it, was still to accomplish the utter and complete dismemberment of Russia as an independent nation state. “Nuclear missiles were but one piece of a vast arsenal of weapons and deceptions being deployed to encircle and ultimately destroy the one force left that could prevent a Total Global American Century, the realization of what the Pentagon termed Full Spectrum Dominance.”58 What is absolutely sure is that “from the outset, WikiLeaks’ geopolitical focus on ‘oppressive regimes’ in Eurasia and the Middle East [an Orwellian double speak] was ‘appealing’ to America’s elites, i.e. it seemingly matched stated US foreign policy objectives. Moreover, the composition of the WikiLeaks team (which included Chinese dissidents), not to mention the methodology of ‘exposing secrets’ of foreign governments, were in tune with the practices of US covert operations geared towards triggering ‘regime change’ and fostering ‘color revolutions’ in different parts of the World.”59 The pattern is quite easy to pick out. On January 17, 2011, Russian President Dmitry Medvedev called Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad and reaffirmed Russia’s commitment to strengthen diplomatic ties with Iran.60 Then on January 18, Medvedev recognized Palestine as an independent state during a visit to Jericho. “So on Wednesday, the brand new WikiLeaks franchise in Russia published photos of what they claim are the billion dollar home Putin is supposedly building in Russia in an effort to embarrass the existing power structure in that country, namely Vladamir Putin, by calling them corrupt.”61 Is it me, or are we being played? Putin may very well be corrupt, what politician isn’t, but he’s a far cry from the degeneracy that existed under alcoholic and usurper Boris Yeltsin, whose reign created the dreaded Russian oligarchs and opened the country up to international speculators who literally raped the nation and stole much of her wealth. Does anyone remember that? According to Raw Story, an alleged anti-war, liberal publication, “the site opened in January 2011 and asked Russians to begin sending information on public corruption.

The greatest obstacle to discovery is not ignorance; it is the illusion of knowledge. And as Walter Lippmann said in his book titled Public Opinion, “News and the truth are not the same thing…” William Norman Grigg, in an extensive article for The New American on the inner workings of the media cartel, astutely states that “Thomas Jefferson once famously remarked that it is better to have a newspaper without a government than a government without a newspaper. The free press, in whatever manifestation – plays an indispensable role in holding government accountable to the public. But the media “cannot perform this duty if it is itself part of the ruling Establishment – the self-appointed elitists like Rockefeller who busy themselves planning the future, supposedly on behalf of the ‘whole of humanity.”63 scale.” Many Europeans reacted in a similar way when they heard certain “alarmists” outside their mainstream media claim that elitists among them had created the Common Market for the purpose of gradually building it into a government of Europe. Now that the Common Market has become the EU through a series of steps, and the EU has begun sapping political and economic powers from once-sovereign European nations, a power grab once dismissed as preposterous is widely recognized as fact. But that power grab could not have succeeded without the complicity of the media moguls on both sides of the Atlantic, who portrayed earlier manifestations of the EU as a “free trade” agreement, thereby providing protective coloration for their counterparts in the political elite.64 The entire European edifice was and is based on lies. And as the European Union is crumbling into dust before our very eyes, these lies are being accentuated by the actions of the elite against the needs of its citizens. For example, “We were told, first of all, that the Lisbon Treaty is not the same as the original EU Constitutional Treaty. Come on, guys: everybody knows that the two texts are so similar that any claim to the contrary is either sophistry or an outright lie. “It is true that some European leaders have joined in the sophistry to claim that the two documents are not the same.

This is a moot point, to say the least: the deal establishes a permanent EU presidency, an EU foreign minister, wide-ranging extensions of qualified majority voting, dramatic changes to the ‘passerelle’ or escalator system which enables the European Council unilaterally to extend its powers, and – perhaps above all – the Charter of Fundamental Rights, the precise legal significance of which For- ontrol over the media has been a long-term objective of the globalist elite. In February, 1917, Congressman Oscar Callaway placed a statement in the Congressional Record describing the origins of what he called the ‘newspaper combination.’ According to that account, the J.P. Morgan Banking interests and their allies ‘got together 12 men high up in the newspaper world and employed them to select the most influential newspapers in the United States and [the] sufficient number of them to control generally the policy of the daily press in the United States.’” Beginning with a list of 179 papers, the 12 men pared down the list. Ultimately, the cabal “found it was only necessary to purchase control of 25 of the greatest papers. The 25 papers were agreed upon; emissaries were sent to purchase the policy, national and international, of these papers; an agreement was reached; the policy of the papers was bought, to be paid for by the month; an editor was furnished for each paper to properly supervise and edit information … [on matters] considered vital to the interests of the purchasers.”66 And as Marie Louise writes in “Operation Mockingbird: CIA Media Manipulation,” “This concentration of ownership and power reduces the diversity of media voices, as news falls into the hands of large conglomerates with holdings in many industries that interferes in newsgathering, because of conflicts of interest.”67 Right believes the Communists act.

Grigg continues: “The ‘Round Table Groups’ stemmed from a secret society (Quigley’s phrase) created by British magnate Cecil Rhodes to unite the world – beginning with the Englishspeaking dominions – under ‘enlightened’ elitists like himself. World War I and the postwar proposal for a League of Nations resulted from the Round Table cabal’s machinations. During the post-war Versailles ‘Peace Conference,’ noted Quigley, this covert network decided to establish ‘in England and in each dominion, a front organization to the existing Round Table Group. This front organization, called the Royal Institute of International Affairs, had as its nucleus in each area the existing submerged Round Table Group. In New York it was known as the Council on Foreign Relations….’”69 John Galt in his Beating the New World Order explains: “On February 5, 1891, Cecil Rhodes established a secret society called the Circle of Initiates. Like most secret organizations, it had one individual or a very small group at the center and was surrounded by a series of concentric circles of outer members who were not privy to the secrets of the core but who supported its objectives.… There was an outer circle called the Association of Helpers, also called the Round Table Groups.”70 nard Keynes, [economic historian] Arnold Toynbee, [Nazi supporter and former U.S. Secretary of State] John Foster Dulles and others into a publicly acknowledged formal council now known as Institute of International Affairs.… The conspirators decide to break down the Institute of International Affairs into an American branch, the Council on Foreign Relations, and a British branch, the Royal Institute for International Affairs.”71 “Carroll Quigley, like David Rockefeller, specifically identified the New York Times and the Washington Post as key media organs of the power elite.”72 The Washington Post, founded by Eugene Meyer is the voice of official Washington, and has always stood for a weak presidency and ultimately for a strong Federal Reserve.

The current New York Times chairman Arthur Sulzberger Jr. is a member of the Council on Foreign Relations, son of Arthur Ochs Sulzberger and grandson of Arthur Hays Sulzberger who served as a Trustee for the Rockefeller Foundation. Ethan Bronner, deputy foreign editor of the New York Times as well as Thomas Friedman among others are also members of the Council on Foreign Relations (CFR).74 “America’s corporate media and more specifically The New York Times are an integral part of the economic establishment, with links to Wall Street, the Washington think tanks and the Council on Foreign Relations (CFR).”75 CFR is a US arm of the powerful and secretive Bilderberg Group. It is also, “the premier U.S. foreign policy think tank in the United States, and is one of the central institutions for socializing American elites from all major sectors of society (media, banking, academia, military, intelligence, diplomacy, corporations, NGOs, civil society, etc.), where they work together to construct a consensus on major issues related to American imperial interests around the world. As such, the CFR often sets the strategy for American policy, and wields enormous influence within policy circles, where key players often and almost always come from the rank and file of the CFR itself.”76 CFR’s former President, Sir Winston Lord, made an interesting observation when he said that “The Trilateral Commission doesn’t secretly run the world. The Council on Foreign Relations does that.”77 The organization boasts a membership of about 4,000. “But its roster includes literally hundreds of powerful figures occupying key positions in the media – not merely writers, reporters, and news anchors who deliver the news, but also editors, publishers, and executives who define what news is and how it is covered. Just as significantly, the tiny CFR clique has for decades had a virtual stranglehold on the executive branch of the U.S. government, as well as much of academia.”78 In his October 30, 1993 ‘Ruling Class Journalists’ essay, Washington Post ombudsman Richard Harwood candidly remarked about how the CFR dominates our news media. Harwood described the council as “the closest thing we have to a ruling Establishment in the United States….

He went on to describe CFR representation among the owners, management, and edito- rial personnel for the other media giants – the New York Times, Wall Street Journal, Los Angeles Times, NBC, CBS, ABC, and so on. These media heavyweights “do not merely analyze and interpret foreign policy for the United States; they help make it,” he concluded.… Rather than offering an independent perspective on our rulers’ actions, the Establishment media act as the ruling elite’s voice – conditioning the public to accept, and even embrace, Insider designs that otherwise might not be politically attainable.79 Saturation reporting from a crisis region; emergency calls for help broadcast on the electronic media (such as the one recently on the BBC Radio 4 flagship Today programme); televised pictures of refugees; lurid stories of “mass rapes,” which are surely designed to titillate as much to provoke outrage; reproachful evocations of the Rwandan genocide; demands that something must be done (“How can we stand idly by?,” etc.); editorials [in the CFR run New York Times, the Washington Post, Newsweek, Time magazine and in CFR’s own Foreign Policy magazine with long winded opinion pieces by Bilderberg-CFR member Zbiegniew Brzezinski] in the Daily Telegraph calling for a return to the days of Rudyard Kipling’s benevolent imperialism; and, finally, the announcement that plans are indeed being drawn up for an intervention.81 ports for GlobalResearch on February 7, 2007, “First: create instability and chaos that gives the appearance of Arabs fighting Africans (it’s always those other people over there killing each other).

Again and again, as the evidence mounts, I keep coming back to the same question. Is there something wrong with the picture? The Role of the Corporate Media “WikiLeaks was started up in December 2006. Oddlyenough, as a supposed ‘leak’ site, a dissident site, it was given a great deal of immediate mainstream attention from the likes of the Washington Post, Time magazine, and even Cass Sunstein, the now Obama administration official who wrote a paper on how to ‘cognitively infiltrate’ dissident groups in order to steer them in a direction that is useful to the powers that be.”89 Scott Creighton makes a great point in his December 11, 2010 globalresearch.ca article. “The Time magazine article is curious because it seems that right off the bat they were telling us how to interpret WikiLeaks in such a way that sounded strangely familiar to George W. Bush back just after 9/11…”90 This is what a real world would look like if only what we are being told by Time magazine was written for the benefit of the readers instead of it being a cheap trick to convince the unaware masses of WikiLeaks real agenda. “By March, more than one million leaked documents from governments and corporations in Asia, the Middle East, sub-Saharan Africa and the former Soviet Bloc will be available online in a bold new collective experiment in whistle-blowing. That is, of course, as long as you don’t accept any of the conspiracy theories brewing that WikiLeaks.org could be a front for the CIA or some other intelligence agency.”91 So why would Time magazine be writing about them in the first place if they hadn’t done anything yet? [Why are they going out on a limb in a such a risky way, unless of course they know something we don’t.] Also, let’s not pass up on that", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:WL0003SearchInside_cleaned.txt:17:c2c657d9f1dc", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 6522, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "WL0003SearchInside_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/Deconstructing-Wikileaks-Daniel-Estulin/dp/1937584119", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "WL0003SearchInside_cleaned", "chunk_index": 18, "text": "in whistle-blowing.

[Why are they going out on a limb in a such a risky way, unless of course they know something we don’t.] Also, let’s not pass up on that delicious irony: this is Time magazine singing the praises of a supposed ‘leak’ site which will supposedly expose all kinds of ‘conspiracy theories’ while at the same time telling their readers NOT to believe in those silly ‘conspiracy theories’ circulating about WikiLeaks. Just so long as you believe the ‘correct’ conspiracy theories, you’ll be all right I guess. This of course perfectly matches Julian Assange’s own statements about 9/11.92 Sounds like a WikiLeaks “How To” guide. Please understand you are being told what to think and how to interpret the information. Of course, in order to interpret it ‘correctly’ you must have the right mindset. But, in order to get the unsuspecting public into the right mindset, WikiLeaks needed the official blessing of the leading mainstream corporate media publications. Without the public’s support, this little project looked doomed to fail before it even got off the ground. Is that why Rupert Murdoch’s public relations guy was on the board of directors of WikiLeaks? Is that the reason both Time magazine and the Washington Post had to come out with supportive articles about WikiLeaks before anyone knew anything about them? “This collaboration between WikiLeaks and selected mainstream media is not fortuitous; it was part of an agreement between several major US and European newspapers [The New York Times (Bilderberg, CFR), the Guardian (the left wing of the British intelligence agencies), Der Spiegel (Bilderberg) and to a lesser degree with the London Economist (Bilderberg) ] and WikiLeaks’ editor Julian Assange.”95 These large corporations are “directly involved in the editing and selection of leaked documents.”96 In other words, the press and Assange are partners. “The Economist has a close relationship to Britain’s financial elites.”98 “The Economist started publishing in the heyday of the British East India Empire in 1843; that it intervened regularly in American politics, including against Abraham Lincoln’s efforts to save the Union; and that it today rep- The Economist is jointly owned by Britain’s Rothschild family and Lazard Frères banking houses, both close to Britain’s royal family. “Sir Evelyn Robert Adrian de Rothschild was chairman of The Economist from 1972 to 1989.

He was also one of the 12 founding members of the Synarchist Movement of Empires, the secret organization behind the delivery of France over to Hitler and the Nazis. Lazard Fréres was the French investment bank for Shell, and it was in that capacity that Lazard was instrumental in the creation of the banking arm of the Worms group, Banque Worms et Cie.”102 It is also worth mentioning another important link. Julian Assange’s lawyer Mark Stephens of Finers Stephens Innocent (FSI), a major London elite law firm, happens to be the legal adviser to the Rothschild Waddesdon Trust. While this in itself does not prove anything, it should nonetheless be examined in the broader context of WikiLeaks’ social and corporate entourage: the NYT, the CFR, the Bilderberg group, The Economist, Time magazine, Forbes, Finers Stephens Innocent (FSI), etc.104 “Is WikiLeaks part of an awakening of public opinion, of a battle against the lies and fabrications, which appear daily in the print media and on network TV?”105 Or is it a part of a process of infiltrating alternative media, critical of the government’s way of handling the US foreign policy? How can this battle against media disinformation be waged with the participation and collaboration of the corporate architects of media disinformation? Starting in the early days of the Cold War (late 40s), the CIA began a secret project called Operation Mockingbird, an Government, author Alex Constantine explains it as a “CIA project designed to influence the major media for domestic propaganda purposes.” Washington Post reporter, Carl Bernstein – who came to fame with his colleague Bob Woodward, for their exposé of the Nixon administration’s illegal re-election campaign activities, known as “Watergate” – dropped a media bombshell on an unsuspecting America.

In an October 1977 article published by Rolling Stone magazine, Bernstein reported that more than 400 American journalists worked for the CIA. Bernstein went on to reveal that this cozy arrangement had covered the preceding 25 years. Sources told Bernstein that the New York Times, America’s most respected newspaper at the time, was one of the CIA’s closest media collaborators. Seeking to spread the blame, the New York Times published an article in December 1977, revealing that “more than eight hundred news and public information organizations and individuals,” had participated in the CIA’s covert subversion of the media.107 These “collaborators,” provided the CIA with direct access to a large number of newspapers and magazines, scores of news services and press agencies such as Reuters and the Associated Press, radio and television as well as Hollywood studios. Media assets will eventually include ABC, NBC, CBS, Time, Newsweek, Associated Press, United Press International (UPI), Reuters, Hearst Newspapers, Scripps-Howard, Copley News Service, etc. and 400 journalists, who have secretly carried out assignments according to documents on file at CIA headquarters, from intelligence-gathering to serving as gobetweens. This information became public knowledge in 1975, as a result of the investigation by U.S. Senator Frank Church, through the Select Committee on Governmental Operations Studies on the Intelligence Agencies. The most important individual prostituting himself on behalf of the CIA was legendary journalist Walter Cronkite, a former intelligence officer himself and a paragon of journalistic virtue. Constantine reveals in an Internet essay.[110] Citing historian C. Vann Woodward’s New York Times article of 1987, Ronald Reagan, later to become President of the US, was a FBI snitch earlier in his life. This dated back to the time when Reagan was President of the Actor’s Guild. Woodward says that Reagan “fed the names of suspect people in his organization to the FBI secretly and regularly enough to be assigned an informer’s code number, T.10.” The purpose was to purge the film industry of “subversives.”111 British investigator David Guyatt goes even further: “One journalist is worth twenty agents, a high-level source told Bernstein. Spies were trained as journalists and then later infiltrated – often with the publishers consent – into the most prestigious media outlets in America, including the New York Times and Time magazine. Likewise, numerous reputable journalists underwent training in various aspects of ‘spook-craft’ by the CIA. This included techniques as varied as secret writing, surveillance and other spy crafts.”112 The Washington Post was the key media outlet for off-thebook CIA information, and the individual chosen for the job of disinformation in the Post was a then-unknown Bob", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:WL0003SearchInside_cleaned.txt:20:2a1ee21f27af", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 6525, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "WL0003SearchInside_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/Deconstructing-Wikileaks-Daniel-Estulin/dp/1937584119", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "WL0003SearchInside_cleaned", "chunk_index": 21, "text": "later infiltrated – often with the publishers consent – into the most prestigious media outlets in America, including the New York Times and Time magazine.

Woodward’s finest hour was Watergate, which toppled Richard Nixon. What is almost unknown is how the mainstream media account of Watergate was different from the one told by Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein. n his publisher’s forward for Watergate Exposed, Trine-I Day’s publisher Kris Millegan writes: “Bob Woodward was no ordinary news reporter, As Russ Baker, author of Family of Secrets states at whowhatwhy.com: ‘Bob, top secret Naval officer, gets sent to work in the Nixon White House while still on military duty. Then, with no journalistic credentials to speak of, and with a boost from White House staffers, he lands a job at the Washington Post. Not long thereafter he starts to take down Richard Nixon. Meanwhile, Woodward’s military bosses are running a spy ring inside the White House that is monitoring Nixon and Kissinger’s secret negotiations with America’s enemies (China, Soviet Union, etc), stealing documents and funnelling them back to the Joint Chiefs of Staff.’” In this new book on Watergate, co-author Robert Merritt, a man without a face and the FBI’s most important informant in the last half-century, reveals that the CIA conducted illegal wiretaps of all key politicians in Washington. This is the information that Woodward, over the years, has managed to use in his books to get rid of pesky politicians and other challengers that made life difficult for the Shadow n the words of Canadian economist, Michel Chossu-I dovsky, “Media disinformation has become institutionalized in the XXI century. The lies and fabrications have become increasingly blatant when compared to the 1970s. The US media has become the mouthpiece of US foreign policy. Disinformation is routinely ‘planted’ by CIA operatives in the newsroom of major dailies, magazines and TV channels.”114 Quoting Chaim Kupferberg: “A relatively few well-connected correspondents provide the scoops, that get the coverage in the relatively few mainstream news sources, where the parameters of debate are set and the ‘official reality’ is consecrated for the bottom feeders in the news chain.”115 Since 2001, the US media has assumed a new role in sustaining the ‘Global War on Terrorism’ (GWOT) and camouflaging US sponsored war crimes.

[emphasis added] WikiLeaks has the essential features of a process of ‘manufactured dissent.’ It seeks to expose government lies. It has released important information on US war crimes. But once the project becomes embedded in the mould of mainstream journalism, it is used as an instrument of media disinformation: ‘It is in the interest of the corporate elites to accept dissent and protest as a feature of the system inasmuch as they do not threaten the established social order. The purpose is not to repress dissent, but, on the contrary, to shape and mould the protest movement, to set the outer limits of dissent. To maintain their legitimacy, the economic elites favour limited and controlled forms of opposition… To be effective, however, the process of ‘manufacturing dissent’ must be carefully regulated and monitored by those who are the object of the protest movement. It no longer relies on the outright suppression of the facts regarding US-NATO war crimes. Nor does it require that the reputation of government officials at the highest levels, including the Secretary of State, be protected. New World Order politicians are in a sense ‘disposable’. They can be replaced. What must be protected and sustained are the interests of the economic elites, which control the political apparatus from behind the scenes. In the case of WikiLeaks, the facts are contained in a data bank; many of those facts, particularly those pertaining to foreign governments serve US foreign policy interests. Other facts tend, on the other hand to discredit the US administration. That adds to the WikiLeaks standing amongst most people who believe them to be an antiestablishment organ for the truth.116 All the Wiki-facts are selectively redacted, they are then ‘analyzed’ and interpreted by a media which serves the economic elites.

While the numerous pieces of information contained in the WikiLeaks data bank are accessible, the broader public will not normally take the trouble to consult and scan through the WikiLeaks data bank. The public will read the redacted selections and interpretations presented in major news outlets. A partial and biased picture is presented. The redacted version is accepted by public opinion because it is based on what is heralded as a ‘reliable source’, when in fact what is presented in the pages of major newspapers and on network TV is a carefully crafted and convoluted distortion of the truth. Limited forms of critical debate and ‘transparency’ are tolerated while also enforcing broad public acceptance of the basic premises of US foreign policy, including its “Global War on Terrorism.” With regard to a large segment of the US antiwar movement, this strategy seems to have succeeded: ‘We are against war but we support the ‘war on terrorism.’117 Let’s analyze this. The big lie of the 21^(st) century is terrorism itself – al-Qaeda and Osama bin Laden. One can judge the validity of information by what is hidden rather than what is revealed. Does WikiLeaks say anything about bin Laden? According to the papers that Assange has released, bin Laden at the time was allegedly in Quetta, taking part in Quetta Shura, the Council of the alleged terrorist chiefs. So, the subliminal message from the government is ‘we have to go into Pakistan and get him.’ According to WikiLeaks, up until his alleged death at the hands of United States SEALs, Osama bin Laden was very much alive, conveniently maintaining the myth for the American administration and its “War on Terror at a point when most Americans had forgotten the original reason the Bush Administration allegedly invaded Afghanistan.”118 Readers should recall that the supposed reason for the invasion was to go after Bin Laden as the mastermind of 9/11. “With its own versions of a certain search engine and a certain online encyclopedia, the intelligence community is evolving its use of tools now widespread in the commercial sector, generating both success and controversy. The new tools include a federated search engine called Oogle and Intellipedia, a controversial intelligence data-sharing tool based on Wiki social software technology.”119 With thousands of pages written about him, Julian As-sange has suddenly become a bright light of truth as a result of his spectacular media coup.

WikiLeaks has apparently placed nearly every country in the world in an uncomfortable position. No nation has been spared embarrassment – not governments nor intelligence agencies or top bosses of the world’s large multinationals. Drug traffickers, weapons dealers, diamond traders, terrorists, businessmen, clergy and Obama’s government officials fear revelations from a man who, until very recently, was a complete unknown. But who is he? Where did he come from? Assange seems to have materialized out of nowhere. No past, no history. to the President, had committed a large contingent of agents to crack the Assange riddle. The British MI6 is dipping into its emergency budget to discover the identity of leakers. It is not often that so many governments and intelligence agencies have devoted so many of their resources and efforts to unearth the truth about one person. Sources at the NSA, America’s largest spy agency, place Assange in Hamburg during the first Gulf War. Russian intelligence services, instead, place him at a cyber hacker party in Singapore in October 1986. CIA sources, however, are convinced that Assange has been recruited by several intelligence agencies, including the Israeli Mossad, through a Jewish computer scientist at the University of Melbourne, who was involved with the community of hackers and simultaneously worked for the Israeli Mossad. There is little reliable data on Assange. He is supposedly 40 years old, but if he works for some of the intelligence agencies as their front man, we can be sure that his ‘urban legend’ is built on a healthy dose of smoke and mirrors. What little is known about him, is that Assange is a superhacker associated with Chaos Computer Club in Hamburg, Germany in the late 1980s. The leader of the group, Karl Koch was a legendary hacker who invented a famous Trojan virus that destroyed many of the U.S. government’s military computers. At that time, Koch was already in the crosshairs of German intelligence because he was trying to sell the operating system source code to the Soviet KGB. In what is considered to have been one of the biggest espionage scandals of the time, five West German hackers sold military and economic intelligence to the Soviet Union after infiltrating secret data networks, such as U.S. nuclear weapons lab in Los Alamos, home of NASA, the databases of the U.S. military, as well as the database OPTIMIS of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.

The Soviets received five disks with secret information between May and December 1986, at an undisclosed location in East Berlin. These discs contained thousands of passwords and computer codes, access mechanisms and programs that allowed the Soviet Union access to computer centers in the Western world. For many people within the underworld of computer hackers, Karl Koch, alias Hagbard, was a genius, a visionary who spent most of his short life fighting personal demons and ghosts. Many consider him the inventor of the Trojan virus, at the time an unknown cyber enemy, capable of breeching the supposedly impenetrable defenses of American and European security agencies. Koch, extremely paranoid even before he became a cocaine addict, would later sell the priceless information to the Soviet KGB in the last days of the Cold War. His mother died of cancer in 1976. His father, an alcoholic, could hardly serve as a role model for Koch. To escape from real life, Koch crossed into the parallel world of the Illuminati Trilogy by Robert Anton Wilson and Robert Shea, a strange mix of conspiracy theories and secret societies, reality and fiction. In fact, his nickname was the name of a character in the book. According to sources in the KGB, in mid-1986, Karl Koch told several friends at a hacker party that he was offered a hard-to-turn-down deal that would solve his financial problems. One of those present according to the Federal Security Service of the Russian Federation (FSB), was the founder of WikiLeaks, Julian Assange. Another individual whose name appears in the archives of the KGB is the programmer Dirk Brezinski of West Berlin. KGB reports describe Brezinski as a computer genius who worked part time for the mainframe operating system, Siemens – BS-2000. According to KGB intelligence, Dirk Brezinski and Assange met in Singapore in 1994. Over time, Assange became one of the most recognizable faces on the Planet. Koch wasn’t so lucky. He died on May 23, 1989 when police found his badly burned body, covered in tattoos and phallic symbols, in a forest near Gifhorn. The police report speaks of suicide, but with Koch’s background, many speculate that it was a terrible payback by someone linked to an intelligence agency.

The police report speaks of suicide, but with Koch’s background, many speculate that it was a terrible payback by someone linked to an intelligence agency. However, the list of hackers with links to secret service agencies, interlocked objectives, triple agents and longrange government agendas gets even wackier. “It is no secret that hackers are often recruited by governmental authorities for cyber security purposes.”121 KGB recruiting of Karl Koch is just one example. Peiter Zatko a.k.a. “Mudge” is another individual existing in this lunatic fringe. In an interview with Forbes magazine, Assange made the following observations regarding his connection to Peiter Zatko: Let’s see if we can help Julian Assange remember. Business Wire’s February 1, 2005 article on the subject is candid and largely on target. It is quoted by Julie Lévesque in his Who’s Who at WikiLeaks? “Peiter Zatko is an expert in cyber warfare. He worked for BBN Technolgies (a subsidiary of Raytheon) with engineers who perform leading edge research and development to protect Department of Defense data… Mr. Zatko is focused on anticipating and protecting against the next generation of information and network security threats to government and commercial networks.”123 Lévesque’s article continued: There also seems to be a connection between Zatko and former hacker Jacob Appelbaum, a WikiLeaks spokesperson. Zatko and Appelbaum were purportedly part of a hacker group called Cult of the Dead Cow. Appelbaum currently works for the Tor Project, a United States Naval Research Laboratory initiative. The sponsors of that project listed on its website are: According to DARPA’s own web page, it’s mission “is to maintain the technological superiority of the U.S. military and prevent technological surprise from harming our national security by sponsoring revolutionary, high-payoff research bridging the gap between fundamental discoveries and their military use.”125 However, delving deeper, we find DARPA involved in development of a frightening technology with horrific implications. An August 3, 2003 Boston Globe story specifically discussed, “Defence Department funding brain-machine work.” In it the writer states, “It does not take much imagination to see in this the makings of a “Matrix”-like cyberpunk dystopia: chips that impose false memories, machines that scan for wayward thoughts, cognitively augmented government security forces that impose a ruthless order on a recalcitrant population.”126 Back in the 1950s, “DARPA was the dominant sponsor of computer-related research. Cold War-driven projects like SAGE (Semi Automatic Ground Environment), an automated air-defence network of unmanned jet planes, led to a growing interest in war gaming That hope would take form in such later projects as DARPA’s Augmented Cognition (Aug-Cog) to create soldier-computer ‘dyads,’ and the movement for a ‘Post-Human Renaissance,’ where ‘there are no demarcations", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:WL0003SearchInside_cleaned.txt:26:8c854b5c36e4", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 6531, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "WL0003SearchInside_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/Deconstructing-Wikileaks-Daniel-Estulin/dp/1937584119", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "WL0003SearchInside_cleaned", "chunk_index": 27, "text": "augmented government security forces that impose a ruthless order on a recalcitrant population.”126 Back in the 1950s, “DARPA was the dominant sponsor of computer-related research.

This would become the Holy Grail of the front-end research that has spun off not only future battlefield technologies, but also much of today’s video game industry.128 A 1997 report entitled ‘Modeling and Simulation: Linking Entertainment and Defense,’ summarized the proceedings of a National Research Council conference which brought together representatives from the military and entertainment world. Their goal was to map out a working relationship whereby the same cutting-edge simulations and virtual reality research brought to bear on enhanced training programs for the military, could also be used in commercially developed video games. Such would be the mission of the Institute for Creative Technologies (ICT). …the ultimate aim, explicitly outlined by some of ICT’s creators, is to actually construct Star Trek’s ‘holodeck’ (the holographic simulations room used on the TV show), …whose research includes the role of video-game play on performance in simulated environments: ‘Recent neurobiological studies have found that emotional experiences stimulate mechanisms that enhance the creation of long-term memories. Thus, more effective training scenarios can be designed by incorporating key emotional cues.’ Creating memories is exactly what simulation The training techniques being designed by today’s “visionaries” in virtual technologies and artificial intelligence are, in reality, based on nothing more than the reductionist belief that the human mind is a programmable system, not fundamentally different from an animal or machine. The age of cyborgs, according to DARPA and ICT is just around the corner.129 hen there is Assange the author. As investigative jour-T nalist Julie Lévesque explained in globalresearch on December 20, 2010: “In … Underground: Hacking, Madness and Obsession on the Electronic Frontier (1997) … From the start, Assange states that he undertook the research for the book; however, he fails to mention that he was actually one of the hackers analyzed in the book,” going by the name of Mendax, a Latin word for “‘lying, false….’”130 Also, according to former NSA intelligence agent and investigative journalist Wayne Madsen, Assange claims to be a PhD. But “Asian intelligence sources point out that Assange’s “PhD” is from Moffett University, an on-line diploma mill that dispatches university degrees for a fee. At the beginning of his career, he claimed to come from Nairobi, Kenya, when he actually is from Australia where his exploits have included computer hacking and software piracy.”131 WikiLeaks purports to protect all leakers’ identities", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:WL0003SearchInside_cleaned.txt:27:5259dcc9f17f", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 6532, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "WL0003SearchInside_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/Deconstructing-Wikileaks-Daniel-Estulin/dp/1937584119", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "WL0003SearchInside_cleaned", "chunk_index": 28, "text": "“‘lying, false….’”130 Also, according to former NSA intelligence agent and investigative journalist Wayne Madsen, Assange claims to be a PhD.

In February 2011, Reuters reported that “WikiLeaks’ ability to receive new leaks has been crippled af- Nice deception, but not true. Cryptome.org, “the site set up to publish information about communications security,”133 released a series of lawful spying guides to internet service providers which show how they co-operate with law enforcement and government and each other in gathering information on their users, for commercial and governmental purposes. What does this information tell the public? It shows that privacy policies put up by Internet providers and web sites are completely phony and deceptive. “There is no such thing as privacy on the Internet,” candidly states Cryptome’s founder John Young in an interview on The Brian Lehrer TV Show. “The data collection begins with you signing up to the Internet. If you have been on it for at least a year, there is nothing about you that is not known.”134 There is none that is not superficial and illusory. Security and/or privacy policy for the Internet and digital communication are unbelievable. Digital communication should be seen as a spying machine. The Internet is a magnificently appealing means to gather data on its bewitched users – for harvesting by governments, commerce, institutions and individuals, but especially by the providers of Internet services, distribution systems and equipment.135 “Not so,” says Young. “There is no place where a takedown cannot occur. The distribution system for communication can always be blocked and servers confiscated. Only multiple, growing and changing public outlets for prohibited information can offer a chance of avoiding shutdown, demonization, corruption through finance and bribery and orchestrated distrust.”136 In Underground: Hacking, Madness and Obsession on the Electronic Frontier, Assange begins with the following Oscar Wilde quote: “Man is least himself when he talks in his own person. Give him a mask, and he will tell you the truth.” And this quote from a French writer Antoine De Saint-Exupery, best remembered for his novella The Little Prince: “What is essential is invisible to the eye.” ne of the obvious questions about Assange is, who pays Ohim?

This is surely not a typical profile of a happy-go-lucky young man. Rather, it is a profile of a spy, or rather a picaresque agent. sident that I know of currently hanging out on the multi-million dollar estate of an establishment blue-blood with connections to George Soros. Assange spent a lovely Christmas holiday in Ellington Hall, the estate of Vaughan Smith, the man who owns and operates the Frontline Club. International globalist, Bilderberg member and speculator extraordinaire, George Soros, helped Smith set up the Frontline Club. When you consider that every single ‘WikiLeak’ released to this day does nothing except build support for globalist agendas, this connection seems beyond obvious in its implications.”138 In an email to John Young, one WikiLeaks insider also raises the question of Assange’s credibility: “Julian Assange’s very public fund raising campaign has effectively stalled with past and potential investors fading into the background. As previously indicated it is NOT the philosophy of WikiLeaks that is in question, but Assange’s credibility.”140 His bio states that he is a “prolific programmer and consultant for many open-source projects and his software is used by most large organizations and is inside every Apple computer.”141 Was he working freelance? Who did he work for? Does Apple know he was working for them? Apple is certainly denying it. Is this like his PhD from a phantom on-line university? Or is it simply his narcissistic fixation dominating his personality?

Assange lived for a time on tiny Magnetic Island off the coast of Australia. He was home-schooled, grew up riding horses and making rafts, and when he was eight his mom hooked up with a musician. Things got weird: “The musician became abusive, she says, and they separated. A fight ensued over the custody of Assange’s half-brother, and Claire felt threatened, fearing that the musician would take away her son. Assange recalled her saying, ‘Now we need to disappear,’ and he lived on the run with her from the age of eleven to sixteen. When I asked him about the experience, he told me that there was evidence that the man belonged to a powerful cult called the Family-its motto was ‘Unseen, Unknown, and Unheard.’ Some members were doctors who persuaded mothers to give up their newborn children to the cult’s leader, Anne Hamilton-Byrne. The cult had moles in government, Assange suspected, who provided the musician with leads on Claire’s whereabouts.”146 All of this is a classic cover for intelligence agency mindcontrol program. Some point to an alleged infamous CIArun operation called Project Monarch, which was imported from Nazi Germany under its old name, Marionette Programming. “Project Monarch is a U.S. Defense Department code name assigned to a subsection of the Central Intelligence Agency’s double top secret projects. It is a genealogical approach to define transgenerational (via genetic psychology) behavioral modification through trauma based psychological mind control, especially in children.”148 The basic component of the Monarch program is the sophisticated manipulation of the mind, using extreme trauma to induce Multiple Personality Disorder. The original documentation on the project came from the Nazi SS Top Secret (“BLACK ARTS”) research which the U.S. government acquired at the end of World War II and subsequently renamed, US Department of Defense’s Project 63.149 In public testimony submitted to the President’s Committee on Radiation, there are amazing allegations of severe torture foisted on Canadian, American, British and Australian children. These same children were used in radiation experiments. They detail the drug and traumatic methodology of sophisticated mind control as part of the CIA’s MK-ULTRA program.150 to memory, and to volition.

Indeed, some of the CIA’s subprojects included research among the psychics, the mediums, the magicians and the witches of America and beyond. And the Army was not far behind in its mind control testing, either. What was even more disturbing was the revelation that nearly all records of this incredible and superhumanly ambitious project were destroyed in 1973 on orders of the CIA director Richard Helms himself. In his testimony, he claimed that MK-ULTRA did not come up with anything worthwhile, and that the project had been terminated. Then, why were the documents shredded? We do know, however, that some of America’s more colorful criminals have spent time at the same institutions receiving CIA MK-ULTRA funding for this ‘special testing.’ People like Charles Manson and Henry Lee Lucas, as well as ‘Cinque,’ the leader of the Symbionese Liberation Army that kidnapped heiress Patty Hearst.151 While trying to make sense of the WikiLeaks lunacy, I realized that I was standing at a nexus of history and culture: Charles Manson, the unsolved murder of hacker Karl Koch, mind control experiments…and I wondered what Australian cults, American hackers, movie stars and spies, witches and prestigious foundations, Washington and occultists, al-Qaeda and drugs, bin Laden and Julian Assange, had to do with any of it. MK-ULTRA was designed to do. In the former case, departments were created within Himmler’s SS to research everything from the Holy Grail, mystical runes to Icelandic sagas and the World Ice Theory. In the case of MK-ULTRA, the focus was narrower at first, but soon expanded to include psychic phenomena, shamanism, remote viewing, and occult practices.”152 Our culture in the West – formed as it is by a faith in science, a reliance on the technological – has convinced us to ignore the unseen. There is a web of connections between visible events and visible, measurable phenomena that we cannot see, cannot measure – so our response has been to ignore this web in favor of what we can see and measure. The blind leading the blind. The drunk looking for his keys under the lamppost because the light is better there.153 For intelligence purposes, what was required of MK-UL-TRA was the ability to manipulate memory. Thus, what the Freudians call the ‘superego’ had to be bypassed, allowing the controller direct access to the contents of an enemy agent’s mind. That was step one. Step two would involve erasing specific pieces of information from the subject’s memory and replacing those pieces with new bits of memory, thus permitting the Agency to send that agent back into the field without any knowledge that he", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:WL0003SearchInside_cleaned.txt:32:f5f74b8d6e9b", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 6537, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "WL0003SearchInside_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/Deconstructing-Wikileaks-Daniel-Estulin/dp/1937584119", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "WL0003SearchInside_cleaned", "chunk_index": 33, "text": "intelligence purposes, what was required of MK-UL-TRA was the ability to manipulate memory.

Step three: Could that enemy agent then be ‘programmed’ to commit acts on behalf of the Agency, without knowing who gave the commands or why? [Imagine the perfect spy, the perfect double agent, or even the perfect assassin.] This was the essence of the Manchurian Candidate. It is also the essence of what we know today as hypnotherapy and ‘depth’ psychoanalysis, for the psychotherapist looking for access to the patient’s unconscious layers.… What the Agency was looking for was a key that would unlock these secrets and allow unfettered access to the human mind, with or without the volunteer cooperation from the patient.154 Over the years, the CIA perfected the tests and invented a bunch of new ones, with the ostensible purpose of healing the insane. Then, CIA mind control specialists like Dr. Ewen Cameron used it to drive otherwise sane people out of their minds. Cameron believed that, “Every person is the ultimate arbiter of justice in their own conscience.” 1. Ethics. We favour, and uphold, ethical behavior in all circumstances. We do not believe in unquestioning obedience to authority in all circumstances. Every person is the ultimate arbiter of justice in their own conscience. Where injustice reigns and is enshrined in law, there is a place for principled civil disobedience.156 The idea is to completely isolate a person from his environment: have him float in water that is the same temperature as his body so there is no physical sensation, with goggles blocking all vision and earmuffs blocking all sound. With no external information source, the mind begins to turn on itself for data.… After a short time, everyone begins to hallucinate.… Not many subjects lasted more than a few hours…. According to the experts, even the strongest-willed, most adaptable individuals should not be left in such environment for more than six days, because after that time the damage done to the psyche cannot be undone.157 There is virtually no publicly available information on the Anne Hamilton-Byrne cult. Whatever exists, has been classified “Top Secret” by the Australian government. It makes one wonder why the they would do that? From what we know, it looks to be a classic CIA operation.

The “patients,” most of them children, using a deniable cut-out (Anne Hamilton-Byrne cult) were part of a ghastly experiment. Like other CIA guinea pigs under the MK-ULTRA program, they were unwitting and expendable test subjects. Was Assange part of one such experiment? These operations had a fringe benefit: since the tests were taking place outside the United States and on non-US citizens there was another layer of deniability, and responsibility for the outcome of the experiments was further removed. Another one of CIA’s many bags of tricks was a series of experiments with “psychic driving techniques, [where] a patient would be kept in [an] isolated room – the ‘sleep room’ – and would be administered some combination of drugs and electroconvulsive therapy (electroshock).… This method is, if anything, even more hellish than depatterning, and involves blasting the subject with tape recordings of verbal messages … that played in a loop for sixteen hours a day for weeks. Normally, two tapes were used: the first was a ‘negative conditioning’ tape which concentrated on the negative facts of the subject’s life, continually reinforcing these unhealthy images. This would then be replaced by a ‘positive conditioning’ tape, also in a loop, also for sixteen hours a day for weeks.”158 The end product of such a cult is a group of severely impaired people, one of which might easily be Julian Assange. There is nothing out there that can confirm unequivocally that Assange is a mind control test subject, but as of this writing, there is simply too much circumstantial evidence to discard that possibility. What he seems to have gotten out of his childhood experience is a tremendous, anti-authoritarian hatred for governments and corporations. How did this deep-rooted mistrust of authority reflect on Assange’s personal development? And how can it help us penetrate the depth of his inner self? What clues does it leave behind to the real Assange? The following email, to an unknown recipient, written by Assange on December 13, 2006, gives us a glimpse into his mindset. Based on new sources that have recently come to light, a new picture of Assange emerges, specifically dealing with his personal and political concerns. On the one hand, in the mainstream interviews he comes out cryptic, dispassionate and faintly self-important. On the other hand, as can be judged from Assange’s take on the media circus, he comes across as very media savvy: Analogously, the public sphere is warm milk, into which has leaked our culture.

Bacterial growth follows an exponential – left unmolested it would become the congealed yogurt of our desires, but random innocents and malefactors alike are injecting their their own bacterial strain into the mix. The impact of early strains of information release (ours and others) will be fantastically amplified by the exponential process. Consequently we must expend as much energies on this IMMEDIATELY as we have inorder to set path of future perceptions, which will otherwise require far more energies to correct even a day later. Since we can not seal the public sphere from the influence of others, our only recourse is to continually inject our informational strain into the ferment. If we keep our strain (our public positioning ) consistent and quotable we should come to dominate the culture when opposed by relatively random influences of others. And despite JYAs seasoned fears, our opponents thus far are essentially uncoordinated; they do not strike with vigor at the same point. Here follows our blessing. Because WL has not yet generated ANY specific enemies (at least outside of China and Somalia), attacks are generalized (“pro-censorship”) , unmotivated, limp-wristed and lack precision and common direction. and his very curious reflections on the nature of the Vietnamese psyche. To my mind, something else comes through his reflections. It took me a while to see it: The ominous flaw (the pothole), the banal hollow note, and glib hardly perceivable suggestion that love is doomed, since it can never recapture the miracle of its initial moments. Other than to catching up, would you like to join the initial advisory board of an organization that’s designing and deploying a censorship resistant version of wikipedia (mediawiki) for mass document leaking? More about that later. I want to give you time to think about what it may mean (technically and politically) in the light of John Young’s proven ability to withstand censorship of some very important, but smaller scale leaks on Cryptome. To a physicist a pothole has an interesting life. It starts out as a few loose stones. As wheels pass over, these stones grind together and against the under surface. Their edges are rounded off and the depression they are in also becomes rounder by their action. The stones become pestles to the hole’s motor. Smaller stones and grit move between the spaces of larger stones and add to the grinding action. The hole enlarges, and deepens.

Small stones are soon entirely worn away, but in the process liberate increasingly larger stones from the advancing edge of the hole. The increasing depth and surface capture more and more energy from passing wheels. The destruction of the road surface accelerates until the road is abandoned or the hole is filled. When potholes are small, the resultant political pressures are not sufficient to overcome the forces of other interests groups who compete for labour and resources. Likewise, it is difficult to motivate people who have other passions and pains in their life to go to the dentist when their teeth do not ache. Both are caused by limitations in knowledge and its distillation: foresight. Why is this surprising? It is surprising because we are used to looking at government spending through the lens of economic utility; a lens which claims the political process as a derivative. This vision claims that political forces compete for access to the treasury to further their own utility. Hence, military intelligence and public health compete with road maintenance for funding and so should attempt to minimize the latter’s drain on the treasury. But that drain is minimized by filling in potholes immediately! In intelligence agency oversight we have “The Black Budget blues,” but the phrase is probably most familiar to us as “The Fox News Effect” of the world, cognitive ability to draw predictive inferences and economic stability to give them a meaningful home. It’s not only in Vietnam where secrecy, malfeasance and unequal access have eaten into the first requirement of foresight (“truth and lots of it”). But back in the west and a land of cars, I noted that I knew only 10 people who had died; two murders, one suicide and six dead or severely brain damaged in motorcycle accidents. None from old age, which reflects my clans’ longevity and wanderlust on one hand and fractiousness on the other. I stopped riding in the land of cars.

One of the trademarks of a mind control victim is the similarity in their vocabulary, when describing certain events. Memories and suggestions are implanted without the victim’s knowledge. The mind becomes a blank slate, on which one redraws the most sinister convictions of Evil. NO-no-no Julian Assange, it does not work like that unless you wish to do intelligence agencies like the CIA a big favor – the daily 1.6 billion “everyones” email collected by American intelligence cannot be read, it is a logistical impossibility. Text extraction computing software is imperfect and pick ups by far more false leads than real leads and ‘read mails’ of those people singled out for surveilliance [sic] (like myself ) can read by more than one country’s agencies, including law enforcement (a fact for which I am personally pleased) and that is how, among other things, Italian law enforcement can bring down a criminal CIA rendition“It is actually much easier for intelligence agencies to track the physical mail system. It leaves tangible clues: postmarks, finger prints, DNA… whereas the experienced someone who is keen not to be monitored or discovered while whistle-blowing crimes (unlike myself, I do not need to conceal my identity) working inside/outside the system will leak with a untraceable to the source used or stolen laptop at a wire- less café where one can create an online email account in minutes, attach, upload and send documents in a few minutes more, abandon the mail account, wipe the drive, destroy and dispose of [dumpster] the computer and never frequent that particular wireless café again.

As I stated in my 2005 Bilderberg report, “If democ-racy is the rule of the people, secret government incompatible with democracy. The people cannot possibly rule on something they don’t know about. The whole idea of clandestine spheres of influence within the government waging secret campaigns is therefore foreign to the notion of democracy and must be fought with zealous determination lest we wish to repeat the fatal errors of the not-sodistant past.”165 Shrouded in secrecy, “WikiLeaks feels the need to reassure public opinion that it has no contacts with the intelligence community.

Ironically, it also sees the need to define the activities of the intelligence agencies and compare them to those of WikiLeaks.”166 Let’s listen to what they have to say: WikiLeaks is a project of the Sunshine Press. It’s probably pretty clear by now that WikiLeaks is not a front for any intelligence agency or government despite a rumour to that effect. This rumour was started early in WikiLeaks’ existence, possibly by the intelligence agencies themselves. WikiLeaks is an independent global group of people with a long standing dedication to the idea of a free press and the improved transparency in society that comes from this. The group includes accredited journalists, software programmers, network engineers, mathematicians and others. To determine the truth of our statements on this, simply look at the evidence. By definition, intelligence agencies want to hoard information. By contrast, WikiLeaks has shown that it wants to do just the opposite. Our track record shows we go to great lengths to bring the truth to the world without fear or favour.167 Assange has implied that rumors about any intelligence agency links should be read as none other than a sign of WikiLeaks “success.” That any campaign for the truth is but a sign of their desperation.” “Newspeak and doublethink, the totalitarian ‘reality control’ devices that Orwell described so thoroughly in 1984, don’t always take the form of the simple messages that are common to it.”168 We’ve heard this kind of reasoning before. War Is Peace, Hate Is Love, Slavery Is Freedom. Arbeit Macht Frei. Its underlying principles, after all, are the interposition of two seemingly contradictory ideas or concepts and asserting that they are identical, thereby nullifying their meanings. This concept can apply to whole reconstructions of reality – particularly in the rewriting of history that contravenes reality and substantive fact, asserting the opposite of that reality to be true, and offering distorted or utterly false evidence in support and asserting that it is true. The most notorious manifestation of vio- “Quite true. But by definition, a covert operation always pretends to be something it is not, and never claims to be what it is.”171 In other words, it can’t be identified as an official CIA project, so it must seem to be the opposite of what it is.

In her globalresearch.ca December 20, 2010 article, Julie Lévesque quotes Daniel Tencer in explaining the role played by some of the leading members of the Obama administration, especially Cass Sunstein, who heads the Obama White House’s Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs. Sunstein is also the author of a Harvard Law School essay entitled “Conspiracy Theories: Causes and Cures.” Sunstein means that people who believe in conspiracy theories have a limited number of sources of information that they trust. Therefore, Sunstein argued in the article, it would not work to simply refute the conspiracy theories in public — the very sources that conspiracy theorists believe would have to be infiltrated. non-governmental officials in the effort to rebut the theories. It might ensure that credible independent experts offer the rebuttal, rather than government officials themselves. There is a tradeoff between credibility and control, however. The price of credibility is that government cannot be seen to control the independent experts.172 In other words, Sunstein says, let’s pose as patriots online. Let’s disrupt the 9/11 Truth movement. Let’s put out our own disinformation. “The purpose is not to suppress dissent, but, on the contrary, to shape and mould the protest movement, to set the outer limits of dissent.” How? Through regulating, monitoring, limiting and controlling the opposition. “What must be protected and sustained are the interests of the economic elites, which control the political apparatus from behind the scenes.”173 Are we to believe that WikiLeaks is indeed dedicated to the principle that “seeking change, does not mean seeking or resorting to violence, but proactive effort to bring about positive change at all levels, individual and collective?”175 The old adage that the reason for war is to end war can’t be considered wise, especially when war has become the means to incite armed conflict that far surpasses the original reason for the violent struggle. Economist F. William Engdahl makes a compelling case in questioning Assange’s true intentions: “A closer exmost controversial issues of recent decades, the forces behind the September 11, 2001 attacks on the Pentagon and World Trade Center shows him to be curiously establishment.

We have published their meeting notes.’”177 Think about it. If you are coming out with revelations that the government does not want you to know, such as what really happened on 9/11, you don’t get the New York Times, the Guardian and Der Spiegel cooperating with you. Der Spiegel had a major cover story on conspiracy fanatics who turn the world upside down. The German magazine openly stated that serious investigators who are following up on 9/11 are lunatics and anti-Semites. Der Spiegel’s position seem to coincide with Assange’s position in that both of them are irritated by people investigating the greatest crime That statement from a person who has built a reputation of being anti-establishment is more than notable. First, as thousands of physicists, engineers, military professionals and airline pilots have testified, the idea that 19 barelytrained Arabs armed with box-cutters could divert four US commercial jets and execute the near-impossible strikes on the Twin Towers and Pentagon over a time period of 93 minutes with not one Air Force NORAD military interception, is beyond belief. Precisely who executed the professional attack is a matter for genuine unbiased international inquiry. Notable for Mr. Assange’s blunt denial of any sinister 9/11 conspiracy is the statement in a BBC interview by former US Senator, Bob Graham, who chaired the United States Senate Select Committee on Intelligence when it performed its Joint Inquiry into 9/11. Graham told BBC, ‘I can just state that within 9/11 there are too many secrets, that is information that has not been made available to the public for which there are specific tangible credible answers and that the withholding of those secrets has eroded public confidence in their government as it relates to their own security.’ BBC narrator: ‘Senator Graham found that the cover-up led to the heart of the administration.’ Bob Graham: ‘I called the White House and talked with Ms. Rice and said, ‘Look, we’ve been told we’re gonna get cooperation in this inquiry, and she said she’d look into it, and nothing happened.’ ongtime Obama friend, Sunstein, is an animal-rights Lcultist, who is married to National Security Council official Samantha Power.

According to Tony Papert, in Ex – ecutive Intelligence Review “He declares that animals have human-like rights and should be able to bring suit in court, through human lawyers, against violations of these rights. Animal rights? That’s really just the flip side of believing that humans are animals—animals who should be enslaved because they are irrational and therefore must be controlled. This is the bestiality and degeneracy of the British Empire being openly displayed by the Obama government aparatchiks. Picture lines of pigs wearing swastika brossards on their arms.”180 Papert goes on, “According to a Time [April 13, 2009] account, … the President has been surrounded by a collection of ’behaviorist economists,’ who have cultivated a cult-like following through the publication of such daffy economic tracts as Freakonomics, Nudge, Predictable Irrationality, The Wisdom of Crowds, and Animal Spirits. These economists, including long-time Obama advisor Cass Sunstein … have formed a tight clique … of the Pavlovian/Skinnerian kooks….”181 In fact, the crazies working within the confines of Obama’s White House “are not really economists at all, but psychological warfare specialists disguising their psywar measures as economic policy. They are all hard-core followers of the British philosophical radicalism of John Locke, Bernard de Mandeville, Adam Smith, and Jeremy Bentham, the 18th-Century creatures who argued that man is nothing more than a beast, irrationally driven by pleasure and pain.”182 No wonder Cass Sunstein fits so snugly into this group. even more of a herd of frightened sheep than we are already. Now that the financial bubble has popped, they say, it is time for a new paradigm, one which will prepare us for the coming collapse of living standards, and of population levels. These policies will be presented as positive—stopping “global warming,” learning to live simpler lives, doing with less as a way of saving the planet. Underneath this feel-good pop psychology is pure fascism.183 With the bursting of the economic bubble, the economic behaviorism also needed to change, “requiring an alteration of the brainwashing programming. Whereas the oldstyle ‘neo-classical economics,’ with its assertion that man acted in his ‘rational self-interest,’ was useful in convincing the people that the ‘markets’ knew what they were doing, and that the bubble was good for the nation and good for the people, that era has passed.”184 That’s where WikiLeaks would come in as the agent of change and propaganda.

Now the people are to be told something else: that the bubble was wrong, that we went too far, that we are killing the planet, and that changes, and sacrifices, must be made. We must be “green,” we must not only accept, but desire, a lower standard of living. We are, in effect, being prepared to pay the bill for the bailout, and for the destruction it will produce.” In other words “preparing the people for the pain is where the ‘behavioral economists’ come in.185 nineteenth and early 20th century. After the Nazi genocide, the term “eugenics” was discredited, so the same British and allied European and North American elites who backed Hitler changed the name to environmentalism and went right back into the genocide business. To illustrate the point: WWF founder Sir Julian Huxley was president of the Eugenics Society in 1961 when the WWF came into being.”186 Helga Zepp-Larouche makes it interesting when she refers to technological progress as the base of all evil for the Green Party. “In case someone requires proof that the Greens march in fascist footsteps, then one should refer to the modern identity of the argumentation of Friedrich Georg Junger in The Perfection of Technology, written in 1939.… He [Junger] warns of the dangerous illusions that are associated with technological progress.… Technology fills the air with smoke, pollutes the water, destroys forests and animals. This leads to a condition, in which Nature must be protected from rational thought.” Does that sound familiar? It should. Under the guise of global warming, we are being bombarded with this message almost daily by the mainstream press across the world. Then Junger states the following, “The technician ruins factory owners through inventions which are not anticipated. The wealth and ruin of the capitalists is as indifferent to him as that of the proletariat.”187 In reality, by cutting down productivity, through cutting down infrastructure, by cutting inventions, technology, you are forcing a collapse in population. The plan of the moneyed elite has always been to destroy the human mind because, as I explained in my European Parliament presentation on the Bilderberg group, “Human mind affects the development of the Planet. This is how mankind is measured. What separates us from animals is our ability to dis- On the other hand, the Empire of money depends upon suppression of scientific development and knowledge by keeping us backwards and dumb.

And if you keep people stupid and not too numerous, then the minority can control them. According to Bilderberg, there is no such thing as a scientific principle. The problem here is the conception of what truth is: In the Bilderberg-led system, the truth doesn’t exist. Because it is an imperialist system. No truth. Only the arrogance of power. This arrogance of power can be summed up through another one of the elite’s key initiatives in that “technology is responsible for inflation.”190 The IMF uses the same propaganda, “solely for the purpose of keeping developing nations, which want to progress with their industrialisation, under the yoke of colonialism.”191 The theses proposed by Junger at the beginning are emphasised in the following way: “We must recognise that technological progress and the education of the masses go hand in hand.” Some twenty years later, Bertrand Russell picked up on the theme of education and expanded it even further. “It [education] will be rigidly confined to the governing class…When the technique has been perfected, every government that has been in charge of education will be able to control its subjects without the need of armies or policeman.”192 In other words, “for the oligarchy, educated masses – numerous educated people – is a horrible idea, because they would end their privileged, elitist position as oligarchs, who are happy to rule over uneducated masses.”193 which have rejected the “reality” of the Boomers in favour of creating one of their own. These youth have seen what a mess their parents and grandparents made of the world and want no part of it, but they have no real sense of identity around which to properly diagnose and remedy the disaster they are inheriting. As a result, they’ve largely opted out, indifferent to the world in which they live, preferring to escape into entertainment, amusements, and narcissism.194 Looks and smells very much like Assange, a man with no real sense of identity and no theoretical basis to any of his positions. He is certainly not anti-war. He does not say that the US should get out of Afghanistan and stop interfering in Pakistan. What Assange is saying is: “whatever you want to do, be transparent and be humane.” He does not talk about imperialism. He does not talk about Anglo-American banking, New World Order; he does not talk about any concept that may allow someone to make sense of his political beliefs. There is no element of that at all.

Instead, we are subjected to a series of cute sound bites. Nothing profound, just fuzzy and warm feel-good platitudes. If you are wondering why I am asking this, the reason is quite simple. “Most people don’t know where their opinions come from.… Much of what is generally considered personal opinion is actually the result of decades of brainwashing delivered through our educational system, our entertainment and news media, the ever-present advertising, and more recently, the Internet.”196 And that’s another facet of the WikiLeaks operation we should consider. If their behavior is revealed to the public, they have one of two choices: one is to reform in such a way that they can be proud of their endeavors, and proud to display them to the public. Or the other is to lock down internally and to balkanize, and as a result, of course, cease to be as efficient as they were. To me, that is a very good outcome, because organizations can either be efficient, open and honest, or they can be closed, conspiratorial and inefficient.197 … appear to be terrified of free speech, and while one might say that means something awful is happening in the country, I actually think that is a very optimistic sign, because it means that speech can still cause reform and that the power structure is still inherently political, as opposed to fiscal. So journalism and writing are capable of achieving change, and that is why Chinese authorities are so scared of it. Whereas in the United States to a large degree, and in other Western countries, the basic elements of society have been so heavily fiscalized through contractual obligations that political change doesn’t seem to result in economic change, which in other words means that political change doesn’t result in change.198 So, according to Julian Assange, journalism and writing are capable of achieving change in China, but not in the Western world and certainly not in the United States.

The group of 29 is actually called the Behavioral Economics Roundtable, based in the Russell Sage Foundation in Washington, D.C. It is a self-selecting, self-perpetuating group, just like Cecil Rhodes’ Round Table which governed the British Empire for the Fabian Society.”200 “These foundations are offshoots of the same treasonous, pro-British networks who supported Hitler and Mussolini, created the fascist American Liberty League, and fought President Franklin Roosevelt at every turn. They were fascist then, and they are fascist now.”201 “An institutional base for the ‘behavioral economists’ is the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER), a think tank located next door to Harvard University in Cambridge, Massachusetts. NBER states that its “workshop in behavioral economics” has been sponsored since 2001 by three private firms: ‘Bracebridge Capital, Fuller & Thaler Asset Management, and LSV Asset Management.’ The smallest of the three interlocking funds, with about $1 billion in assets, is Fuller & Thaler. Its boss Richard Thaler founded and has directed the NBER program since 1991. Thaler helps coordinate the Summers gang’s policy control through Thaler’s close associates Austan Goolsbee (Obama Presidential campaign chief economist), and Cass Sunstein (Federal Regulatory Czar).… Harvard Professor Shleifer is Lawrence Summers’ protege and personal international agent. Shleifer’s own fortune is estimated in the hundred of millions, perhaps a billion dollars. This wealth was generated in the 1990s Summers/Shleifer/Harvard scandal in Russia. Summers, then a World Bank official, had sent Shleifer to Russia to run a U.S.-funded program to privatize Soviet assets into private hands. The program collapsed when Shleifer was caught diverting and hiding the assets for himself, using his wife’s firm. The largest private fund sponsoring the NBER program is LSV Asset Management, in control of $35 billion.… Around 2005 or 2006, sometime before the global offshore finance bubble blew out, Andrei Shleifer sold his share of LVS, [which stands for its founders, Lakonishok, Shleifer and Vishny], netting him perhaps around $400 million.202 Moreover, if we follow Assange’s assertion that there are only a few media organizations which can be considered trustworthy, we must assume that those are the ones which were selected by WikiLeaks to act as ‘partners’ in the release and editing of the leaks, including The New York Times, Der Spiegel The Guardian, El Paìs, [and] Le Monde.

Sanger, has proven more than once to be a propaganda tool for the US government, the most infamous example being the Iraqi WMD narrative promoted by Pulitzer Prize winner Judith Miller.” Would Assange be aware of this?” Of course he would. It is his organization in the first place, responsible for leaking the allegedly secret documents. In an interview, Assange indicates that WikiLeaks chose a variety of media to avoid the use of leaks for propaganda purposes. It is important to note that although these media might be owned by different groups and have different editorial policies, they are without exception news entities controlled by major Western media corporations. A much better way to avoid the use of leaks for disinformation purposes would have been to work with media from different regions of the world (e.g. Asia, Latin America, Middle East) as well as establish partnership agreements with the alternative media. By working primarily with media organizations from NATO countries [and belonging to Bilderberg’s inner circle], WikiLeaks has chosen to submit its leaks to one single ‘worldview’, that of the West.206 According to Lévesque “Young became very skeptical concerning the WikiLeaks project specifically with regard to the initial fund-raising goal of 5 million dollars, the contacts with elite organizations including Freedom House and the National Endowment for Democracy mentioned earlier”207 and the alleged millions of documents: [Young] “Announcing a $5 million fund-raising goal by July will kill this effort. It makes WL appear to be a Wall Street scam. This amount could not be needed so soon except for suspect purposes. I’d say the same about the alleged 1.1 million documents ready for leaking. Way too many to be believable without evidence. I don’t be- Young clarified his view on WikiLeaks in a written exchange with Evan James, fact-checker at Mother Jones magazine. “WikiLeaks set out to raise $5 million as soon as possible. That’s what remains its primary mission, as recently demonstrated and thus totally untrustworthy for information but fabulous entertainment in the leakage vein.”209 This individual further claims that “the lack of any significant high rollers backing Assange has led to a significant change of direction concerning fund raising. Keeping in mind that Assange has publicly stated that he needs $200, 000 just to keep the lights on, and $600, 000 to be fully funded; then just how much has Assange received, how much has been spent, and on what?

A pressing point when one considers WikiLeaks is still effectively closed down, and Assange, up until November 2010, continued to enjoy a particularly luxurious lifestyle, with no comparable income streams.”212 And, Young has gone even further. “[He] believes WikiLeaks is selling its secrets for commercial gain. Speaking to US talk radio, Young compared Julian Assange to Henry Kissinger, and other ‘spook insiders’ who have turned their insider knowledge into a lucrative sideline. ‘What has been released has been much less voluminous than the attention about them,’ said Young. ‘The goal is to exaggerate the importance of WikiLeaks’. From the earliest discussions, Young alleges, WikiLeaks intended to pimp out the information for funds. The original intention of WikiLeaks, see the emails, was to become wealthy doing what spies do using the twopronged practice of public service by secret means, ancient and corrupt. Negative criticism of this is water off the duck’s back. It is an obligation of spies and the wealthy to attack their kind, pretending opposition to cloak hand in hand.214 The free stuff is meant [to] lure volunteers and promote high-profile public service, lipsticked with risk, with the enterprise funded by selling costly material sold on the black market of worldwide spying in the tradition of public benefit ops, ID, spies and ever more spies. No better customers for illicit information that [sic] those with depthless pockets.215 There is a very large underground economy in stolen information. Some of it comes in using the Internet, other information comes from enlisted man in key positions, still other information comes directly from the government through agencies set up for this purpose and WikiLeaks is a part of that. It is a very small part, but the technology for selling stolen information is very large and very lucrative. Governments do it, operations do it and individuals do it. They basically sell stolen information. But, in order to sell it to the highest bidder, first you have to overvalue it, in order to get the highest price. So, WikiLeaks is engaged in a campaign to raise the price of their information.216 J. We are going to fuck them all. Chinese mostly, but not entirely a feint. Invention abounds.

Its consumers like it for that very reason. It rides the wave of imaginary disgust with MSM and governments, but it has not modified the formula of braggardy and drama essential to capture eyeballs and through eyeballs, minds and hearts.”219 It’s easy to perceive the connection between publication and the complaints people make about publication. But this generates a perception bias, because it overlooks the vastness of the invisible. It overlooks the unintended consequences of failing to publish and it overlooks all those who are emancipated by being in a climate where bad governance cannot be concealed. Such a climate is a motivating force to behave better in the first place and shifts structures and individuals that generate bad governance away from positions where they generate poor governance. Government has ample avenues to abuse revelation, not limited to the full force of intelligence, law enforcement, and complicit media. Moves towards the democratisation of revelation are strongly biased in favor of justice. Where democratised revelations are unjust they tend to affect isolated individuals, but where they are just, they affect systems of policy, planning an governance and through them the lives of all. WikiLeaks reveals, but it is not primarily a tool of revelation. There are many avenues on the internet for revelation.

Public scrutiny of otherwise unaccountable and secretive institutions pressures them to act ethically. What official will chance a secret, corrupt transaction when the public is likely to find out? What repressive plan will be carried out when it is revealed to the citizenry? When the risks of embarrassment through openness and honesty increase, the tables are turned against conspiracy, corruption, exploitation and oppression. Open government answers injustice rather than causing it. Open government exposes and undoes corruption. Open governance is the most cost effective method of promoting good governance. Instead of a couple of academic specialists, WL will provide a forum for the entire global community to examine any document relentlessly for credibility, plausibility, veracity and falsifiability. They will be able to interpret documents and explain their relevance to the public. If a document is leaked from the Chinese government, the entire Chinese dissident community can freely scrutinize and discuss it; if a document is leaked from Somalia, the entire Somali refugee community can analyze it and put it in context. And so on. WL may become the most powerful intelligence agency on earth, an intelligence agency of the people. It will be an open source, democratic intelligence agency. But it will be far better, far more principled, and far less parochial than any governmental intelligence agency; consequently, it will be more accurate, and more relevant. It will have no commercial or national interests at heart; its only interests will be truth and freedom of information. Unlike the covert activities of national intelligence agencies, WL will rely upon the power of overt fact to inform citizens about the truths of their world.

The LIMITED DISCLOSURE from the Wau Holland Foundation is no substitute for a fully audited disclosure of WIKILEAKS operating cash flows and current financial position. The Wau Holland Foundation is totally unaware of private or individual contributions to WIKILEAKS.

The one individual who has stealthily appeared throughout the pages of this chapter, a word here, a mention there, a link to him through one of the characters on the Board of Directors, then he is gone … only to reappear again a few lines later under a different guise is George Soros, who likes to sponsor ultra-left, subversive groups. In France, for example, the main left wing newspaper, Liberación, is owned by Baron Rothschild. Soros’ fingerprints are all over the WikiLeaks project. For example, not only has “Freedom House worked closely with Soros’ Open Society Institutes … in promoting such projects as the Washington-financed 2005 Tulip Revolution in Kyrgyzstan that brought the Washington-friendly dictator and drug boss, Kurmanbek Bakiyev to power,”223 but WikiLeaks Board member, Ben Laurie, a former security boss of Google is a director of Open Rights Group, funded by Soros’ front group, the Open Society Foundation.

To most people, George Soros is a philanthropist, a man who donates hundreds of millions of dollars to build a better world. A man of peace and a man of freedom. A savvy investor and a businessman with a Midas touch. However, a picture of the real Soros is something quite different. He is, or rather his group of foundations is, a front for the left-wing Anglo-American intelligence community on the one hand and the U.S. government’s “Project Democracy” side on the other. To understand how Soros is involved in WikiLeaks’ disinformation campaign, it is imperative to know who George Soros is and where he comes from. “Soros is no newcomer to the world of criminal activity. He was handed his startup money by Baron Edmond de Rothschild’s right-hand man, George Karlweiss, who also launched the career of fugitive narcotics trafficker, Robert Vesco. Since then, Soros has been involved in various vicious operations such as financial speculative warfare to destroy national currencies, pushing murderous ‘useless eater’ euthanasia polices, and massively financing international campaigns for the legal- On November 30, 1994, Soros spoke before an audience at the Columbia Presbyterian Medical Centre, and announced his new foundation, Project on Death in America, to shift the training of hospitals, nurses and doctors away from expensive life-saving treatment, to the proper care of the dying.… A Soros sponsored assisted suicide program to offer patients lethal prescriptions was the Oregon Death with Dignity Act. Soros’ promotion of narco-terrorism is the equivalent of the “gunboats” employed by the Empire in its launching of the $1 9 ^ { } $ Century Opium Wars against China and India. One of the leading drug traffickers of the British Empire wrote that as long as drug use continues to dominate", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:WL0003SearchInside_cleaned.txt:51:0cf992040baf", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 6556, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "WL0003SearchInside_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/Deconstructing-Wikileaks-Daniel-Estulin/dp/1937584119", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "WL0003SearchInside_cleaned", "chunk_index": 52, "text": "expensive life-saving treatment, to the proper care of the dying.… A Soros sponsored assisted suicide program to offer patients lethal prescriptions was the Oregon Death with Dignity Act.

One of the leading drug traffickers of the British Empire wrote that as long as drug use continues to dominate the country, “there is not the least reason to fear that she will become a military power of any importance, as the habit saps the energies and the vitality of the nation.… According to the American Almanac, the bankers are part of a network called the “Club of the Isles” which is an informal association of European royalty including Queen Elizabeth. The Club of the Isles commands an estimated $10 trillion in assets. It lords over such corporate giants as Royal Dutch Shell, Imperial Chemical Industries, Lloyds of London, Unilever, Lonrho, Rio Tinto Zinc, and Anglo American DeBeers. It dominates the world supply of petroleum, gold, diamonds, and many other vital raw materials; and deploys these assets not merely in the pursuit of its geopolitical agenda. Rather than use the powers of the state to achieve their geopolitical goals, a secret cross-linked holding of private financial interests, tied to the old aristocratic oligarchy of Western Europe, was developed. It was in many ways modeled on the 17th-century British and Dutch East India Companies. The heart of this Club of the Isles is the financial center of the old British Empire, the City of London. Soros is one of what in medieval days were called The most important of such ‘Jews who are not Jews,’ are the Rothschilds, who launched Soros’ career. They are members of the Club of the Isles and retainers of the British royal family. This has been true since Amschel Rothschild sold the British Hessian troops to fight against George Washington during the American Revolution. “Soros is American only in his passport. He is a global financial operator, who happens to be in New York, simply because ‘that’s where the money is,’ as the bank robber Willy Sutton once quipped, when asked why he always robbed banks. Soros speculates in world financial markets through his offshore company, Quantum Fund NV, a private investment fund, or “hedge fund.” His hedge fund reportedly manages some $11 − 14 billion of funds on behalf of its clients, or investors—one of the most prominent of whom is, according to Soros, Britain’s Queen Elizabeth, the wealthiest person in Europe.… Quantum Fund refers to the indeterminacy principle of Werner Heisenberg: the impossibility of simultaneously measuring the position and velocity of an atomic particle. Applied to the markets, the idea is that can not be reversed without affecting its prospects, for better or for", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:WL0003SearchInside_cleaned.txt:52:80a29130c46a", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 6557, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "WL0003SearchInside_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/Deconstructing-Wikileaks-Daniel-Estulin/dp/1937584119", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "WL0003SearchInside_cleaned", "chunk_index": 53, "text": "His hedge fund reportedly manages some $11 − 14 billion of funds on behalf of its clients, or investors—one of the most prominent of whom is, according to Soros, Britain’s Queen Elizabeth, the wealthiest person in Europe.… Quantum Fund refers to the indeterminacy principle of Werner Heisenberg: the impossibility of simultaneously measuring the position and velocity of an atomic particle. Applied to the markets, the idea is that can not be reversed without affecting its prospects, for better or for worse. Soros option was both an ironic wink and a homage to the notions of fallibility, reflexivity and his own convention of incomplete determinism. The Quantum Fund is registered in the tax haven of the Netherlands Antilles, in the Caribbean. This is to avoid paying taxes, as well as to hide the true nature of his investors and what he does with their money. In order to avoid U.S. government supervision of his financial activities, something normal U.S.-based investment funds must by law agree to in order to operate, Soros moved his legal headquarters to the Caribbean tax haven of Curacao. The Netherlands Antilles has repeatedly been cited by the Task Force on Money Laundering of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) as one of the world’s most important centers for laundering illegal proceeds of the Latin American George Soros is part of a tightly knit financial mafia—‘mafia,’ in the sense of a closed masonic-like fraternity of families pursuing common aims. Anyone who dares to criticize Soros or any of his associates, is immediately hit with the charge of being ‘anti-Semitic’—-a criticism which often silences or intimidates genuine critics of Soros’ unscrupulous operations. The Anti-Defamation League of B’nai B’rith considers it a top priority to “protect” Soros from the charges of ‘anti-Semites’ in Hungary and elsewhere in Central Europe, according to ADL National Director Abraham Foxman. The ADL’s record of service to the British oligarchy has been amply documented by EIR.227 For a long time, the Anti-Defamation League was led by David Bialkin of the law firm Wilkie, Farr and Gallagher. “The ADL is a British intelligence operation founded in the United States by the British MI6 and controlled by Saul Steinberg and Eric Trist of Tavistock Institute. Saul Steinberg is the U.S. representative and partner to the Jacob de Rothschild family of London.”228 “Soros’ relation to the Rothschild finance circle represents no ordinary or casual banking connection. It goes a long way to explain the extraordinary success of a mere private speculator, and Soros’ uncanny ability to ‘gamble right’ so many times in such high-risk markets. Soros has access to the ‘insider track’ in some of the most important government and private channels in the world.…”229 3 Michel Chossudovsky, “Who is behind WikiLeaks,” globalresearch.ca, December, 13, 2001 http://www.globalresearch.ca/index.php?context ≡ va&aid = 22389 . 4 Adam K.

Engdahl, “The Secret Financial Network Behind “Wizard” George Soros,” EIR, November 1, 1996. “W ikiLeaks is upheld as a breakthrough in thebattle against media disinformation and the lies of the US government; an immeasurable victory against corporate media censorship.”1 According to the Guardian, “US authorities have known for weeks that they have suffered a hemorrhage of secret information on a scale which makes even the leaking of the Pentagon Papers during the Vietnam war look limited by comparison.” 2 In July 2010, WikiLeaks released between 75,000 and 90,000 pages of documents that “exhaustively chronicle the twists, turns and horror of the 9-year-old war in Afghanistan.”3 Unquestionably, the released documents have provoked unparalleled global interest as well as an important and valuable data bank. The documents provide “a useful window into the manner in which the … international financial oligarchy operates. The oligarchy [in question], is essentially a private criminal enterprise, which stretches across the globe, operating through a network of government agencies, private institutions, and both publicly owned and private corporations. Some of these relationships are out in the open, while others are hidden.… The … historic role in the Asian opium trade is a good example of how the oligarchy functions.”4 We will be examining it in this chapter. the troubled nine-year conflict. “Tens of thousands of pages of reports document attacks on U.S. troops and their responses, relations between Americans in the field and their Afghan allies, intramural squabbles among Afghan civilians and security forces, and concerns about neighboring Pakistan’s ties to the Taliban.”5 However, there are several things that need to be kept in mind. Because these are not paper documents but digital files, we can’t know for sure if they are authentic. There are three versions in major newspapers, all digital, which are notoriously easy to doctor. And apparently, according to insiders, the files are made in the field on computers and sent in to headquarters. So, when we are told, “this the biggest dump of military documents,” that is not totally honest because these are not actual paper documents. Plus many intelligence agencies are also dumping huge amounts of files onto the Internet. Cryptome is a “repository for information about freedom of speech, cryptography, spying, and surveillance.”6 Cryptome’s founder is an independent scholar and architect John Young. According to Young, “when studying the WikiLeaks War Logs, bear in mind that intelligence streams – hardcopy, digital, electromagnetic – are salted with spurious entries as markers to authenticate the stream, identify disruptions and unauthorised plants,", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:WL0003SearchInside_cleaned.txt:60:e027f536843b", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 6565, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "WL0003SearchInside_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/Deconstructing-Wikileaks-Daniel-Estulin/dp/1937584119", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "WL0003SearchInside_cleaned", "chunk_index": 61, "text": "these are not actual paper documents.

Cryptome is a “repository for information about freedom of speech, cryptography, spying, and surveillance.”6 Cryptome’s founder is an independent scholar and architect John Young. According to Young, “when studying the WikiLeaks War Logs, bear in mind that intelligence streams – hardcopy, digital, electromagnetic – are salted with spurious entries as markers to authenticate the stream, identify disruptions and unauthorised plants, direct the product to various collectors with varying levels of classification, and more. The spurious entries will not be distinguishable from the other material, it is their positions in the stream, or omissions from the stream, which will be part of authentication. None of this requires or is protected by encryption, indeed, encryption is customarily used to mislead about other means and methods – which is why it is so loudly touted. Some streams are entirely spurious but composed of authentic material, to cloud the process, to entrap, to delude, to fake a vulnerability. These methods are well known to the ‘techheads’ of WikiLeaks although they may lack required programs and equipment to analyze streams in all their guises. WikiLeaks claims to cloud its transmissions for protection, a perfect marker for others. Three versions of the Afghan War logs were given to the dupes, another to the public. Another for WikiLeaks alone, more or less.7 Let’s move to the documents themselves. The 90,000 lowlevel intelligence interoffice, routine documents, obtained by WikiLeaks and made available to a number of mainstream news organizations, focus their coverage on two things: Pakistan is treacherous and Pakistan betrayed the United States. “Reports of this nature serve to provide legitimacy to US drone attacks against alleged terrorist targets inside Pakistan,”8 and the demonization of Pakistani intelligence service, ISI. Furthermore, “the corporate media’s use and interpretation of the WikiLeaks cables serves to uphold two related myths: 1) Iran has nuclear weapons program and constitutes a threat to global security. 2) Saudi Arabia and Pakistan are state sponsors of several Islamic terrorist organizations, a fact that is known to all informed observers and amply documented. They are financing Islamic terrorist organizations, which are intent upon attacking the US and its NATO allies.”9 that the world has not yet found an acceptable definition of ‘terrorism.’ One country’s terrorist is too often another’s freedom fighter. At the heart of the matter lies the world’s deep-seated ambivalence towards violence. Once violence is accepted as a legitimate political instrument, then the morality and political acceptability of terrorists (insurgents or freedom fighters) becomes contentious, bumpy terrain. The U.S. government itself has funded, armed, and sheltered plenty of rebels and insurgents around the world. The CIA and Pakistan’s Inter-Services Intelligence agency trained and armed the mujahideen who, in the 1980s, were seen as terrorists by the government in Soviet-occupied Afghanistan. “While President Reagan posed", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:WL0003SearchInside_cleaned.txt:61:34eb4f7614f6", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 6566, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "WL0003SearchInside_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/Deconstructing-Wikileaks-Daniel-Estulin/dp/1937584119", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "WL0003SearchInside_cleaned", "chunk_index": 62, "text": "matter lies the world’s deep-seated ambivalence towards violence.

Today, Pakistan – America’s ally in this new war – sponsors insurgents who cross the border into Kashmir in India. Pakistan lauds them as ‘freedom fighters,’ India calls them ’terrorists.’ India, for its part, denounces countries who sponsor and abet terrorism, but the Indian army has, in the past, trained separatist Tamil rebels (LTTE) asking for a homeland in Sri Lanka, who are responsible for countless acts of bloody terrorism. (Just as the CIA abandoned the mujahideen after they had served its purpose, India abruptly turned its back on the Tamil rebels for a host of political reasons. It was an enraged LTTE suicide-bomber who assassinated former Indian prime minister Rajiv Gandhi in 1991.)”10 Economist Michel Chossudovsky raises some interesting issues when he writes that the use of the WikiLeaks documents by the media “sustains the illusion that the CIA has nothing to do with the terror network and that Saudi Arabia and the Gulf states are ‘providing the lion’s share of funding’ to al Qaeda, the Taliban, Lashkar-e-Taiba, among others, when in fact this financing is undertaken in liaison and consultation with their US intelligence counterparts.” 11 This, it should be understood, is “war on terror” propaganda. The real story is quite different. “Largely as a result of the Bush administration’s ‘war on terror,’” write Elizabeth Gould & Paul Fitzgerald, “the traditional framework of the East-West political dialogue has broken and fallen entirely under the spell of the extremists on both sides. Since much of the West’s relationship was based on Cold War and Neocolonial relationships to begin with it shouldn’t come as a surprise that it finally broke. Yet nothing new and as powerful has come along to replace it. Now what we see is confusion in the West as declining powers like the U.S. attempt to rig the international system to ensure some role in a future where they cannot control events as they had. The U.S. failure in Afghanistan is largely due to an inability to switch its thinking from the Cold War to a multi-polar world while it had the authority and power to do so. Instead, as the result of manipulation by right wing and neo-conservative intellectuals, the U.S. simply substituted Islam for communism and went on with an aggressive strategy as before.”12 In regards to Pakistan, while", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:WL0003SearchInside_cleaned.txt:62:3b5dc1729756", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 6567, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "WL0003SearchInside_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/Deconstructing-Wikileaks-Daniel-Estulin/dp/1937584119", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "WL0003SearchInside_cleaned", "chunk_index": 63, "text": "ensure some role in a future where they cannot control events as they had.

Thus, we must examine the situation presently and so historically. WikiLeaks revealed, that Arab Gulf states help fund the Taliban in Afghanistan, so the common claim that it is Pakistan ‘alone’ is immediately made to be erroneous. Is it possible that Pakistan is still working with the Taliban? Of course. They have historically through their intelligence services, the ISI, and while they have never done it without U.S. support (mostly through the CIA), the ISI still receives most of its outside funding from the CIA. The CIA funding of the ISI, a reality since the late 70s, picked up dramatically following 9/11, the operations of which the ISI has been itself complicit in financing. Thus, The trouble with discounting information that does not fit in with your previously conceived ideas is that it does not allow for evolution or progress in thinking. This should never be done in regards to any subject, yet it is commonly done for all subjects, by official and critical voices alike. With Pakistan, we must understand that while historically it has been a staunch U.S. ally in the region, propping up every government, supporting every coup, American geopolitical ambitions have changed as a result of the changing geopolitical reality of the world. Pakistan has drawn increasingly close to China, which built a major seaport on Pakistan’s coast, giving China access to the Indian Ocean. This is a strategic threat to India and the United States more broadly, which seeks to subdue and control China’s growing influence (while simultaneously attempting to engage in efforts of international integration with China, specifically economically). India and Pakistan are historical enemies, and wars have been fought between them before. India and America are in a strategic alliance, and America helped India with its nuclear program, much to the distaste of the Pakistanis, who drew closer to China. Pakistan occupies an area of the utmost strategic importance: with its neighbors being Afghanistan, China, India and Iran.13 In her Outlook article, “War is Peace,” Arundhati Roy follows up: “It is", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:WL0003SearchInside_cleaned.txt:63:ac3ffe5a9661", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 6568, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "WL0003SearchInside_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/Deconstructing-Wikileaks-Daniel-Estulin/dp/1937584119", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "WL0003SearchInside_cleaned", "chunk_index": 64, "text": "of international integration with China, specifically economically).

Igniting and exploiting religious sentiments for reasons of political expediency is the most dangerous legacy that governments or politicians can bequeath to any people – including their own. People who live in societies ravaged by religious or communal bigotry know that every religious text – from the Bible to the Bhagwad Gita – can be mined and misinterpreted to justify anything, from nuclear war to genocide to corporate globalization.”14 But this is just the tip of the iceberg. There also seems to be a great deal of whitewashing of valuable information that doesn’t fit into a pre-determined mold, set up by the mainstream press. As Andrew Gavin Marshall writes at globalresearch.ca: “The ‘revelations’ however, are not simply challenging American perceptions of America, but of all nations and their populations.”15 And to the would-be-Masters of the Universe, this lack of control is unnerving. “This is likely why the corporate media is so heavily involved in the dissemination of this information.”16 In other words, they are heavily involved in the interpretation of the message. For example, historical and cultural differences between ethnic groups are simply chalked up to local al-Qaeda cells, if we are to believe WikiLeaks. A key area that offers misleading interpretation in the mainstream press is the Balochistan street violence supposedly orchestrated by local terrorist elements with close links to al-Qaeda. However, to understand the massacres of Shiites in Karbala, Baghdad and in Pakistan’s Balochistan province of Quetta during the procession of Muhurrum on March 2, 2004 and its implications in the War on Terror today, we must go back to the creation of Pakistan in 1947. B. Raman, writing for Kashmir Telegraph, explains that when Pakistan was founded that year: … the Shia [Shiites] were amongst the major land-owners of Pakistan’s Punjab, its granary, and many of the Sunnis, who migrated to Pakistan from India’s Punjab, were largely poor landless farm workers, who had to earn their livelihood in their country of adoption by working in the farms of the Shias…. Clearly the exploitation of Sunnis by Shiite landowners triggered the polarization between the two Islamic sects in Pakistan. The race to sectarian rivalry began when Shiite elements founded Tehrik Nifaz-i-Fiqah-i-Jafri (TNFJ, meaning the Movement for the", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:WL0003SearchInside_cleaned.txt:64:08c13ba873f8", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 6569, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "WL0003SearchInside_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/Deconstructing-Wikileaks-Daniel-Estulin/dp/1937584119", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "WL0003SearchInside_cleaned", "chunk_index": 65, "text": "major land-owners of Pakistan’s Punjab, its granary, and many of the Sunnis, who migrated to Pakistan from India’s Punjab, were largely poor landless farm workers, who had to earn their livelihood in their country of adoption by working in the farms of the Shias….

The race to sectarian rivalry began when Shiite elements founded Tehrik Nifaz-i-Fiqah-i-Jafri (TNFJ, meaning the Movement for the Implementation of Fiqah-i-Jafri, Shia school of Islamic jurisprudence, which later became known as the Tehrik-e-Jaffri Pakistan). In response to this attempt of a minority to impose their ideas on the majority, Maulana Haq Nawaz Jhangvi, a Deobandi cleric (a sub-sect within Sunni) founded in Jhang, a Punjab district of Pakistan, a Sunni extremist organization called Anjuman Sipah-i-Sahaba Pakistan (ASSP), which later was renamed Sipah-e-Sahaba Pakistan (SSP). This organization became a political organization that apparently also has a terrorist wing, while its offshoot, the Lashkar-e-Jhangvi (LEJ), is a hardened terrorist group. With the blessing of Zia-ul-Haq, Pakistan’s military dictator in the 1980s, the SSP questioned women’s right to lead the country and spread the message that the Shiites and Nusrat Bhutto, Benazir’s mother, were Iran’s subordinates. Furthermore, the SSP demanded that the Shiites be denied Muslim identity while politically pushing the agenda of turning Pakistan into a Sunni state. SSP’s virulently anti-Shiite ideology was also exploited by Iraq and U.S. intelligence agencies in their attempts to destabilize Iran and create the conditions to overthrow Shiite clerics in power in Tehran. As a result of support from Saddam Hussein in the 90s, SSP, a Pakistani anti-Shia movement and not anti-Iranian, began to harass Iranians who lived and visited Pakistan. Many known Pakistani and Arab terrorists began their careers as members of the SSP network and took part in the massacres of Shiites in Pakistan, Iran and Afghanistan. One of them for example, is Ramzi Yousef, the mastermind of the attack on the Twin Towers in 1993. Another was Maulana Masood Azhar of Jaish-e-Mohammad (JEM), a religious leader who supports Muslim separatists fighting in the conflict zone of Kashmir, or Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, a Jordanian accused of being the mastermind behind a string of spectacular suicide bombings in Iraq. Along with other Jordanians, most of Chechen blood, Al-Zarqawi came to Pakistan in the 1980s to join the Arab mercenary force trained and supplied by the CIA and Pakistani intelligence service (ISI) to be used against Soviet troops in Afghanistan.17 Consequently, during the 1980s, a sophisticated network between Afghan mujahideen, and religious groups from Pakistan was launched. This network was equipped with a generous supply of arms from the US, the UK, Israel and South Africa. The mix of easy access to weapons with an increasingly motivated group of terrorists meant a rapid spread of violence from Afghanistan to Pakistan itself.

This network was equipped with a generous supply of arms from the US, the UK, Israel and South Africa. The mix of easy access to weapons with an increasingly motivated group of terrorists meant a rapid spread of violence from Afghanistan to Pakistan itself. The growing extremism among rival militant groups increased tensions due to the widespread western support of Afghan groups fighting the Soviets and then to the support of specific groups of hard-line Islamists, after the Soviet withdrawal turned into full-blown carnage. First a “civil war” between the mujahideen fighters themselves, then later war against the CIA and the United States government. Raman continues, “Zarqawi, along with the late Riaz Basra, the leader of the Lashkar-e-Jhangvi (LEJ), the militant wing of the SSP, helped the Taliban in the capture of Kabul in September, 1996…. Osama bin Laden never liked Saddam, whom he looked upon as an apostate because of his secular and socialist policies, and the proximity of the LEJ and al-Zarqawi to Saddam’s intelligence agency created differences between them and bin Laden.”18 Up until 2002, LEJ’s activities against Shiites focused only in the Punjab and Sindh. The province of Balochistan, which covers a huge area in southwestern Pakistan, bordering Afghanistan and Iran remained fairly free of anti-Shia sentiment. That changed with the arrest by Pakistani authorities in March 2003 of Khalid Sheikh Mohammad (KSM), allegedly one of the 9/11 conspirators and his subsequent hand-over to the FBI. It was rumored that KSM had fled to Quetta from Karachi in September 2002 after the arrest of Ramzi Binalshibh, another of the alleged 9/11 masterminds. Binalshibh had traveled from Quetta to Rawalpindi fearful of being betrayed by the Balochistani Hazars, a group that allegedly collaborated with the CIA in the search for bin Laden in retaliation for the slaugh- ter of Hazars in Afghanistan before 9/11. The Hazars are Shiite Muslims and therefore enemies of the Taliban, who are Sunni Muslim radicals. The slaughter of the Shiites in Quetta on March 2, in turn, was retaliation for their alleged collaboration with the Americans in a search for bin Laden and in part was directed against then President Pervez Musharraf, in order to convince him to soften his measures against the Islamic extremist groups as well as to undermine support for the U.S. Even before the Iraq invasion, bin Laden’s terrorist elements began assembling there from Saudi Arabia and Iran in order to launch a jihad against the Americans. The first group to arrive was the Harkat-ul-Mujahideen (HUM), a terrorist organization very active in Jammu and Kashmir (JYC) and whose center of operations is located in Muzaffarabad, the part of Kashmir occupied by Pakistan, whose sole purpose", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:WL0003SearchInside_cleaned.txt:66:34d90f8f7ddc", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 6571, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "WL0003SearchInside_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/Deconstructing-Wikileaks-Daniel-Estulin/dp/1937584119", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "WL0003SearchInside_cleaned", "chunk_index": 67, "text": "his measures against the Islamic extremist groups as well as to undermine support for the U.S. Even before the Iraq invasion, bin Laden’s terrorist elements began assembling there from Saudi Arabia and Iran in order to launch a jihad against the Americans.

They went as Haj pilgrims to Mecca and from there moved to Iraq. Then, the LEJ, along with Arabic-speaking volunteers of the Lashkar-e-Taiba (LET), the armed wing of the religious organization based in Pakistan, Markaz-ud-Dawawal-Irshad (MDI) – a Sunni missionary anti-American organization founded in 1989 – also began going clandestinely into Iraq. They, in turn, were followed by a large contingent of Jordanian and Saudi Arabs of Chechen origin from South Waziristan, Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA). These tribal areas, or agencies, as they are sometimes called, were created by the British to serve as a buffer zone between India and Afghanistan. “Of those who went to Iraq from Pakistan, only members of the LEJ had previously participated in the massacres of Shiites in Pakistan and Afghanistan and it was expected to participate willingly in similar massacres in Iraq. It is unlikely that the Iraqi resistance was involved in massacres like those carried out in Karbala and Baghdad. According to India’s intelligence services, all point to LEJ as a leading suspect. Their position of targeting Shiites in Iraq is due in part to their deep hatred of the Shiites and partly in retaliation for the alleged collaboration of Shiite leaders in Iraq with American troops. Thus, if Iran wanted to provoke clashes between Shiites and Sunnis, with the aim of inciting a civil war in Iraq, as reported by the United States, they would use LEJ, with whom they have had a long history of collaboration and who would not hesitate to kill Shiites, as an ideal execution arm.”19 he released WikiLeaks cables are also being used to create divisions between Iran, viewed as a threat to global security by the State Department, Saudi Arabia and the Gulf States: “After WikiLeaks claimed that certain Arab states are concerned about Iran’s nuclear program and have urged the U.S. to take [military] action to contain Iran, U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton took advantage of the issue and said that the released cables showed U.S. concerns regarding Iran’s nuclear program are shared by the international community.”20 It should come as no surprise that the New York Times, partners in the WikiLeaks project, “steps center stage in its unbridled contempt for truth and relentless use of propaganda to serve U.S. imperial interests,”21 The Times was used to redact and filter the documents, by", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:WL0003SearchInside_cleaned.txt:67:fc4ba5e44fef", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 6572, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "WL0003SearchInside_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/Deconstructing-Wikileaks-Daniel-Estulin/dp/1937584119", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "WL0003SearchInside_cleaned", "chunk_index": 68, "text": "action to contain Iran, U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton took advantage of the issue and said that the released cables showed U.S. concerns regarding Iran’s nuclear program are shared by the international community.”20 It should come as no surprise that the New York Times, partners in the WikiLeaks project, “steps center stage in its unbridled contempt for truth and relentless use of propaganda to serve U.S. imperial interests,”21 The Times was used to redact and filter the documents, by centring their attention on a highly “selective” dissemination of the WikiLeaks cables. Michel Chossudovsky of globalresearch.ca explains: “Focussing on areas which would justify a US foreign policy agenda: Iran’s alleged nuclear weapons program, North Korea, Saudi Arabia and Pakistan’s support of Islamic terrorism, China’s relations with North Korea, etc. These releases were then used as source material in NYT articles and commentary” 22 by David E. Sanger and his colleagues “to feed the disinformation campaign.”23 [W]e went through [the cables] so carefully to try to redact material that we thought could be damaging to individuals or undercut ongoing operations. And we even took the very unusual step of showing the 100 cables or so that we were writing from to the U.S. government and asking them if they had additional redactions to suggest.24 Who exactly is David E. Sanger? For starters, he is a member of the Council on Foreign Relations (CFR) and the Aspen Institute’s Strategy Group25 which includes the likes of David Rockefeller, former Vice President of the United States Dick Cheney, former CIA head John Deutch, the president of the World Bank, Robert B. Zoellick and Henry Kissinger, not to mention every president of the United States except George W. Bush and every director of the Central Intelligence Agency. The WikiLeaks documents focus on how Iran was fomenting a number of insurgencies in Afghanistan along their border. Fox News ran an article proclaiming that, “Leaked Documents Show Middle East Consensus on Threat Posed by Iran,” and commented that, “the seismic document spill by WikiLeaks showed one area of profound agreement – that Iran is viewed in the Middle East as the region’s No. 1 troublemaker.”26 We are left with the meme that we should de-emphasize and downplay the Afghan war and look at our real enemies in the area, the two big states, which are Iran and Pakistan. One of the obvious methods, is to play one off against the other and this is the pattern we are seeing. The US strategy in the entire Middle East is to line up a group of states, which will be Arab and Sunni, against Iran, which is Shi’a. Middle Eastern states like Saudi Arabia and United Arab Emirates are egged on by the United States to attack Iran, because it threatens them. That too, must be understood in terms of local and regional conflicts as described earlier.

That too, must be understood in terms of local and regional conflicts as described earlier. In his well researched article “WikiLeaks and the Worldwide Information War,” Andrew Gavin Marshall argues that on the one hand, geopolitical alliances and the seeking of favors from the United States have more to do with regionwide condemnation of Iran than anything else. And on the other hand, the leaks are being used to justify a foreign policy agenda: Iran is Saudi Arabia’s primary contender and competition for power and influence in the region, and thus Iran is, inherently, a threat to Saudi Arabia, politically. Further, the Arab states, whose claims against Iran have been widely publicized, such as those of Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Oman, the UAE and Egypt, must be understood in their relation to the United States. The Arab states are American proxies in the region. Their armies are subsidized by the American military industrial complex, their political regimes (all of which are dictatorships and dynasties), are propped up and supported by America. The same goes for Israel, although it has at least the public outward appearance of a democracy, much like the United States, itself. The Arab nations and leaders know that the only reason they have and maintain their power is because the United States allows them and helps them to do so. Thus, they are dependent upon America and its political, financial and military support. Going against America’s ambitions in the region is a sure way to end up like Iraq and Saddam Hussein. The history of the Middle East in the modern era is replete with examples of how one-time puppets and personal favorites of the American Empire can so easily turn into new enemies and ‘threats to peace.’ American sponsored regime change takes place, and a new puppet is installed. If Arab leaders said that Iran was not a threat to peace, they would soon find themselves targets of Western imperialism.27 None of these candid analyses or critiques comes through in any of the embassy cables touted by WikiLeaks as the motherload of truth. “Craig Murray was a former British Ambassador to Uzbekistan who made a name for himself in exposing intelligence from Uzbekistan related to al-Qaeda as entirely unreliable, due to the methods of torture used to get the information (such as boiling people alive).

This intelligence was passed to the CIA and MI6, which Murray said was ‘factually incorrect.’ When Murray expressed his concerns with the higher-ups in the British diplomatic services, he was reprimanded for talking about ‘human rights.’ In the midst of the latest WikiLeaks releases of diplomatic documents, Craig Murray was asked to write an article for the Guardian regarding his interpretation of the issue. As Murray later noted, the paper placed his article, largely reduced, hidden in the middle of a long article which was a compendium of various commentaries on WikiLeaks… In the article, Murray begins by assessing the claims of government officials around the world, particularly in the United States, that WikiLeaks exposes the United States to ‘harm,’ that it puts lives at risk, and that they will ‘encourage Islamic extremism,’ and most especially, the notion that ‘government secrecy is essential to keep us all safe.’ Murray explains that having been a diplomat for over 20 years, he is very familiar with these arguments, particularly that as a result of WikiLeaks, diplomats will no longer be candid in giving advice, ‘if that advice might become public.…’ Murray pointedly asked why a type of behavior that is considered reprehensible for most people – such as lying – ‘should be considered acceptable, or even praiseworthy, in diplomacy.’ Murray explained that for British diplomats, ‘this belief that their profession exempts them from the normal constraints of decent behavior amounts to a cult of Machiavellianism, a pride in their own amorality.’ He explained that diplomats come from a very narrow upper social strata, and ‘view themselves as ultra-intelligent Nietzschean supermen, above normal morality’ who are socially connected to the political elite. In criticizing the claims made by many commentators that the release of the leaks endanger lives, Murray pointedly wrote that this perspective needs to be ‘set against any such risk the hundreds of thousands of actual dead from the foreign policies of the US and its co-conspirators in the past decade.’28 The prejudice against Iran is obvious when the mainthat Iran constitutes a threat, while promulgating its own lies and fabrications concerning Iran’s supposed nuclear weapons program on the other. “The leaks, once they are funneled into the corporate news chain, edited and redacted by the New York Times, indelibly serve the broader interests of US foreign policy, including US-NATO-Israel war preparations directed against Iran.”29 For example, “what are the odds that the first 1,270 cables out of some 251,000 that the New York Times, the Guardian and Der Spiegel published were all in sync with US-UK-Germany-Nato policy outlook?

He then proceeds to answer the question himself. “This is a propaganda war, not a war for truth, at least not if you go by the initial manipulated stories released by the three news publications.”31 The manipulation doesn’t stop. Chossudovsky unmasks some of the leading players. “With regard to ‘leaked intelligence’ and the coverage of Iran’s alleged nuclear weapons program, David E. Sanger has played a crucial role. In November 2005, The New York Times published a report coauthored by David E. Sanger and William J. Broad entitled “Relying on Computer, U.S. Seeks to Prove Iran’s Nuclear Aims.” These ‘secret documents’ were “subsequently submitted by the US State Department to the International Atomic Energy Agency IAEA, with a view to demonstrating that Iran was developing a nuclear weapons program. They were also used as a pretext to enforce the economic sanctions regime directed against Iran, adopted by the UN Security Council.32 The whole thing blew up in America’s face when an article by investigative reporter Gareth Porter confirmed that the mysterious laptop documents are fake.33 “The drawings contained in the documents leaked by William J. Broad and David E. Sanger pertain to an obsolete North Korean missile system which was decommissioned by Iran in the mid-1990s.”34 Moreover, in a bitter irony, the selective redacting of the WikiLeaks embassy cables by the New York Times has usefully served not only to dismiss the central issue of fake intelligence but also to reinforce, through media disinformation, Washington’s claim that Iran is developing nuclear weapons. A case in point is a November 2010 [New York Times] article co-authored by David E. Sanger, which quotes the WikiLeaks cables” as a source: ‘Iran obtained 19 of the missiles from North Korea, according to a [WikiLeaks] cable dated Feb. 24 of this year.…35 Thus, WikiLeaks and Julian Assange fulfill the conditions for a limited-hang-out operation by the intelligence agencies themselves, if we include things like Project Democracy on the U.S. side, Soros, the group of foundations which is a part of the intelligence community and a well orchestrated media disinformation campaign aimed at demonizing a powerful regional enemy, Iran.

There is another way in which intelligence agencies to cover up blatant usurpation of power. “For example, within the WikiLeaks cables, take the British Prince Andrew, Queen Elizabeth’s second son, who has been subject to many cable ‘revelations.’ The U.S. Ambassador to Kyrgyzstan” wrote a cable regarding a meeting she attended with … Prince Andrew, who is a special U.K. trade representative…. At the meeting, Prince Andrew ranted against ‘those [expletive] journalists … who poke their noses everywhere,’ and he ‘railed at British anticorruption investigators, who had the idiocy of almost scuttling the al-Yamamah deal with Saudi Arabia,’ particularly ‘referencing an investigation, subsequently closed, into alleged kickbacks a senior Saudi royal had received in exchange for the multi-year, lucrative BAE Systems contract to provide equipment and training to Saudi security forces.’ When he ranted against the me- dia – specifically the Guardian paper – for making it harder to do business abroad, the U.S. Ambassador noted that the businessmen in attendance ‘roared their approval’ and ‘practically clapped.’ Again, evidence for how elites despise true representations of democracy and freedom.”36 There is a more sinister side to this, which intelligence professionals recognize as bait-and-switch trick. Accordingly, “Andrew Feinstein, an anti-corruption campaigner and former South African MP who resigned in protest over BAE bribery allegations, said: ‘I am amazed but not entirely surprised by the prince’s comments. The royal family has actively supported Britain’s arms sales, even when corruption and malfeasance has been suspected.’”37 [emphasis added] Furthermore, the Guardian would know about the al-Yamamah deal with Saudi Arabia, as they were involved in a decade-long probe “along with the BBC, and the British Serious Fraud Office (SFO), into the al-Yamamah arms contract, a nearly $80 billion, 22-year long deal between BAE Systems and the Saudi government, in which British-made fighter jets and support services were provided to the Saudi Kingdom, beginning in 1985′ in return for Saudi delivery of oil to Britain. The deal included an “estimated $2 billion in cumulative payoffs to Prince Bandar,” for his role in brokering the al-Yamamah deal. Bandar was the Saudi’s “de facto chief diplomat to Britain, the Soviet Union, and China, as well as the U.S.A.,” 38 As Jeffrey Steinberg revealed in the pages of Executive Intelligence Review, “every British government, from Margaret Thatcher, through John Major, to Tony Blair, has been thoroughly implicated in the BAE-Saudi scandal.”39 In the intelligence world, this is the ‘bait’ part of", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:WL0003SearchInside_cleaned.txt:72:fd3c474e1737", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 6577, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "WL0003SearchInside_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/Deconstructing-Wikileaks-Daniel-Estulin/dp/1937584119", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "WL0003SearchInside_cleaned", "chunk_index": 73, "text": "an “estimated $2 billion in cumulative payoffs to Prince Bandar,” for his role in brokering the al-Yamamah deal.

In other words, people are generally familiar with certain details of the deal as per the mainstream press revelations. An oil tanker holds approximately 600,000 barrels of oil. BAE Systems began ‘official’ delivery of the Tornado and Hawk planes to Saudi Arabia in 1989.… EIR economist John Hoefle … concluded that the total value of the oil sales, based on the value of the dollar at the time of delivery, was $125 billion. Based on the best available public records, the total sticker price on the military equipment and services provided by BAE Systems to Saudi Arabia, over the 22-year period to date, was approximately $80 billion. And those figures are inflated by billions of dollars in slush fund payouts. Indeed, the latest limited-damage scandal around al-Yamamah erupted in November 2006, when a Ministry of Defence document leaked out, providing the actual sticker price on the fighter jets. The figure confirmed the long-held suspicion that the prices of the jets had been jacked up by at least 40% . BAE Systems, a crown jewel in the City of London financial/industrial structure, secured somewhere in the range of $80 billion in net profit from the arrangement— in league with BP and Royal Dutch Shell! Where did that money go, and what kinds of activities were financed with it? The answer to those questions, sources emphasize, holds the key to the power of Anglo-Dutch finance in the world today.40 n the spring of 2010, WikiLeaks published hundreds of I thousands of pages of allegedly sensitive material from American sources within the Taliban in Afghanistan, showing their links with senior members of the Pakistani intelligence services, not to mention a large quantity of diplomatic cables from U.S. officials revealing ‘geopolitical tensions’, some relevant and some merely entertaining. Afghanistan against the Soviet regime there.… According to London’s Financial Times, Gul’s name appeared “in about 10 of roughly 180 classified US files that allege that Pakistan’s intelligence service supported militants in Afghanistan fighting NATO forces.

You can also call these, confirmations and even vindication, depending on which side of the divide you are on. As well, in a UPI interview on September 26, 2001, two weeks after the 9/11 attacks, Gul stated, in reply to the question who did Black Sept. 11?, ‘Mossad and its accomplices. The US spends $40 billion a year on its 11 intelligence agencies. That’s $400 billion in 10 years. Yet the Bush Administration says it was taken by surprise. I don’t believe it. Within 10 minutes of the second twin tower being hit in the World Trade Center CNN said Osama bin Laden had done it. That was a planned piece of disinformation by the real perpetrators…’ Gul is clearly not well liked in Washington. He claims his request for travel visas to the UK and to the USA have repeatedly been denied. Making Gul into the archenemy would suit some in Washington nicely.… The naming of Gul today as a key liaison to the Afghan ‘Taliban’ forms part of a larger pattern of US and British recent efforts to demonize the current Pakistan regime as a key part of the problems in Afghanistan. Such a demonization greatly boosts the position of recent US military ally, India. Furthermore, Pakistan is the only Muslim country possessing atomic weapons. The Israeli Defense Forces and the Israeli Mossad intelligence agency reportedly would very much like to change that. A phony cam- Is there anything in the WikiLeaks documents on the U.S. military’s role in the booming Afghani drug trade? Not a word. Almost a million pages of WikiLeaks documents and not one word on the nefarious drug trade. How is that for a parallel universe of smoke and mirrors? It is beyond doubt that the United States army is in the spotlight for helping the Afghani warlords in transporting opium and heroin. What’s more, the CIA and the Pentagon are embroiled in a war of words, with each side accusing the other of controlling the drug trade in Afghanistan.

More than 100 categories dealing with Afghanistan and nothing on America’s role in the Afghani drug trade. In a nutshell, “by refusing to go after the opium trade, which is the logistical and financial backbone of the Taliban insurgency, the Obama policy is giving these narco-insurgents a free hand to kill American soldiers.”46 President Obama’s personal complicity in the opium treachery was demonstrated on March 28, 2010, when he made a 24-hour unannounced visit to Kabul, to scold Afghan President Karzai for his government’s corruption, but never mentioned the heroine and opium trade, which accounts for 90% of the world’s supply, and bankrolls the very Taliban insurgency that the US Administration purports to be combating.47 Needless to say, Obama’s visit made the news wires and its records appear in the WikiLeaks. Yet, we are led to believe by the mainstream press that the Pentagon/US Army drug trade connection is the exclusive domain of conspiracy theorists. In stark contrast to what the New York Times-WikiLeaks duopoly want us to believe about Obama’s policy in Afghanistan, … the Russian government has called upon the United States and NATO to collaborate on a full-scale war on the Afghan opium and heroin trade, which is the backbone of a global narco-insurgency, now running wild in Eurasia and the Americas, and which has been the cause of at least 1 million drug deaths from Afghan heroin overdoses over the past decade alone, according to United Nations data…. What’s worse, “under the U.S. occupancy, the Afghan opium business skyrocketed to the point that, as of 2007, Afghanistan was producing 95% of the world’s opium and heroin.… To be sure, the U.S. government’s policy for de facto support for the Afghan opium apparatus did not begin with the current occupant of the White House. Successive U.S. administrations, going back to 1979,”49 … have played a part in it. Jimmy Carter, Ronald Reagan, George H.W. Bush, Clinton, George W. Bush and now Obama. After more than thirty years of U.S. supported drug trade in the region, not a hint of it in the WikiLeaks documents. “The United States Institute for Peace, a Congressionally established and publicly funded research agency, published a 36-page dossier, ‘How Opium Profits the Taliban,’ … which spelled out how the Taliban had evolved into a narcotics cartel.… The insurgency is now synonymous with the narcotics trade.”50 Yes, if we are to believe the heavily redacted Wikileaks reports, the Taliban get the bulk of their funding through Saudi Arabia and Pakistan.

Right, and I am a cucumber. With the latest release of tens of thousands of pages of banking records and money laundering reports from the world’s largest financial institutions, notable for its absence is the complete silence on the ways and means of the international drug trade, supported entirely top down by the world’s most powerful banking cartels and governments. Does WikiLeaks mention the reprehensible drug trade and its undeniably close links to the United States government? Not a word. Could they be a part of “over 1.1 million documents”51 WikiLeaks received in 2006 but has yet to release to the public? As I explain in, Shadow Masters, according to a US Congressional Investigation conducted in 2001, “US and European banks launder between $500 billion and $1 trillion of international criminal proceeds each year, half of which is laundered by US banks alone. It is estimated that half of that money comes to the United States,” claims Michigan Senator Carl Levin. In other words, during the 1990s, between $2.5 and $5 trillion (criminal and corrupt money) had been laundered by US banks and circulated in the US financial system. According to informed observers, we can easily double this number today. What does it all mean? Without its illegal money, the US economy would collapse onto itself. That $250 and $500 billion per year of dirty money covers part of the US deficit in its balance of trade. “Without the ‘dirty money,’” stated James Petras, a professor at Binghamton University, “the US economy external accounts would be totally unsustainable, living standards would plummet, the dollar would weaken, the available investment and loan capital would shrink, and Washington would not be able to sustain its global empire.”52 With mainstream publications such as the Times, Guardian and der Spiegel being the arbiters of the truth, can we expect the real story to be told? I am not suggesting that these scions of the establishment media have hidden the information. They might not have access to it. However, if, as per Julian Assange correspondence, “WikiLeaks is an uncensorable version of wikipedia for untraceable mass document leaking and analysis,”53 the chances of such vital information not finding its way eventually into Assange’s hands is simply beyond belief. In another exchange, Assange stated candidly that “Our overarching goal is to provide a forum where embarrassing information can expose injustice.”54 Would government drug-money laundering qualify as embarrassing information?

I surely hope so. To restate the argument once more: “The New York Times, which employs members of the Council on Foreign Relations (CFR) including WikiLeaks’ collaborator David E. Sanger, has proven more than once to be a propaganda tool for the US government.”55 With the New York Times (Bilderberg, CFR), the Guardian (the left wing of the British intelligence agencies), Der Spiegel (Bilderberg), The London Economist (Bilderberg), “WikiLeaks has enlisted the architects of media disinformation to fight media disinformation: An incongruous and self-defeating procedure,”56 especially in light of past media transgressions. We are led to believe that money-laundering is the exclusive domain of Russian Mafiosi and their Italian and Colombian cousins plus a small group of unscrupulous Wall Street bankers. Far from it. Intimately involved in the money-laundering business are the most important banks in the US, sustaining America’s global power through management of illegally obtained overseas funds. Again quoting James Petras, “Washington and the mass media have portrayed the US as being in the forefront of the struggle against narco trafficking, drug laundering and political corruption: the image is of clean white hands fighting dirty money. The truth is exactly the opposite. US banks have developed a highly elaborate set of policies for transferring illicit funds to the US, investing those funds in legitimate businesses or US government bonds and legitimizing them.” There are two methods that premier banking institutions use to launder money: through private banks and through correspondent banking. Private banking caters to extremely wealthy clients, requiring minimum deposits of $1 million. Private banks are very attractive for money laundering because more than financial advice, they sell confidentiality to dirty-money clients. Private banks routinely use code names for accounts, establish “concentration accounts” which co-mingle bank funds with client funds (cutting off paper trails for billions of dollars of wire transfers), and set up offshore private investment corporations (PICs) in countries with strict secrecy laws, such as the Cayman Islands, the Bahamas, etc. “The second route that the big banks use to launder hundreds of billions of dirty money, ‘correspondent banking’ is a financial technique wherein illicit money is moved from bank to bank with ‘no questions asked,’ thereby cleansing funds prior to being used for legitimate purposes. In correspondent banking, one bank simply provides services to another in moving funds, exchanging currencies or carrying out other financial transactions. Since this is what banks do, why would a bank incur additional cost by hiring another to do the work?” WikiLeaks would surely know this.

According to US Congressional hearings, these accounts “give the owners and clients of poorly regulated, poorly managed, sometimes corrupt foreign banks, with weak or no anti-money laundering controls, direct access to the US financial system and the freedom to move money within the United States and around the world.”57 Needless to say, some of these customers would include drug dealers and others engaged in criminal activity. Some of the biggest banks specializing in international-fund transfer process up to $1 trillion in wire transfers per day.58 Would WikiLeaks have access to this information? Of course they would. After all, money is laundered through the world’s biggest banks, whose paper and electronic trail WikiLeaks has allegedly been exposing. Or have they? It is imperative to explain the whole nefarious business of drugs, to show just how improbable it would have been for WikiLeaks to miss the signs. Let’s start by saying that drug money is an inherent part of the American and world economy. In following global generated annually by the drug trade is somewhere around $900 billion. This figure includes heroin, opium, morphine, marijuana, cocaine, crack cocaine and hallucinogens. As noted, drug money is now “an essential part of the world banking and financial system because it provides the liquid cash necessary to make the ‘minimum monthly payments’ on huge stock and derivative and investment bubbles in the US and Britain.”59 How can $900 billion in illegal profits criss-crossing international borders get through the international banking system and past the eyes and ears of law enforcement authorities? The answer takes us behind the corporate board rooms and precious metal exchanges to the inner sanctum of some of the world’s wealthiest people: eight to ten generations of men who built their empires around the opium trade. This may seem more like fiction than fact. But fact it is recorded in the available documents at the National Library of Singapore, the National Archives of India, the University of London, the British Library, the Jardine Matheson Archives at the University of Cambridge Library, and the British East Indian Company Archives, as well as govern- ment records in Hong Kong and Macao. It began in the seventeenth century and involved a long succession of empire builders. This included Robert Clive and Warren Hastings in the eighteenth century, and Alexander Matheson, David Sasoon, the Perkins and the Codmans, the Russells and the Appletons, the Boylestons", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:WL0003SearchInside_cleaned.txt:78:1716f26a7c7a", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 6583, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "WL0003SearchInside_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/Deconstructing-Wikileaks-Daniel-Estulin/dp/1937584119", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "WL0003SearchInside_cleaned", "chunk_index": 79, "text": "Archives of India, the University of London, the British Library, the Jardine Matheson Archives at the University of Cambridge Library, and the British East Indian Company Archives, as well as govern- ment records in Hong Kong and Macao.

Opium represented fantastic gobs of money beyond anyone’s wildest dreams. Nobody needed to remind these men that money made the world go around. They were empire builders in the corridors of power, and filthy drug runners from the underbelly of history. We are talking about the most highly organized, top-down political machinery in the world, enjoying the logistical support of a $900 -billion-per-annum international cartel, and the protection of every political entity that Britain and the US have created through these vast invisible earnings. This protection applies not merely to growing and distribution, but to providing political, intelligence, and ideological support as well. Like international terrorism, it just can’t quite ever be stamped out: indicating that some of the biggest names in royal circles and the international oligarchy/plutocracy are the puppeteers, who manage through cut outs and intermediaries, concealing the identities of those pulling the strings. Nor should we forget the gigantic support facilities of the world’s official credit markets, the gold and diamond trade, and “hands-on” management of retail distribution, through organized crime. They are all derivatives of Drugs Incorporated. One purpose of the drug trade is to create unseen liquid capital, and to make it available to those wishing to gain an unfair advantage in the marketplace. This cash must go through nominally legitimate channels, in such mindboggling volumes that the banks and other financial institutions cannot possibly be unaware of the origin of the funds. The fact that most of this money flow is seasonal, completed during the two months following the March poppy harvest, can only add to our stupor. Banks pleading ignorance – “We didn’t know” – is simply absurd. The 900 billion dollars a year in illegal drug money benefits financial markets and especially Wall Street. That’s the reason for maintaining the illegal drug trade. From The Wilderness Contributing Editor Catherine Austin Fitts, George H.W.

Assuming that company has a stock market value that is a multiple of 20-30 times its profits, a handful of illiterate teenagers could generate approximately $2 − 3 million in stock market value for a major corporation, not to mention a nice flow of deposits and business for the Philadelphia banks and insurance companies…. “So if I have a company that has a $100, 000 of income and a stock trading at 20 times earnings, if I can find a way to run $100, 000 of narcotics sales by a few teenagers in West Philadelphia through my financial statements, I can get my stock market value to go up from $2 million to $4 million. I can double my “pop.” That is a quick $2 million profit from putting a few teenagers to work … The total stock market value generated in the Philadelphia area with $20–40 billion in narco retail sales would be about $80–160 billion. If you add all the things you could do with debt or and other ways to increase the multiples, and you could get that even higher, say $100–250 billion…. The problems this presents to people trying to run an honest business are numerous. The problems it creates for our work ethic and culture are numerous too. It increasingly puts the low performance people in charge, and everyone starts to behave like and follow them….”60 What does this mean in the world of high finance? If firms like Hong Kong and Shanghai Bank, Bank of Nova Scotia, Royal Bank of Scotland, Chase Manhattan Bank, Citibank, or General Electric were to have an additional $40 million in earnings from the drug trade, with a price-to-earnings multiplier of 20, the net increase in their company’s equity would be $800 million.

If firms like Hong Kong and Shanghai Bank, Bank of Nova Scotia, Royal Bank of Scotland, Chase Manhattan Bank, Citibank, or General Electric were to have an additional $40 million in earnings from the drug trade, with a price-to-earnings multiplier of 20, the net increase in their company’s equity would be $800 million. If you still believe that there cannot really be major, hands-on, institutional involvement in the drug trade, you will be surprised to hear that in late June 1999, numerous news services, including the Associated Press, reported that Richard A. Grasso, then Chairman of the New York Stock Exchange, flew down to Colombia for a jungle encounter with a spokesperson for Raul Reyes of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Columbia (FARC). FARC is Colombia’s major narco-terrorist outfit, with which the United States government is unofficially at war. The purpose of the trip was “to bring a message of co-operation from US financial services”61 and to discuss foreign investment and the future role of US businesses in Colombia. What does Colombia have that the United States could possibly want? Money – drug money: over a trillion dollars in equity that has been building up in Colombia for over thirty years now. These are practically limitless resources that make Wall Street salivate at the thought of channelling them through its financial markets. However, before they can channel this money into actual year-end results, something needs to be done to legitimize it. Unlike one hundred and fifty years ago, profits from the lucrative drug trade are illegal. That’s another thing often overlooked by people trying to understand how the entire nefarious business of drugs works. Before that money can be used legally, it needs to hide, then be laundered. You can’t hide nine hundred billion dollars in a mattress. “The money moves so quickly that, unless one were in control of the computer systems that handle it, or the software that manages it, it would be impossible to trace.”62 Ignorance, therefore, especially when the laundering transactions are gigantic ones, is not a tenable position. Additionally, corporations can earn a fantastic amount of money by borrowing illegal money from drug dealers and drug-dealing nations at a lower interest rate and laundering it into astronomical profits. When 100 billion dollars of useless illegal money is loaned at five percent to a giant corporation, the money, in turn becomes legal and liquid. “Le Monde Diplomatique, the premier information source for international diplomats, found US intelligence services, banks, and other multinational corporations at the top of a huge global network of organized crime and money laundering.… [It cited] “cartels, insider dealing and speculation, fraudulent balance sheets, embezzlement of public funds, spying, blackmail, and betrayal, among a host of other seamy practices.

But these cannot succeed without governments willing to ‘keep restrictive regulations to a minimum, to abolish or override such rules as do exist, to paralyse inquiries … and to reduce or grant amnesty from any penalties.’”63 to their eyeballs in drugs. In the aforementioned article, Le Monde Diplomatique explicitly stated that “the secret services of the world’s most powerful state apparatus … have moved into economic warfare,”64 becoming “international financial crime’s number-one partner.”65 The same charge can be levelled at the British Foreign Intelligence (MI6), the Israeli Mossad, French DGSE, Russian FSB, not to mention intelligence agencies from Morocco, Colombia, Honduras, El Salvador, Venezuela, Panama, Dominican Republic, the Philippines and beyond. Christian de Brie and Jean de Maillard, in that brilliant article for Le Monde Diplomatique’s April 2000 issue, describe a tangible “operating system” of international drug capital flow: “By allowing capital to flow unchecked from one end of the world to the other, globalization and abandon of sovereignty have together fostered the explosive growth of an outlaw financial market. It is a coherent system closely linked to the expansion of modern capitalism and based on an association of three partners: governments, transnational corporations and Mafias. “Business is business: financial crime is first and foremost a market, thriving and structured, ruled by supply and demand. Big business complicity and political laisser faire is the only way that large scale organized crime can launder and recycle the fabulous proceeds of its activities. And the transnationals need the support of governments and the neutrality of regulatory authorities in order to consolidate their positions, increase their profits, withstand and crush the competition, pull off the ‘deal of the century’ and finance their illicit operations. Politicians are directly involved and their ability to intervene depends on the backing and the funding that keep them in power. This collusion of interests is an essential part of the world economy, the oil that keeps the wheels of capitalism turning.”66 In other words, drugs are big business, run, controlled and protected by very powerful people who work alongside leading banking institutions on both sides of the Atlantic, members of various governments and principal corporations whose stock is traded on the world’s leading stock exchanges. One such institution is the Hong Kong and Shanghai Corporation (BHSH). Out of the second Opium War (1858-60), the British merchant banks and trading companies established BHSH, “which to this day serves as the central clearinghouse for all Far Eastern financial transactions relating to", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:WL0003SearchInside_cleaned.txt:82:fed6e6d6019e", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 6587, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "WL0003SearchInside_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/Deconstructing-Wikileaks-Daniel-Estulin/dp/1937584119", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "WL0003SearchInside_cleaned", "chunk_index": 83, "text": "controlled and protected by very powerful people who work alongside leading banking institutions on both sides of the Atlantic, members of various governments and principal corporations whose stock is traded on the world’s leading stock exchanges.

Out of the second Opium War (1858-60), the British merchant banks and trading companies established BHSH, “which to this day serves as the central clearinghouse for all Far Eastern financial transactions relating to the black market in opium and its heroin derivatives.”67 Another suspect is Canada’s Bank of Nova Scotia, now headquartered in Toronto. On the one hand, it serves as a major gold dealer and leader of the Toronto gold market, and on the other, it serves as banker for giant Canadian mining companies operating in the third world. According to knowledgeable US intelligence sources, the Bank of Nova Scotia may be a major dirty money operator in the Caribbean, running flight-capital against currency restrictions, a serious violation of local currency laws. “How do banks with their great air of respectability fit into the drug trade with all of its attendant filth?”68 One way is by financing legitimate purchases of companies registered and licensed to do business as importers of chemicals. The Hong Kong and Shanghai Bank is “right in the middle of such trade through a company called Tejapaibul, which banks with BHSH. What does this company do? It imports into Hong Kong most of the chemicals”69 needed to process raw opium into heroin by the diacetylation of morphine with acetic anhydride, the irreplaceable chemical agent in heroin processing. Acetic anhydride is also used in the conversion of cellulose into acetate, a component of photographic film, and in the production of aspirin. It should be no surprise, then, that the largest markets for diverted acetic anhydride continue to be in Afghanistan. The virtue of patience is rewarded in the business of countering counter-intelligence, the web of deceit employing disinformation called psy-ops to put spin on the reality of facts, which cannot be otherwise concealed. With certain training and identifiable targets, the sniper out to expose liars need only wait for a mistake to be made. 13, 2010. 14 http://www.outlookindia.com/article.aspx?213547 15 Elizabeth Gould & Paul Fitzgerald, “Thinking outside the box?

Hatonn, Political Psychos, Phoenix Source Publishers, p.36, 1994. n the second volume of his magnificent trilogy, Sinister Forces, author Peter Levenda writes: “Richard Mellon I Scaife, scion of the Mellon fortune and heavy financial backer of the conservative movement in America – including the campaign to discredit and eventually impeach Bill Clinton – made a most revealing remark when he addressed the Heritage Foundation in the heady days of the Republican Party winning control of Congress in the November 1994 election. He said that ‘ideological conflicts’ had ‘swirled about this nation for half a century,’ that is since about 1945. Further, he warned that the nation was on the verge of breaking out into ‘ideological warfare in which the very foundations of our republic are threatened.’ This can not be understood without reference to the last days of the Second World War, and the polarization of the two most powerful American political parties on either side of the right-versus-left conflict, as Nazis were being recruited into the American intelligence, aerospace, medical and scientific establishment as a means of combating the Communist threat. “Deep into the Clinton presidency, a right-wing ideologue was giving voice to what a generation of conservatives and rightist Republicans feared most: that with the collapse of the Soviet Union and the demonstration that Communism was politically bankrupt, America would not take the initiative and extend its hegemony – even, according to some, Taken together, this was nothing less than a redesign of the American political and religious environment, an attempt to create a new country, one worthy of the mantle of global liberator, a liberator with its eyes on the domination not only of the world, but of space, as well.

And, in order to create this new country, this new spiritual paradigm with new rules of engagement and a strange new morality in which some of the most brutal regimes the world has ever known – the Nazis and the Imperial Japanese – would become our allies against ‘godless Communists’ and the ‘yellow peril,’ we had to take measures that were harsh and ruthless. The war against Communism took more out of American society than the war against Nazism. For one thing, it lasted much longer and, as Communism was an “international” enemy and painted as more truly an ideological enemy than Nazism, anyone could be a Communist. Your neighbor, your boss, your employee, your brother, your senator and even—in the eyes of some—your president. America turned inward upon itself in its search for socialists, Communists, “reds” in general and their fellow-travelers. While Eleanor Roosevelt and Albert Einstein and Helen Douglas were in New York City raising consciousness and voice against the importation of war criminals under the Operation Paperclip program, the Dulles brothers and Richard Nixon were plotting an extension of that program to include thousands more. It was an ideological conflict that perhaps had its origins in American history decades if not centuries earlier, but which only became refined and fine-tuned during the war years.1 Against the backdrop of frightening conflict in Southeast Asia, with images of American soldiers returning home in flag-draped coffins, America learned that it was secretly wiping out entire villages of Viet Cong collaborators and sympathizers. America learned that the White House operated on quite another level, one of realpolitik, one that did not respect Congress and the laws it had passed. America learned that people in positions of power and influence (non-elected positions) had nothing but disdain and contempt for the elected officials of Congress. But then, what did we expect from a Richard Nixon? And all this in the midst of Vietnam, Laos, Cambodia, African revolutions and Latin American coups d’etat. The real and the ideal were mixed in a kaleidoscopic mural of love, hate and death, hope and despair. As Vietnam turned into Watergate, reality itself became the circus of the bizarre. We learned more during the Watergate hearings than we ever wanted to know. Crooked politicians we could deal with, and have dealt with since the founding of the country; but crooked spies, rogue intelligence operations, foreign adventures unsupported by an electorate glued to their television sets during prime time soap opera extravaganzas… this was more than most Americans could understand.2 Gradually, entertainment became reality, and reality, entertainment.

Not long after that, entertainment became king. Dead men and body bags. With Vietnam, there was an example of a new kind of post-war Romanticism: horror in movies was acceptable if it was real. With the Pentagon Papers and Daniel Ellsberg, we had a new kind of entertainment. Consider Daniel Ellsberg, working within the US government during the Vietnam War. He comes into contact with the Pentagon Papers, a meticulously kept record of military and strategic planning throughout the war. Those papers reveal the depths to which the US government has sunk in deceiving the population about the war. Yet the public and the media know nothing of this urgent and shocking information. Indeed, secrecy laws are being used to keep the public ignorant of gross dishonesty practised by their government. In spite of those secrecy laws and at great personal risk, Ellsberg manages to disseminate the Pentagon papers to journalists and to the world. Despite facing criminal charges, eventually dropped, the release of the Pentagon papers shocks the world, exposes the government, and helps to shorten the war and save thousands of lives.3 We have come to the conclusion that fomenting a world wide movement of mass leaking is the most cost effective political intervention available to us^(*) We believe that injustice is answered by good governance and for there to be good governance there must be open governance. Governance by stealth is governance by conspiracy and fear. Fear, because without it, secrecy does not last for long. Retired generals and diplomats are vociferous, but those in active service hold their tune. This degeneration comes about because when injustice is concealed, including plans for future injustice, it cannot be addressed. When governance is closed, man’s eyes become cataracts. When governance is open, man can see and so act to move the world towards a more just state; for instance see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reporters_Without_Borders which shows a striking correlation between press freedom and countries known for their quality of life. 1) Retired new york architect and notorious intelligence leak facilitator 2) Euro cryptographer/programmer 3) Pacific physicist and illustrator 4) A pacific author and economic policy lecturer 5) Euro, Ex-Cambridge mathematician/cryptographer/pro grammer 6) Euro businessman and security specialist/activist 7) Author of software than runs 40% of the world’s websites. 8) US pure mathematician with criminal law background 9) An infamous US ex-hacker 10) Pacific cryptographer/physicist and activist 11) US/euro cryptographer and activist/programmer 12) Pacific programmer 13) Pacific architect / foreign policy wonk Firstly, we have crossed over from ‘prospective’ to ‘projective.’ The basic technology has been prototyped", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:WL0003SearchInside_cleaned.txt:87:2232cd7942c7", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 6592, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "WL0003SearchInside_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/Deconstructing-Wikileaks-Daniel-Estulin/dp/1937584119", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "WL0003SearchInside_cleaned", "chunk_index": 88, "text": "and illustrator 4) A pacific author and economic policy lecturer 5) Euro, Ex-Cambridge mathematician/cryptographer/pro grammer 6) Euro businessman and security specialist/activist 7) Author of software than runs 40% of the world’s websites. 8) US pure mathematician with criminal law background 9) An infamous US ex-hacker 10) Pacific cryptographer/physicist and activist 11) US/euro cryptographer and activist/programmer 12) Pacific programmer 13) Pacific architect / foreign policy wonk Firstly, we have crossed over from ‘prospective’ to ‘projective.’ The basic technology has been prototyped and we have a view as how we must proceed politically and legally.

The regionalization of the second prize is to encourage patrons of similar awards in other countries. Although it is premature to go into detail, we have designed a scheme were this can be meaningfully awarded to anonymous leakers. We have been pledged substantial initial funding. n the middle of 1967, Robert S. McNamara, who was then I Secretary of Defense, made what turned out to be one of his most important decisions in his seven years at the Pentagon. He commissioned a study that has since became known as the Pentagon Papers – an allegedly “massive topsecret history of the United States role in Indochina. The result was approximately 3,000 pages of narrative history and more than 4,000 pages of appended documents – an estimated total of 2.5 million words. The 47 volumes cover American involvement in Indochina from World War II to May 1968, the month that peace talks began in Paris”5 after President Johnson had set a limit on further military commitments and revealed his intention to retire. Pentagon Papers “revealed that the United States government had been misrepresenting the facts of the Vietnam War’s chances of success.”6 As the official story goes, Department of Defense employee and one-time hippie, Daniel Ellsberg, allegedly leaked a treasure trove of Top Secret papers to the New York Times which began publishing a series of articles on June 13, 1971.

As L. Marcus (Lyndon LaRouche) explains in the April 1974 issue of the Campaigner magazine: “The essential thrust of the project was the assembly of selected actual documents (many initially created by the CIA or based on the CIA briefings) and supplementary materials whose overall intended effect was to exonerate the CIA from responsibility for a wide variety of unpopular military and related developments which the CIA itself had chiefly authored. In essence, the effect of the ‘Pentagon Papers’ was – for anyone credulous enough to believe them – to whitewash the CIA for its own activities.”9 This is absolutely consistent with methodology using a select collection of authentic documents employed to deceive as described in The Secret Team10 by Colonel Prouty, former Joint Chiefs of Staff/CIA liason. Colonel Prouty pointed out that the Pentagon Papers had been a deliberately engineered psychological operation to shift political responsibility, in the public eye, for the colossal intelligence and policy failures in Vietnam, stating: “This psy-ops trick does not conceal the policy failures, that cannot be done. What is actually happening here is a deliberate twist put on the facts to further the political agenda of one party undermining another party with dirty tricks.”11 tradition of the czarist Okhrana’s notorious anti-Semitic pioneering venture into modern ‘Black’ psychological warfare, the Czarist-authored ‘protocols of Zion.’ Such ‘secret’ documents are written for the purpose of affording them the widest possible public attention. The ‘top secret’ classification is the fine hand of the public relations specialist, who thereby assures himself that his handywork will receive the widest circulation and simultaneously evoke the maximum awe from among the credulous public.”12 Before touching on the WikiLeaks hoax, I would like to explain how the Pentagon Papers hoax was accomplished. “Would the CIA arrange for its publication in a way which would be directly attributed to its sponsorship? Scarcely! A devious confidence man’s procedure was indicated. Through Ellsberg’s performance, the desired effect was secured.

An outright fraud was hallowed for a gullible public by representing the concoction as ‘a most secret document, filched from the most intimate files of the most all-powerful agencies at unspeakable risk by an astonishingly courageous, conscience-striken’ … CIA operative!”13 That’s right. Ellsberg, after all was a lifetime CIA employee. As of this date, no secret has been made of the general way in which the so-called ‘Pentagon Papers’ were ‘compiled.’ Firstly, “the papers were not compiled by or for the ‘Pentagon,’ but on behalf of the CIA, with complicity of such CIA adjuncts as the RAND Corporation, with the selection and supplementary concoction of included documents.14 Ellsberg, who inexplicably remains a hero and a ‘patriot’ to most leftists, was a nuclear weapons planner from the RAND Corporation, as well as a member of Henry Kissinger’s staff at the White House. We were told that he had a Damascus Road conversion, became antiwar and, allegedly in an effort to stop the war, released documents. Marcus places the blame for making the Pentagon Papers hoax possible on one of the more beloved ‘left wing’ intellectuals, MIT Professor Noam Chomsky. Marcus states: “the manner in which the desired leak was effected is only less ‘hairy’ than the papers themselves. To explain how and why a right wing CIA operative, Ellsberg, an associate of general Ed Lansdale, could be converted, the public has been told that the convenient ‘Damascus Road’ transformation was accomplished under the influence of Professor Noam Chomsky of MIT, an individual with a credible standing as a leading anti war activist. Chomsky’s role as the official dupe in the affair grows murky when we note Chomsky’s endorsement of the hoax after its publication. As a leading anti-war activist, Chomsky had abundant access to all the knowledge necessary to spot the whitewashing of the CIA as a blatant fraud.”16 General” Edward Lansdale was a CIA man and Deputy Assistant Secretary of the Pentagon’s Office of Special Operations at the time of the planning of the Bay of Pigs. He was the head of the top secret intelligence project known as ‘Operation Mongoose,’ “drawn up after President John F. Kennedy had shifted responsibility for dealing with Cuba, in late 1961, from the CIA to the Department of Defense (DOD), in the aftermath of the Bay of Pigs. … According to documents that were intended to have been destroyed almost 40 years ago, top levels of the U.S. military proposed carrying out acts of terrorism against the United States in the early 1960s, in order to drag the United States into a war", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:WL0003SearchInside_cleaned.txt:90:6638c1b631d5", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 6595, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "WL0003SearchInside_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/Deconstructing-Wikileaks-Daniel-Estulin/dp/1937584119", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "WL0003SearchInside_cleaned", "chunk_index": 91, "text": "Mongoose,’ “drawn up after President John F.

That agenda coincidentally serves to buttress the agenda of US geopolitics around the world from Iran to Russia to North Korea and Pakistan.”19 “A professionally engineered psychological operation, it shifted, for the public consumption, responsibility for the colossal intelligence and policy failures in Vietnam, from the CIA to the military.”22 In the end, only the CIA and their close friends in the military/industrial complex who profit from war, and those promoted CIA agents in military service cover, benefited. Accountability never happened. Now, with Afghanistan becoming a colossal political and military failure, the ‘goal posts’ have been moved again, changing the direction of the emphasis from Afghanistan to the two regional powerhouses, Iran and Pakistan. The story on the surface makes for a script for a new Oliver Stone Hollywood thriller. A 39-year old Australian hacker holds the President of the United States and his State Department hostage to a gigantic cyber ‘leak,’ unless the President leaves Julian Assange and his WikiLeaks free to release hundreds of thousands of pages of sensitive US Government memos.… It is almost too perfectly-scripted to be true. A discontented 22-year old US Army soldier on duty in Baghdad, Bradley Manning, a low-grade US Army intelligence analyst, described as a loner, a gay in the military, a disgruntled ‘computer geek,’ sifts through classified information at Forward Operating Base Hammer. He decides to secretly download US State Department email communications from the entire world over a period of eight months for hours a day, onto his blank CDs while pretending to be listening to Lady Gaga. In addition to diplomatic cables, Manning is believed to have provided WikiLeaks with helicopter gun camera video of an errant US attack in Baghdad on unarmed journalists, and with war logs from Iraq and Afghanistan.

He allegedly told the US hacker that the documents he had contained ‘incredible, awful things that belonged in the public domain and not on some server stored in a dark room in Washington, DC.’ The hacker turned him in to US authorities so the story goes. Manning is now incommunicado in U.S. military confinement so we cannot ask him, conveniently. The Pentagon routinely hires the best hackers to design their security systems. Then the plot thickens. The 250,000 pages end up at the desk of Julian Assange, the 39-year-old Australian founder of a supposedly anti-establishment website with the cute name WikiLeaks. Assange decides to selectively choose several of the world’s most ultra-establishment news media to exclusively handle the leaking job for him as he seems to be on the run from Interpol, not for leaking classified information, but for allegedly having consensual sex with two Swedish women who later decided it was rape. He selects as exclusive newspapers to decide what is to be leaked the New York Times which did such service in promoting faked propaganda against Saddam that led to the Iraqi war, the London Guardian and Der Spiegel. Assange claims he had no time to sift through so many pages so handed them to the trusted editors of the establishment media for them to decide what should be released. Very ‘anti-establishment’ that.… Most important, the 250,000 cables are not ‘top secret’ as we might have thought. Between two and three million US Government employees are cleared to see this level of ‘secret’ document, and some 500,000 people around the world have access to the Secret Internet Protocol Network (SIPRnet) where the cables were stored. Siprnet is not recommended for distribution of top-secret information. Only 6% or 15,000 pages of the documents have been classified as even secret, a level below top-secret. Another 40% were the lowest level, ‘confidential’, while the rest were unclassified. In brief, it was not all that secret.… But for anyone who has studied the craft of intelligence and of disinformation, a clear pattern emerges in the WikiLeaks drama. The focus is put on select US geopolitical targets, appearing as Hillary Clinton put it ‘to justify US sanctions against Iran.’ They claim North Korea with China’s granting of free passage to Korean ships despite US State Department pleas, send dangerous missiles to Iran.

Saudi Arabia’s ailing King Abdullah reportedly called Iran’s President a Hitler.23 On 21 May, a Californian computer hacker called Adrian Lamo was contacted by somebody with the online name Bradass87 who started to swap instant messages with him. He was immediately extraordinarily open: ‘hi… how are you?… im an army intelligence analyst, deployed to eastern bagdad … if you had unprecedented access to classified networks, 14 hours a day, 7 days a week for ⁸⁺ months, what would you do?’ For five days, Bradass87 opened his heart to Lamo. He described how his job gave him access to two secret networks: the Secret Internet Protocol Router Network, SIPRNET, which carries US diplomatic and military intelligence classified “secret”; and the Joint Worldwide Intelligence Communications System which uses a different security system to carry similar material classified up to ‘top secret’. He said this had allowed him to see ‘incredible things, awful things … that belong in the public domain and not on some server stored in a dark room in Washington DC … almost criminal political backdealings … the non-PR version of world events and crises.’ “Bradass87 suggested that ‘someone I know intimately’ had been downloading and compressing and encrypting all this data and uploading it to someone he identified as Julian Assange. At times, he claimed he himself had leaked the material, suggesting that he had taken in blank CDs, labelled as Lady Gaga’s music, slotted them into his high-security laptop and lip-synched to non-existent music to cover his downloading: ‘I want people to see the truth,’ he said. He dwelled on the abundance of the disclosure: ‘its open diplomacy … its Climategate with a global scope and breathtaking depth … its beautiful and horrifying … It’s public data, it belongs in the public domain.” At one point, Bradass87 caught himself and said: “i can’t believe what im confessing to you.” It was too late.

And chat logs are notoriously (easy to) forge by authorities and other people, as with other digital stuff. So I don’t know whether there’s anything to this or not. But I’m following it because it’s kind of a test of how gullible people can be with a good story. And all frauds work that way. The more one looks at the official story, the more it appears to be a well-orchestrated sting operation. In an interview with CNET, John Young made the following observation: “There was suspicion from day one that this was entrapment run by someone unknown to suck a number of people into a trap. So we actually don’t know. But it’s certainly a standard counterintelligence technique. And they’re usually pretty elaborate and pretty carefully run. They’ll even prosecute people as part of the cover story.”26 Bradley Manning may get prosecuted and may even spend some time in jail. Most knowledgeable observers believe, however, that he is a part of the operation and will see relatively little prison time. Will the status quo try to conceal who was informing and betraying others by pretending to prosecute them. For example,: “High-grade crypto hides any header to avoid disclosing the methodology used. A header may be separately encrypted, coded as blank spaces or punctuation, hidden as innocuous fragments, miniaturized and placed under a digitally-transparent character and other admirably sneaky methods. Other markers are embedded to trace, log and reveal to a recipient evidence of tampering and cracking. Decrypted contents will also contain markers to track distribution and use, and may also contain trojans and/or computer destructors unless disarmed. Whether there is embedded lethality triggerable by misuse is unknown but surely in the works. A dirty trick is to wrap an alluring encrypted package with a transparent trojan in the manner of spam. The endless stream of spam, viruses, searches, bots, clouds, data dumps, advertisements and social media chatter cloak that. What may be wrapped around, hidden and ticking within, infecting, the alluring insurance file is likely to be unpleasant.”27 What is emerging from all the sound and WikiLeaks fury in Washington is that the entire scandal is serving to advance a long-standing Obama and Bush agenda of policing the until-now free Internet. Already the US Government has shut the WikiLeaks server in the United States though no identifiable US law has been broken.

Already the US Government has shut the WikiLeaks server in the United States though no identifiable US law has been broken. The process of policing the Web was well underway before the current leaks scandal. In 2009 Democratic Senator Jay Rockefeller and Republican Olympia Snowe introduced the Cybersecurity Act of 2009 (S.773). It would give the President unlimited power to disconnect privatesector computers from the internet. The bill ‘would allow the president to ‘declare a cyber-security emergency’ relating to ‘non-governmental’ computer networks and do what’s necessary to respond to the threat.’ We can expect that this controversial piece of legislation will get top priority now when a new Republican House and the Senate convene in January. The US Department of Homeland Security, an agency created in the political hysteria following 9/11 2001 that has been compared to the Gestapo, has already begun policing the Internet. They are quietly seizing and shutting down internet websites (web domains) without due process or a proper trial. DHS simply seizes web domains that it wants to and posts an ominous “Department of Justice” logo on the web site. See an example at http:// torrent-finder.com. Over 75 websites were seized and shut in a recent week. Right now, their focus is websites that they claim ‘violate copyrights,’ yet the torrent-finder. com website that was seized by DHS contained no copyrighted content whatsoever. It was merely a search engine website that linked to destinations where people could access copyrighted content. Step by careful step freedom of speech can be taken away. Then what?28 Suppose that the United States Government, or more likely an unaccountable privatized intelligence colossus empowered by the reaction to the 9/11 attacks and fueled by the rampant cronyism of a system long ago gone rotten had a surveillance tool capable of peering into the most private aspects of American lives on a whim. Now suppose that the new growth industry of a previously unthinkable futuristic police state was already in place, is fully operational and has in fact been online and has been actively utilized for illegal domestic spying purposes for years, and that it was being used well before those two airplanes slammed into the World Trade Center. The ‘terrorist’ attacks were then and have been used as the justification for every unconstitutional reigning in of civil liberties ever since that heinous September morning seven years ago when the reset button was hit on two and a quarter centuries of American history and we all stepped forth into the brave new world of perpetual war, fear, suspicion and vengeance into a parallel reality in a place that would come to be ominously", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:WL0003SearchInside_cleaned.txt:95:17154b79efa5", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 6600, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "WL0003SearchInside_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/Deconstructing-Wikileaks-Daniel-Estulin/dp/1937584119", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "WL0003SearchInside_cleaned", "chunk_index": 96, "text": "slammed into the World Trade Center.

What if this surveillance industrial complex was in possession of a database that was so large and so powerful that not only could it instantly process and retrieve the most minute or intimate aspects of a citizen’s lives but was also able to utilize extremely sophisticated artificial intelligence capabilities to actually predict likely patterns of future behavior.” Such a huge database would be able to use cutting edge technology funded with taxpayer dollars and awarded to unaccountable private corporations largely through ‘business as usual’ no bid contracts to create the most invasive tool of oppression this country has ever seen. This database would rely on software that was capable of performing social network analysis based on block modeling technology to monitor all forms of electronic communications, all internet searches, all debit and credit card transac- tions, all travel arrangements, all library records, all bank activity and all telephone records. It would then be able to use the data to not only find links between persons who already know and interact with each other but to categorize each individual into a particular group that possess similar behavioral and purchasing habits. These groups could then be further divided into subgroups and further analyzed in order to determine under some loosely defined and largely unknown guidelines whether they could potentially represent a threat. While all of this may sound like some sort of futuristic dystopian nightmare straight out of Philip K. Dick’s Minority Report and ‘Pre-crime’ it is very real and it goes by the name of Main Core. For example, if you are selling a bicycle and run an advertisement in your local newspaper and you happen to receive a call from a Muhammad who is interested in your bicycle and Muhammad happens to have certain friends who have relationships with an organization that is determined by some unknown criteria to be a potential terrorist organization then the call that you received from Muhammad would then in all likelihood place you in the database and subject to an increased level of scrutiny at best and at worst in jeopardy of being picked up and held indefinitely without any sort of judicial review.

Throw in an overworked, systematically dumbed-down populace that has been propagandized by the corrupt institution that is the corporate media machine with it’s clever use of fear and loathing and scientific development of advanced mind control techniques who despite the infinite wisdom of our forefathers would gladly sacrifice their liberty for the any sort of temporary safety (no matter that it is fleeting) and there exists today in ‘The Homeland’ a perfect petri dish for an authoritarian fascist society. It is though a very sophisticated form of fascism unlike more outwardly obvious regimes that we have known in the past. Author Bertram Gross published a book back in 1980 that was entitled Friendly Fascism, Jim Garrison once said that “fascism would come to America in the name of national security,” and author Kevin Phillips in his 1983 book Post-Conservative America warned of the potential of an ‘apple pie authoritarianism’ and a coming society in which: ‘the Star Spangled Banner would wave with greater frequency and over many more parades; increased surveillance would crack down on urban outbreaks and extreme political dissidents’. This very accurately describes post 9/11 America where any semblance of reason has been abandoned for cheap flag-waving pimped off as patriotism, criticism of authority has made into potential treason by the highly paid shills for neoconservative doctrine, sloganeering and demagoguery have replaced discourse, critical thinking is becoming extinct and just as George Orwell so accurately predicted Big Brother is now watching over us, protecting us and ensuring that we understand that war is peace, freedom is slavery and ignorance is strength.29 According to a number of experts, WikiLeaks may well be “a theatre operation. Partly lulling, partly testing systems. Testing public reaction, are we going to get traction out of cyber threats or not. Will this work or not, because as you know they (WikiLeaks) haven’t caused any harm that is why they haven’t been charged… and then there will be some lives lost or something will happen… and at some point when this cyber war becomes a real war, we will see because the laws will be ready.”30", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:WL0003SearchInside_cleaned.txt:97:262036d0328b", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 6602, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "001103mdwpentagonattack.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "001103mdwpentagonattack", "chunk_index": 0, "text": "Pentagon Attack Exercise Before 9/11 ** Pentagon Attack Exercise Before 9/11** Missing Link Click Below to See Previously Downloaded Article This is one of many documents on the 9/11 summary to have disappeared since the WantToKnow.info site was established.

Defense Protective Services Police seal the crash sight. Army medics, nurses and doctors scramble to organize aid. An Arlington Fire Department chief dispatches his equipment to the affected areas. Don Abbott, of Command Emergency Response Training, walks over to the Pentagon and extinguishes the flames. The Pentagon was a model and the \"plane crash\" was a simulated one. The Pentagon Mass Casualty Exercise, as the crash was called, was just one of several scenarios that emergency response teams were exposed to Oct. 24-26 in the Office of the Secretaries of Defense conference room. On Oct. 24, there was a mock terrorist incident at the Pentagon Metro stop and a construction accident to name just some of the scenarios that were practiced to better prepare local agencies for real incidents. To conduct the exercise, emergency personnel hold radios that are used to rush help to the proper places, while toy trucks representing rescue equipment are pushed around the exercise table. Cards are then passed out to the various players designating the number of casualties and where they should be sent in a given scenario. To conduct the exercise, a medic reports to Army nurse Maj.

Hopefully it will never happen, but this way we're prepared.\" An Army medic found the practice realistic. \"You get to see the people that we'll be dealing with and to think about the scenarios and what you would do,\" Sgt. Kelly Brown said. \"It's a real good scenario and one that could happen easily.\" A major player in the exercise was the Arlington Fire Department. \"Our role is fire and rescue,\" Battalion Chief R.W. Cornwell said. \"We get to see how each other operates and the roles and responsibilities of each. You have to plan for this. Look at all the air traffic around here.\" Each participant was required to fill out an evaluation form after the training exercise. \"We go over scenarios that are germane to the Pentagon,\" Jake Burrell of the Pentagon Emergency Management Team said. 'You play the way you practice. We want people to go back to their organizations and look at their S.O.P. (standard operating procedure) and see how they responded to any of the incidents.\" Burrell has coordinated these exercises for four years and he remarked that his team gets better each year. Abbott, in his after action critique, reminded the participants that the actual disaster is only one-fifth of the incident and that the whole emergency would run for seven to 20 days and might involve as many as 17 agencies. \"The emergency to a certain extent is the easiest part,\" Abbott said. He reminded the group of the personal side of a disaster. \"Families wanting to come to the crash site for closure.\" In this particular crash there would have been 341 victims.

Is Texas Gov. George W. Bush right that it's with machines? Or is Vice President Gore correct that it's with human hand counts? Experts say that neither is exactly right. Nor exactly wrong. They say hand counts and machines are both needed to do the job right. Many legislatures have reached the same conclusion. Bush signed such a process into law in Texas in 1997. \"Machine and hand counts are a good check and balance on each other,\" says Todd Urosevich, a vice president at Election Systems & Software Inc. of Omaha. In close races, machines are only as good as the ballots they're reading. \"What you are looking at is that voters will not, cannot or just plain do not follow instructions,\" says Doug Lewis, executive director of the Election Center, a non-partisan, non-profit group in Houston that trains elections officials. Machines also are not foolproof. They can and do overlook flaws, such as incompletely punched holes on ballots. People aren't the perfect alternative either. They can read only so many ballots without wearing down. That's why, Lewis says, the prayer of election officials everywhere is: \"God, please let the winner win in a landslide.\" Mechanical lever machines were first used in 1892. The punch-card-reading machines made their debut in 1964. William Rouverol, the mechanical engineer who built the prototype punch card reader, says the country went to this system because it wanted faster results. Machines also reduced the manpower needed to count the increasing number of ballots cast by a growing country. By then, allegations were prevalent that elections had been rigged and stolen by corrupt people doing the counting. Converting to mechanized vote counting brought \"integrity\" to elections in the USA, says Urosevich, whose company makes punch-card-reading machines and other voting systems. But the machines are only as good as the ballots they are asked to read. Relying on people alone to do the counting also can be problematic, especially when they are counting hundreds of thousands of ballots. \"The mind gets tired, the eyes get tired, the body gets tired,\" Lewis says. In a new USA TODAY/CNN/Gallup Poll of 870 adults Sunday, the public perceives machines as more accurate than humans, 58%-35%. The poll had a margin of error of +/- 4 percentage points. Urosevich says machines that read punch cards are 99.9% accurate, and maybe as much as 99.999% right. In a close contest, that's not as good as it sounds. In Florida, where 6 million votes were cast, machines with 99.9% accuracy could have mistakenly rejected 6,000 votes. Machines with 99.99% could have kicked out 600.

In Florida, the state Supreme Court is being asked to choose between man and machine. \"I think the real question is: Who gets to decide, and who do we accept as the final decision-maker?\" says Paul Rothstein, a law professor at Georgetown University in Washington. \"Is it the Florida Supreme Court?
