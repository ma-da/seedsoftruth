Webb knew what kind of person he didn’t want. His choice couldn’t be any one of the lawyers who had acted as technical advisers on Hollywood movies – in the world’s movie capital that consideration actually eliminated a good many in the DA’s office. The prosecutor had to be resistant to Hollywood. “I wouldn’t say you could become corrupted,” Webb noted, “but you could be awed by it.” Finally, his choice depended on a person’s willingness to accept the challenge of a “career case,” a case, as it were, that is never-ending, requiring two years to get to trial and a year or two to try it. The largest DA’s office in the US stretched across Los Angeles County from Antelope Valley in the north to Long Beach in the south, from Santa Monica in the west to Pomona in the east; and in the sleepy, sweltering Pomona branch, far from Hollywood, Webb found the individual to prosecute the Twilight Zone case. His candidate looked like a 40s movie character; of medium height and sturdy with slicked-down hair and tight-fitting dark suits, a gold chain and jaguar-like movements, Gary Kesselman was a tough New Yorker who had put himself through law school. He impressed Webb as someone who was his own man, not the kind who wanted to be “part of the crowd.” Webb had first met Kesselman sometime previously when he hurriedly needed a Spanish-speaking attorney with ties to the Hispanic community. The case involved a rare instance in which Mexico, which normally doesn’t extradite its nationals, agreed to make an exception in one particular situation. But it demanded that Webb at once dispatch someone to pick up this national in Guadalajara. In the nick of time Webb turned up Kesselman, a former Peace Corps member fluent in Spanish who caught a plane that same day. Kesselman again came to Webb’s notice in the little-known Danny Young case in Pomona, involving the grisly murder of a young boy by his neighbor. The case was extremely tough. Before Kesselman became its prosecutor, the earlier trial had resulted in a hung jury. Kesselman investigated personally every facet of the murder of little Danny Young; on weekends he spent his own time walking the neighborhood to find out who had seen what. “Kesselman was a bulldog,” Webb recalled. After retrying the case and avoiding the errors of his predecessors, Kesselman won Webb’s confidence by getting a conviction. As a fresh appointee to the TZ case in September 1982, Kesselman, with a powerful mandate to bring criminal charges, replaced Llorente as chief investigator. He first contacted Tom Budds in the sheriff ’s department. Then he asked Don Llorente for a screening of the film. Llorente courteously scheduled a showing in the Warner screening room which Kesselman attended with two lieutenants from the DA’s own Bureau of Investigation, William Burnett", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634243667_cleaned.txt:200:c3240392c16e", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 1804, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634243667_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634243667", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634243667_cleaned", "chunk_index": 201, "text": "predecessors, Kesselman won Webb’s confidence by getting a conviction.

Llorente courteously scheduled a showing in the Warner screening room which Kesselman attended with two lieutenants from the DA’s own Bureau of Investigation, William Burnett and Dave Berthiaume. It was the first time anyone from the DA’s office saw the film. In Warner’s screening room Gary Kesselman got his dramatic introduction to the case. After seeing it on a big screen he viewed the drama on the chem machine, a smaller machine used in editing which allows the operator to freeze-frame. He studied huts No. 4 and 5 frame-by-frame; inch-by-inch the fireballs unfolded and grew and enveloped the helicopter’s tail; the investigators went back over that scene again and again. Don Llorente with never-failing patience answered questions from Kesselman, Burnett and Berthiaume. John Silvia, Warner’s safety man, was there as a member of the NTSB team. He also told the select audience about what he had seen at the site and what he knew about the accident. The fresh screening of the fatal footage gave the studio its first indication that the district attorney was seriously focusing on the accident as a criminal case. The event was important enough for O’Melveny’s Bill Vaughn to communicate to Don Llorente on Warner’s behalf. Vaughn complained to Llorente that by letting the DA view the film without Warner’s prior consent he had come close to violating their agreement not to show the film to outsiders. Though Llorente respectfully apologized, he underscored his intention fully to cooperate with the DA’s office. Backing off, Vaughn only requested to be kept informed of further showings of the film. With the DA’s entry the sheer weight of the case now began to be felt by many who’d been involved in the film. Studio employees felt the pressure to keep quiet and not communicate with outsiders. One Warner employee spoke of pressures being placed upon him by the studio’s in-house lawyer, Stan Belkin. Other witnesses to the horror on the set were affected on a more personal level. They lived through sleepless nights plagued by nightmares. Some sought the help of psychiatrists. Others couldn’t work for weeks afterwards.

They had no idea of any of the details of the movie makers’ plan to use the children illegally. The bodies on the set constituted clear enough evidence that the children had been used without a permit. Yet, despite this incontrovertible fact, investigators faced a wall of silence from several key people who had been not so much instigators of the plan as accomplices; having been dragged into the scheme and stuck with it, right until the terrible end. Ironically, just as Charlie Hughes had problems with Andy House, so did Charlie’s partner Bob Chapman with House’s assistant, Hilary Leach. A cherubic, sandy-haired, smiling, casual, co-ed-type in her mid-twenties, Hilary, as part of her DGA training program, had been sent out for an interview with Andy House for a position on the TZ movie. After working on Tex, a Disney production starring Matt Dillon, the TZ movie was only her second feature film. Labor investigator Chapman was not at all surprised that during the interview she was “toe-dancing around,” but he also felt he couldn’t really blame her; as he put it, “You’re dealing with people like Spielberg and Landis.” She couldn’t talk. “Her whole career was here.” One of the young investigators, Dave Berthiaume, moonlighted from the DA’s office as a location manager in the film industry and through his Hollywood connections he got word to the TZ’s location manager Richard Vane that the district attorney wanted him to submit to an interview. But Vane never responded. Instead, he promptly called Warner’s Stan Belkin to warn the studio lawyer of the DA’s request. Following the studio’s confidential policy against cooperating with the DA’s investigation, Belkin advised Vane that he had no obligation to contact the DA’s office. He had the final choice to do whatever he thought was “appropriate,” Belkin counseled in confidential discussions with the witness. Vane’s course became clear within days of receiving this advice. He didn’t break the wall of silence. While avoiding the DA’s Berthiaume he secretly met with Warner’s own lawyers and denied that either he or Frank Marshall knew about the cover-up of the kids on the set. He told the studio’s lawyers much about the behind-the-scenes activities on the night of the crash. But protecting himself and Marshall, he minimized both their roles in the illegal hiring of the children and in the cover-up of what took place in the final scene. Following this highly confidential interview Vane would not figure in the Twilight Zone case again until the grand jury hearings some nine months later in June of ‘83.

Following this highly confidential interview Vane would not figure in the Twilight Zone case again until the grand jury hearings some nine months later in June of ‘83. Not totally forthcoming with Warner’s lawyers, he held back his role in the conspiracy to conceal the children from the fireman/welfare studio teacher on the set that night. His role in this scheme would not surface until the Grand Jury hearings nine months later. Richard Vane first teamed up with the Landis people on an aborted effort to film Into the Night. From September ^(𝔠)81 until February the following year he worked on the early development of Landis’ film noir until the financing fell through and the project remained on the shelf for the next two years. He first worked with Frank Marshall on E.T., and got to know him better on another Spielberg movie, Poltergeist. According to Allingham, it was Frank Marshall who recommended that he hire Vane as location manager for the TZ movie. The importance of Vane’s secret interview with Warner was that he provided an alibi for the film’s executive producer and, by extension, for Steven Spielberg. As a location manager, Vane’s duties involved scouting the areas to be filmed and making sure that the film company acted in accordance with the permits he had obtained. Vane privately told the Warner lawyers that neither he nor Marshall knew about the illegal use of the children in the fatal scene. At 2:20, when the cameras began rolling, Vane said that he and Frank Marshall watched the scene from the opposite side of the river and that, because of the conditions on the set and the late hour, they both assumed that dolls were being used instead of kids. According to confidential Warner memos, Vane said he only assumed that Marshall thought they were dolls; he did not recall any specific conversation with Marshall at the time regarding the use of children or dolls in the final scene. The Warner lawyers, after hearing Vane’s account, could now be satisfied that Marshall, and presumably Spielberg, the studio’s most important asset, did not know about the illegal hiring and the dangerous conditions on the set. Following Vane, one of the last of the critical witnesses to be debriefed by Warner’s counsel was Elie Cohn, who surprised the studio with a startling admission concerning the infamous “lower, lower” quote that haunted the case. In both his interviews with the labor investigators and with Budds and Finnigan, Cohn had stated that he did not recall whether Landis ordered the helicopter to come lower seconds before the crash. But confronted with the high-powered studio lawyers, he repeated the confession he had", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634243667_cleaned.txt:203:677f5784d859", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 1807, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634243667_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634243667", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634243667_cleaned", "chunk_index": 204, "text": "of the last of the critical witnesses to be debriefed by Warner’s counsel was Elie Cohn, who surprised the studio with a startling admission concerning the infamous “lower, lower” quote that haunted the case.

But confronted with the high-powered studio lawyers, he repeated the confession he had made only in private to the investigator working for the phalanx. He told the studio lawyers that although he was in general radio contact with Allingham up in the helicopter, he never had time to communicate with him before the helicopter crashed. According to confidential studio memos, Cohn said he saw Landis speaking through a bullhorn to the helicopter and that he heard him calling for the aircraft to come lower. Other parts of Cohn’s recollections tended to implicate some of Warner’s people. Cohn told the movie company lawyers that he had seen Lucy Fisher on the set two or three times, referring to her as the “executive in charge from Warner Bros.” Like all those from the set that night questioned by Warner, Cohn did not admit to any involvement at all in the hiring and use of the children. In an obvious attempt to protect those involved in the cover-up of the kids on the set he misled Warner’s men by telling them that it was only after the crash that he learned about the handling of the children from Andy House. On the legal front Warner followed Frank Marshall’s lead in focusing on the young lawyer-investigator from Cal/OSHA, Marilyn Levin. After learning in late October from Marshall’s attorneys that the DA’s office was not as yet contemplating criminal charges against Frank Marshall, Warner’s two top legal advisers set up their own meeting with Marilyn Levin. At this meeting, just as Marshall’s counsel had done earlier, Warner, albeit reluctantly, pointed the finger at Landis in order to minimize the studio’s involvement as employers. The O’Melveny lawyers, Vaughn and Dunham, tried to make their point to the Cal/OSHA investigator, just as Marshall’s lawyer Pollock had done, by explaining the facts of film making. They pointed out to Levin that Landis had final cut on his segment and that no one at Warner Bros., had seen the film’s dailies. The lawyers talked about call sheets and in explaining their importance made the most radical act of distancing Warner from the event at Indian Dunes. They impressed on Levin that these call sheets listing the presence of the children in the scene had not arrived until the day after the crash. Two days after the meeting with Warner’s top legal guns Levin received from them a thoughtful message, thanking her for her cooperation regarding the citations.

Shortly after, Cal/OSHA’s Levin made her official recommendation to Deputy District Attorney Gary Kesselman. The onslaught by Marshall’s and Warner’s powerful attorneys on the impressionable bureaucrat from Cal/OSHA had hit the mark. While her investigation recommended that the case was suitable for criminal prosecution, it mainly focused on the Landis group. At the same time, on another front, Warner vehemently opposed efforts by the NTSB to release the film showing the fatal crash scene to the media for general consumption. Unknown to the media, a relentless campaign was being directed in Los Angeles by O’Melveny’s Bill Vaughn. The Washington, D.C., office of O’Melveny & Myers figured largely in this effort. The NTSB’s general counsel in Washington was literally bombarded with letters and phone calls attempting to block release of the film. Vaughn based this opposition on the grounds that it could damage Warner’s economic interest. Vaughn wrote: … public exhibition of the scene which ends with the accident could substantially diminish public curiosity about the finished motion picture, and create a negative association in the minds of the general public (most of whom are potential moviegoers) with the finished picture itself. Warner and the other major motion picture studios spend substantial sums each year to prevent copyright infringement.… The only clips which are publicly exhibited are carefully chosen scenes from the finished motion pictures, intended to have a beneficial impact upon the viewing public. Three months after the crash the DGA came out of the closet and held a safety symposium. It was requested that because of the Twilight Zone crash neither non-members nor the press be present. The members were further asked not to comment to the press representatives outside. Such requests failed, however, to remove Mark Resnick, a recruit to the Landis phalanx from the giant LA law firm, Paul, Hastings, Janofsky and Walker. Resnick, a lawyer and not a DGA member, surreptitiously listened while movie director after movie director held the floor. He took notes which he afterwards sent to Joel Behr so Landis’ personal lawyer could see which director was most critical of his client and which would be most suitable as an expert witness for Landis’ defense. Present at this unusual convocation of DGA members were some of Hollywood’s most distinguished directors in television and motion pictures, such as Marvin Chomsky (noted for his TV films, Roots, Holocaust, Inside the Third Reich)’, famed actor and director, Jackie Cooper; Richard Brooks", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634243667_cleaned.txt:205:a3ec711680e6", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 1809, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634243667_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634243667", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634243667_cleaned", "chunk_index": 206, "text": "He took notes which he afterwards sent to Joel Behr so Landis’ personal lawyer could see which director was most critical of his client and which would be most suitable as an expert witness for Landis’ defense.

Other DGA members in attendance represented sections of the guild involving unit production managers and stunt coordinators, notably Terry Leonard, stunt coordinator on Spielberg’s 1941 as well as on Coppola’s Apocalypse Now, and Max Pleven, stunt coordinator for Rollerball and Silver Streak. In his report to Behr, Resnick singled out director Richard Brooks;”by far the day’s most vocal and temperamental speaker.” Over the years Richard Brooks was to become one of John Landis’ most strident DGA critics. In addition to bringing Vic Morrow to Hollywood for his starring role in Blackboard Jungle, Richard Brooks had done one of the most famous stunt scenes while making Elmer Gantry in 1956. For the scene involving the interior burning of a church Brooks had 40 firemen present and 200 stunt people, as well as 800 extras bussed into the set for the mob scene. Even with all of the elaborate preparations, the director almost had an accident when the heat became so intense that the movie’s female star, Jean Simmons, fainted as the fire unexpectedly consumed all of the available oxygen. Resnick’s memo to Joel Behr noted that while Brooks was angry that because of the Twilight Zone crash all directors were catching hell, he also criticized the studios for putting time pressures on directors to get the film done. The memo made note of Jackie Cooper, the Hollywood fixture since his child-acting days who was to become active in DGA safety matters. Behr’s secret agent described Cooper as having urged members not to make any open references to the incident on the set to outsiders. The meeting ended on the note that self-policing was necessary in order to avoid legislative intervention. Cooper vehemently opposed the idea of safety marshals because he felt it would hurt the creative side of film making. “An omniscient son-of-a-bitch from Sacramento will ruin this business,” Jackie Cooper told the gathering. The DGA tried to dissociate itself from the case to “protect the legal process.” But even so, intense pressure built within the guild to take action against those who broke DGA rules on hiring the children.

Nowhere in the guild was this feeling stronger than in a little-known internal committee, the AD/UPM Council, consisting of assistant directors (AD’s) and unit production managers (UPM’s). It was within this small unit that the Landis cover-up first came apart as the council dealt with a surprise from a 2nd AD who wanted to talk about his involvement in the illegal hiring. Long before the investigators unearthed the truth, the AD/UPM Council learned from Andy House what had actually happened on the set that fatal night. Anderson House had become the weak link in the chain which for a year had held firm against cooperating with the authorities. In an unprecedented AD/UPM council session, a small group of DGA members saw House weep and heard his confession and strange plea. His appearance was that of a broken man, nervous, sometimes in tears. It was not coincidental that the haggard man took his strange plea to the forum of his colleagues just before the TZ movie’s ‘83 summer release. Andy House came to the session to avail himself of a little-used part of the DGA contract with the studios that entitled members to see a copy of the “main” (opening) and the “end” (closing) titles before a film’s release. House addressed the council’s closed meeting with the unusual request to For obvious reasons the DGA was disinclined to grant the name Alan Smithee. As one DGA member who was present at the closed session with Andy House put it, “If you bask in the sunshine of your glories you should also wallow in the mud of your mistakes.” In order to obtain the Alan Smithee alias, the film maker really had to prove that his work had been “perverted,” and Andy House put himself through a wrenching confession before the small body of his fellows gathered at DGA headquarters on Sunset Boulevard. The DA’s office had no inkling at that time of the struggles, internal and external, embroiling the phalanx, Warner, the DGA, the Spielberg organization and Twilight Zone Productions. The DA’s investigators played outsider to the insider world of Hollywood, excluded even from the rumors always rife within the super-secretive film business. Without benefit of Andy House’s confession to the DGA committee, or the results of Warner’s internal debriefings, Tom Budds’ investigation remained in the fog.

For all intents and purposes the DA’s investigation by the spring of ‘83 had ground to a halt. The new prosecutor Gary Kesselman, still uncertain as to whether or not the DA’s office had enough evidence to charge any of the movie people involved with criminal conduct, finally met with the chairman of the grand jury’s criminal complaints committee. Kessselman believed that only through sworn testimony before a grand jury could headway be made against the conflicting versions about the crash given by witnesses to investigators from federal, state and local agencies. Meanwhile, the DA’s office let it be known that it would offer immunity to key witnesses in return for full disclosure about the events that night. But even with the awesome grand jury powers, the mystery might well have remained forever stalled if it had not been for an accidental meeting between Gary Kesselman and Donna Schuman that broke one portion of the case wide open. From the labor commissioner’s files Kesselman had picked out Dr. Hal Schuman’s name and set up an interview for May 11, 1983. Basically, Kesselman knew little from the files about Dr. Schuman other than that the psychiatrist was peripherally involved in the child-hiring scheme in connection with George Folsey Jr. But at Schuman’s Hollywood home he met the psychiatrist’s wife. For all of the preceding ten months, like others in the case, Donna Schuman had not volunteered information. Perhaps it was the period of moral gestation: responsibility brought to term. In talking to Kesselman, Donna Schuman went even farther than Andy House did before the guild committee when he pleaded for the name Alan Smithee. That evening Donna Schuman gave the investigation its first inside look into the Landis operation. She supplied Kesselman with names, dates, and addresses of vital witnesses to the disaster. She identified key staffers in the operation who knew about the plan to hire the kids and took part in the cover-up on the set. Primarily, she supplied him with the names of the two witnesses who, besides herself, made the grand jury indictments possible. From Donna Schuman, Kesselman for the first time learned how Anderson House was involved in the elaborate cover-up to prevent fireman/ studio teacher Jack Tice from seeing the kids at night. Schuman also led him to Cynthia Nigh, Dan Allingham’s former girlfriend. From Cynthia Nigh the prosecutor learned that Landis and Folsey actually had foreknowledge of the possible legal consequences if they used the kids. Nigh told Kesselman that the director and his business partner had actually discussed the subject of going to jail if their illegal", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634243667_cleaned.txt:208:94cf590c4514", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 1812, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634243667_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634243667", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634243667_cleaned", "chunk_index": 209, "text": "time learned how Anderson House was involved in the elaborate cover-up to prevent fireman/ studio teacher Jack Tice from seeing the kids at night.

Nigh told Kesselman that the director and his business partner had actually discussed the subject of going to jail if their illegal actions became known to authorities. A week following the partial breakthrough with Donna Schuman on May 19, Kesselman and Tom Budds met with Andy House in the office of House’s attorney, John Dellaverson. As the two sides faced each other the situation was unlike Budds’ first meeting with House nine months earlier. This time the investigators laid out their knowledge of his deep involvement in the plan and the cover-up. Dellaverson and Kesselman agreed on a sort of “informal immunity” for the 2nd AD, that is, if he cooperated with the grand jury and told all he knew he would not be a target. Dellaverson made the same arrangement for House’s assistant the night of the crash; unlike her meeting with labor investigator Bob Chapman, nine months earlier, Hilary Leach would now tell her part of the story to the investigators and repeat it a week later to the newly-convened grand jury. On the eve of their indictment, Landis, Folsey and Allingham wereunaware that the links in the chain of silence had already irrepainvolving Donna Schuman were out of range of the phalanx. In Century City, Joel Behr and his criminal advisor Harland Braun still focused on the bullhorn because of its connection with the “lower, lower” issue. The strategy they formulated included cooperating with the grand jury. Landis, Folsey and Allingham would testify in the hope that they could avoid indictment and at the same time have a grandstand, as it were, from which to point the finger at others, namely, the helicopter pilot and the special effects crew, particularly Paul Stewart. In line with this strategy the phalanx sought out people who could bring testimony before the grand jury that would support Landis’ side of the story. It meant finding “friendly” witnesses willing to go to bat for the director before the extraordinary body of 21 no-nonsense citizens. At Behr’s suggestion Harland Braun met with two of these friendly witnesses. One was the veteran propman from many Landis movies who would help corroborate that the director was not screaming “lower, lower” through his bullhorn at the time of the crash.

One was the veteran propman from many Landis movies who would help corroborate that the director was not screaming “lower, lower” through his bullhorn at the time of the crash. His duties included handling the bullhorn and the director’s chair; moreover, he had definitely pointed the finger of responsibility at the powdermen, secretly informing Landis’ private investigators that he saw both Paul Stewart and Jerry Williams at impromptu parties on the special effects truck when beer was being consumed just before the crash (“They didn’t go to the lunch line and have a meal with the rest of us. They stayed back, hung in their truck and drank beer.”) He also accused Paul Stewart of using crude equipment and of appearing intoxicated with “bloodshot eyes” during the filming of the final shot. This friendly witness, Mike Milgrom, was willing to swear that Landis did not even have a bullhorn. He’d already talked with representatives of the phalanx and was thought to make a creditable appearance. The other friendly witness who was thought to be valuable in shoring up Landis’ case before the grand jury was a Vietnam War veteran with casual good looks named Paul Hensler. Hensler had worked as technical adviser on several Vietnam War scenes in films that included Apocalypse Now and The Deer Hunter, as well as The Exterminator on which Paul Stewart had been chief special effects coordinator. Reading about Paul Stewart’s involvement in the Twilight Zone crash, Hensler contacted Landis’ attorneys and informed them that he was not surprised that an accident had occurred. Disregarding the fact that, ironically, the special effects in The Exterminator was what had originally recommended Stewart to Landis, a meeting was arranged with Hensler. It took place at the Moustache Cafe in Westwood. Hensler elaborated to Harland Braun and Joel Behr’s assistant, John Diemer, on some dangerous incidents during The Exterminator filming for which he blamed Paul Stewart. In the shooting of one SFX scene, Hensler said, he was up in the helicopter while Stewart set off a land mortar directly underneath the aircraft, causing it to lose substantial altitude so that it came close to crashing. Hensler also mentioned three actors in The Exterminator who received minor burns when Stewart set off an explosion in their close proximity. In yet another incident Hensler blamed Stewart for exploding a water mortar while a stuntman stood directly over it. Stating his belief that Stewart drank while working, the Vietnam vet with the strong antipathy against Stewart would make an altogether favorable grand jury witness. Dividing their time, Behr and his assistant Diemer interviewed potentially friendly witnesses like Robert Liddle, the stand-in, who was willing to state under oath that Landis had nothing to do with ordering the helicopter to come lower.

Another possible consideration as a friendly witness, James Glickenhaus, the director of The Exterminator, was assigned to Landis’ private investigator Robert Frasco. Frasco returned from this interview again with bad news. The confidential account Glickenhaus gave of the detailed planning that went into The Exterminator, particularly into the dramatic helicopter and fire sequence, made sharp contrast with the haphazard and uncontrolled conditions on the TZ set: Glickenhaus was not asked to help out. As the result of the grand jury proceedings Behr, on Braun’s advice, hired separate criminal counsel for Folsey and Allingham, respectively. For Folsey it was Roger Rosen, another Century City criminal attorney; and for Allingham it was Leonard Levine who would remain Allingham’s attorney throughout the trial. The attorneys could have kept their clients from testifying by letting them take the Fifth Amendment, except that it would have guaranteed an indictment – precisely what everyone wished to avoid. The best alternative seemed to be that John Landis, briefed, prepared, behaviorally modified, in conjunction with “friendly” witnesses, could perhaps defuse the criminal character of the case and thus get himself and the others off the hook. The grand jury proceedings that opened nearly a year after the crash, on May 31, 1983, were held in the grand jury room on the 13th floor of the Criminal Court building in downtown LA. In the two-week sitting more than two-score witnesses, apart from Landis, Folsey and Allingham, were interrogated by Gary Kesselman, who conducted the proceedings. On the first day of the grand jury the most damaging witnesses in the entire case appeared: Donna Schuman and Andy House, the Le and Chen parents, fireman/studio teacher Jack Tice, and the driver of the Chapman crane who on the final night of shooting had heard himself yelled at by John Landis for being a “fucking idiot.” Unknown to either Landis or his phalanx, the Chapman driver brought to the grand jury room a series of slides of photographs he had taken the night of the crash, one of which would wreak havoc with a pet premise of the defense planned by Landis’ attorneys. The grand jurors heard from Donna Schuman about the script problems, how Folsey told her “John” had written some kids into the script and how, ultimately, they had managed to find the kids. She related conversations she heard about hiring the kids illegally and how she helped in the scheme without realizing that the kids, copter and explosives would all be used together.

She related conversations she heard about hiring the kids illegally and how she helped in the scheme without realizing that the kids, copter and explosives would all be used together. Donna Schuman’s account was amplified by Andy House. The 2nd AD described his fruitless attempts to warn Allingham and even the director himself after learning that children would be used in connection with explosives and a helicopter and that the shooting would be – he explained the term – “night for night.” He stated how he urged Allingham in vain to get the director to look at professional little people, or else use dolls or dummies. He mentioned his discovery of Jack Tice at Indian Dunes, and did not spare his own role in widening the conspiracy by going to others on the set and warning them of Tice. House related an incident he had witnessed just before the final scene when, while standing in the river, he heard the director ask Stewart to place a mortar under one of the shoreline huts closest to the action. House told the grand jurors that after Stewart declined, saying it was too close to the helicopter, “Landis became very upset” but then “immediately cooled down.” 9:30 and that when she cried John Landis picked up the little girl to comfort her. George Folsey Jr. put his arm around Mrs. Chen, according to the interpreter, assuring her that it wasn’t dangerous. Renee’s mother told of Hilary Leach escorting them from the director’s trailer to the set. The interpreter translated Folsey’s strange warning to Mrs. Chen. “If a fireman questions you, just say that you are helping, you are a friend of mine and you are helping out. Don’t say anything about the money or the children being paid money.” Shyan-Hei Chen identified photos of Landis and Folsey in People’s Exhibit 4 and 5. Next, Jack Tice came before the grand jury with impressive credentials of having been a studio teacher on over 250 films and having done extensive work with helicopters, especially in their most dangerous hovering position. He recalled his discovery of the boy’s decapitated head bobbing in the shallow water near the nose of the fallen craft and how he had held it between his feet until somebody came with a black garbage bag. He said he later discovered the girl, Renee, lying dead on the bank 30 feet from the helicopter. Tice mentioned the suspicions that afterwards dawned on him, saying he “thought it was quite unusual” that of the six firemen present on the set, the location manager, Dick Vane, would ask only", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634243667_cleaned.txt:212:15071b983c41", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 1816, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634243667_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634243667", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634243667_cleaned", "chunk_index": 213, "text": "bobbing in the shallow water near the nose of the fallen craft and how he had held it between his feet until somebody came with a black garbage bag.

She informed the grand jurors of the California labor code which made both under-16 employment after 10P.M . as well as hazardous or dangerous employment conditions illegal. Colleen Logan was followed by another thirty-or-so witnesses. Grimfaced, serious, Warner’s VP Edward Morey focused the blame on Landis; describing the Landis operation as independent of Warner Bros., he informed the grand jurors that Frank Marshall simply lent his name to the production, doing nothing more than representing Steven Spielberg. Cynthia Nigh said damning stuff about getting the cash to pay the kids, the meetings behind closed doors, Folsey’s joke (“We’ll probably be thrown in jail after this, just because of the kids”), and how she heard Folsey tell Renee’s mother over the phone “that it was just like fireworks” and she needn’t be afraid. Kathryn Wooten complained about the lack of pre-production meetings with crew, director and producer. The grand jurors heard Hilary Leach corroborate Andy House about wanting to use little professional people for the “stunt” in the explosion scene. Even the so-called friendly witnesses that had been prepared under Joel Behr’s supervision couldn’t avoid damaging the director’s image in front of the grand jurors. Elie Cohn stated to the panel that Landis told him they had to be careful not to be caught once the studio teacher had been recognized on the set. Set designer Richard Sawyer recalled that the odor of gasoline on the set at the time was “overpowering, beyond belief.” Neither were the special effects men helpful in their appearances.

Before the citizens in the secret grand jury room passed the parade of powdermen. All except the chief, Paul Stewart, had been given immunity. Paul Stewart did not testify; instead, his NTSB statement was read into the grand jury record. In addition, the grand jury heard indirect testimony on Stewart from Deputy Sheriff Budds, who repeated statements Stewart made to him in two police interviews. And so it went before the impassive panel of 21 silent citizens. Witness after witness dealt blow upon blow to the carefully laid defense of bouffant-crested Behr, acerbic Braun and eager Diemer. Makeup artist Melanie Levitt and master shot Steve Lydecker told of the live ammo on the set and hearing Landis’ “lower, lower” screamed through a megaphone. One of the most damaging exchanges took place between Kesselman and Roland Chiniquy, an SFX hand for forty years, five of which as head of special effects at Universal Studios. Although he was not involved in the TZ production, Chiniquy was a veteran noted for SFX on such films as Airport, Jaws and Earthquake, for which he won one Academy Award, and for Hindenburg, for which he won another. He elaborated in detail on all the standard preparations that had to be made for a scene of the kind that brought down the helicopter that night. Kesselman asked Chiniquy what he would have done if a director had ordered him to be involved with a helicopter hovering in general proximity to the children, knowing that explosives were going to be detonated in their general area. “I probably would have been fired,” Chiniquy said, “because I wouldn’t do it.” Following advice from Warner’s counsel, Vane had maintained the wall of silence by not cooperating with the DA. In subsequent private talks with Warner, the film studio had been relieved to learn from him that neither he nor Frank Marshall knew about the kids on the set. The studio memo which recorded this interview noted at the time that Vane had assumed that Marshall thought they were going to use dolls, since he was unable to recall any specific exchanges with Marshall on the subject of kids and dolls in the final scene. But under the grand jury subpoena, Vane was able to recollect that when the action for the final shot began Marshall had concretely verbalized to him his belief that there were actually dolls under Vic’s arms.

As the secret hearings proceeded, Joel Behr directed Harland Braun and John Diemer to attend an important meeting with John Landis on June 12, a Sunday, two days before Landis’ grand jury testimony. They met at the director’s home on Lloyd Crest in Beverly Hills. His wife Deborah was there with his daughter Rachel. The Landis home was inwardly dominated by a primate motif. Braun and Diemer, while briefing the director in the living room, faced a huge stuffed gorilla standing guard at the door. It was so lifelike it was eerie. In the den library were stacks of movie books, a lot of them about gorillas. The den was loaded with electronic gizmos and videos; a huge TV faced another giant portrait of a gorilla that hung on the wall. Pictures and books on werewolves abounded. A few weeks before, after attending a 50th anniversary screening of King Kong at Mann’s Chinese, Landis paid $8, 500 for special effects expert Harry Hansen’s giant Kong statue to add to his collection. The stuffed gorilla at the door was a wedding gift from Academy Award winner and close friend Rick Baker. The home reflected the Landis personality. While Behr and Diemer passed around memos and newspaper articles or tried to engage Landis’ attention for his upcoming testimony there were digressions to admire the bearded director’s huge collection of miniature toys, especially his collection of old-fashioned lead cars displayed on shelves in the den. In spite of his troubles during that spring of ‘83 John Landis was preoccupied with film projects. “Landis is up and happy,” reported Dan Aykroyd who had gone on after the TZ movie to star with Eddie Murphy in Trading Places, which was about to open. Like Spielberg, Landis was making movies for all the major studios: Trading Places for Paramount, Twilight Zone for Warner, and for Universal’s Pay TV and Home Video Division he put together his first video, a compilation of classic and modern horror movie trailers, Coming Soon, hosted by Jamie Lee Curtis. By the time of the meeting in his home, the limits on Landis’ testimony had already been agreed upon in discussions Braun had earlier with Gary Kesselman. Through his attorney Landis had already agreed that he would testify on all matters pertaining to the accident on the set that night except to questions specifically related to the hiring of the children, based on the", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634243667_cleaned.txt:215:16d93ad5780a", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 1819, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634243667_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634243667", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634243667_cleaned", "chunk_index": 216, "text": "a compilation of classic and modern horror movie trailers, Coming Soon, hosted by Jamie Lee Curtis.

Through his attorney Landis had already agreed that he would testify on all matters pertaining to the accident on the set that night except to questions specifically related to the hiring of the children, based on the Fifth Amendment principle against self-incrimination. One day following the top-level Sunday meeting at Landis’ home on Lloyd Crest, Folsey and Allingham appeared in the secret sanctum on the 13th floor of the Criminal Court building. It was the next-to-last day of proceedings; the only other witness yet to appear, John Landis, was scheduled for the next morning. In Allingham’s afternoon appearance the grand jurors met for the first time the smallest wheel of the troika on the set that night. But by the time he presented his incredible story to the grand jury the panel had already obtained from Donna Schuman, Andy House and Cynthia Nigh the portrait of an obedient UPM who without hesitation, with some bullying, in fact, labored to implement the illegal hiring plan, dismissing the numerous pleas from Andy House and setting in motion the cover-up to avoid detection. Allingham casually told the jury that after the near-fatal 11:30 rage scene he never attempted to communicate the danger to John Landis: at the time he felt the explosions were not dangerous and that all he had heard from the crew was, “It’s a little warm up here.” He couldn’t recall whether he ever discussed with Landis the use of alternatives for the children. “It’s been over a year,” he said, but even if it had been discussed he knew that such a proposal was unfeasible because of the type of photography they were doing and the box-office aspect. “There was just no way,” he explained, “that you could put a midget in there that would, I guess, sell.” Deputy DA Gary Kesselman focused on his part in hiring the helicopter pilot. Had Allingham looked into the qualifications of the pilot? Had he simply hired him because he was cheapest? Or because he would be the most compliant in cooperating with the director’s dangerous climactic scene? Why had he hired Dorcey Wingo who had no experience with fireballs when also interviewed for the job were hugely experienced people like John Gamble and Hollywood professionals like Clay Wright, both of whom had already appeared as grand jury witnesses? Clay Wright, Allingham said, was “too flakey.” Of Gamble, who’d met with him at the Universal bungalow, Allingham simply said, “the name doesn’t ring a bell with me.” When George Folsey Jr. took the stand Kesselman informed the grand jurors, as he previously had done with regard to Allingham, that", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634243667_cleaned.txt:216:690cf617fc8d", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 1820, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634243667_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634243667", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634243667_cleaned", "chunk_index": 217, "text": "fireballs when also interviewed for the job were hugely experienced people like John Gamble and Hollywood professionals like Clay Wright, both of whom had already appeared as grand jury witnesses? Clay Wright, Allingham said, was “too flakey.” Of Gamble, who’d met with him at the Universal bungalow, Allingham simply said, “the name doesn’t ring a bell with me.” When George Folsey Jr. took the stand Kesselman informed the grand jurors, as he previously had done with regard to Allingham, that the interrogation could not touch on the hiring of the children, nor on the topic of the licenses or permits related to their employment. During the interrogation George Folsey made his presence on the set that night appear to be a casual visit. In the fateful scene, Folsey testified, his chief concern was that the rough river bottom might cause trouble for Vic’s crossing while carrying the children. He told the grand jurors that he hadn’t heard anyone suggest it might be unsafe to have the children near explosives. But as in Allingham’s case, the grand jury already knew in detail the extent of Folsey’s role through earlier testimony it had heard. Folsey told the grand jurors that he had gone to the set because it was the last night of shooting and wanted to see “if everything was all right,” minimizing his role as “just an extra pair of eyes and ears” in case anybody had a question to ask him. He denied having expressed fright at the 11:30 shot, in contrast to Cynthia Nigh’s testimony of his remark to her during the stupendous blasts about being relieved that his wife and children had not come to the set. Folsey could not be questioned about Myca and Renee; the grand jurors, however, had already heard from Cynthia Nigh of his joking, “We could all go to jail for this,” and that around the office it was common knowledge that the children would be employed unlawfully. Wingo, like Paul Stewart, did not appear before the grand jury but instead had his NTSB testimony put into the record. Allingham and Folsey testified for two hours that Monday afternoon. When they were done the grand jury adjourned and bussed over to the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Science building in Beverly Hills. In one of the darkened screening rooms in which Academy members meet to appraise candidates for the Oscar the jurors watched rough cuts of three sequences; the rage sequence at 11:30, the “rehearsal” at 2:00, and the fatal scene at 2:20. The failure of the DA to discover the fourth sequence that would become prominent in the trial nearly three years later, the rescue sequence at 9:30, had less to do with the wall of silence they faced and more with the ineptitude of the investigators. The grand jury saw the crash scene from six different camera angles and", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634243667_cleaned.txt:217:7526704fcdf3", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 1821, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634243667_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634243667", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634243667_cleaned", "chunk_index": 218, "text": "jurors watched rough cuts of three sequences; the rage sequence at 11:30, the “rehearsal” at 2:00, and the fatal scene at 2:20.

The grand jury saw the crash scene from six different camera angles and at the end the foreman asked whether they wanted to see the sequence again. The silence of the panel of men and women indicated that they had seen enough. he legal practice which allowed the phalanx to “proffer” the grand jury witnesses friendly to John Landis stemmed from a 1978 California Supreme Court decision, Johnson vs. Superior Court. This made it obligatory for the DA to present to the grand jury any evidence which a potential defendant felt might be exculpatory. Thus Behr “proffered” Paul Hensler, the war movie expert, and Mike Milgrom, Landis’ propman, to appear among the 40-odd witnesses who were called before the grand jury. The purpose of these two special witnesses was to support the Landis defense on two key points. Hensler’s negative feelings about Paul Stewart from his experience with the explosives chief on The Exterminator, Behr hoped, would back up Landis’ contention that the director had no responsibility and, by stressing reliance on others, point the finger at the powdermen. Milgrom would say that John Landis never even had a bullhorn in the fatal scene and thus silence the haunting infamy, “lower, lower, lower.” As is customary, the DA’s prosecutor, Gary Kesselman, had been provided Hensler’s name by Landis’ attorneys. Kesselman realized that Hensler’s appearance before the grand jury was designed to place the blame on the powdermen. But he was also aware that in the chain of command the special effects chief took orders from the director and that he would not do anything with explosives without the director’s close involvement. And so, in a telephone conversation with Hensler, the prosecutor used a clever ploy and outflanked Landis’ costly phalanx. He devised a “hypothetical” question that was actually a description of the Landis set at Indian Dunes in the final scene. This telephone conversation took place a week prior to the time Hensler was sworn in as a grand jury witness. In the grand jury room Kesselman, continuing to probe in the “hypothetical” vein, described a set on which there was a lack of coordination between the pilot and the SFX chief, and the grand jurors heard Hensler react strongly that under these conditions he would not let the children onto the set. With these statements Hensler nullified anything exculpatory he had to say about John Landis, and made it seem even worse for the director since he was supposed to be friendly.", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634243667_cleaned.txt:218:3a7393e47047", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 1822, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634243667_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634243667", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634243667_cleaned", "chunk_index": 219, "text": "grand jury room Kesselman, continuing to probe in the “hypothetical” vein, described a set on which there was a lack of coordination between the pilot and the SFX chief, and the grand jurors heard Hensler react strongly that under these conditions he would not let the children onto the set. With these statements Hensler nullified anything exculpatory he had to say about John Landis, and made it seem even worse for the director since he was supposed to be friendly. And what was true of Hensler was true to an even more devastating degree in the fiasco of propman Mike Milgrom. Milgrom’s testimony completely shattered Landis’ credibility. In accordance with the custom, Harland Braun had provided the prosecutor with a list of questions that Landis wished to be asked of the friendly witness. Since the phalanx “proffered” Milgrom to deny the bullhorn, Braun included in the list of questions many references to this instrument and its connection with the “lower, lower” issue. But by the time Milgrom appeared before the silent grand jurors and Kesselman read him the questions, the propman’s position was already undermined by previous witnesses, a total of six, who had testified that they witnessed the director yell “lower, lower” through the bullhorn. To a bewildered grand jury Milgrom alone protested, “Absolutely not!” Milgrom testified that Landis couldn’t have been yelling through the bullhorn. He swore he saw the bullhorn on the director’s chair. Kesselman had in his list of exhibits a photograph obtained from a series taken just before the crash. The photograph came from Kenny Williams, the Chapman crane operator that night who had been sworn at by Landis for being a “fucking idiot.” Williams had brought his camera to the set to capture the sensational fireballs promised in the final shooting. One of Williams’ slides was taken just seconds before the helicopter plunged. Marked Exhibit No. 35, the photograph showed a scene that was not captured by any of the six cameras filming the shot. It showed John Landis on the spit of land, with Milgrom standing next to him on one side and SFX man Jerry Williams on the other. In the end the Milgrom fiasco was for the grand jurors not so much a determining factor of Landis’ guilt or innocence as much as a test of his credibility.

Consequently, Landis’ personal appearance was important not for what he might say in his own defense but in determining whether he would take personal responsibility for all the conditions the jurors had heard described. As previously he had done with the friendly witnesses, Braun gave Kesselman a list of questions to ask John Landis – about 25 in all. Their twin thrust was to lend support to the defense argument that the Twilight Zone crash was an industrial accident and to establish the point that the director relies on others. Though well-rehearsed by his high-priced attorneys, Landis faced a bulldog who with “hypothetical” questioning snapped at the witness, then lunged for the kill. Kesselman listened to the director give an example of his reliance on experts with a smug analogy. ”When you get into a taxi,” he heard Landis assert, “you assume the driver is not going to drive you off a bridge. It’s just assumptions, the guy is a licensed taxi driver. These are experts.” Frequently Landis contradicted the testimony already on record of not one but two or three and even more witnesses. When asked specifically what preparations he had made after the 11:30 scene, Landis replied, “At the 11:30 shooting I was not surprised. I was watching Vic. And the explosions in the water were what I expected. However, Dorcey and Allingham came up to me, and said, ‘My God, these explosions were big. And we could feel the heat in the helicopter.’ And then I said, ‘Fine. Well, then let’s get away from them and put the helicopter over the water!”’ Here he contradicted not only Allingham, who had already testified that he never communicated to Landis about this particular incident, (only “It’s a little warm up here”), but also Wingo, whose NTSB statements, already in the grand jury record, included Wingo’s report of Landis’ response to his complaints about the just-completed rage scene. “Don’t be squeamish,” and “You ain’t seen nothing yet.” Landis tried to avoid saying that he wasn’t involved in the fatal shot’s planning. At the same time, he wanted to get across the idea that he, as director, had no responsibility. But keeping these two strands separate proved impossible and drew attention to his strange confusion. He recalled nothing definite about what he had told the powder chief about the placement of the bombs. “The explosions on the shore, I honestly don’t know how specific – if I was saying, ‘Put one there.”’ Nor could he recall if before the 2:20 crash he had set up a meeting between the SFX coordinator and the pilot in order to discuss their tasks in the upcoming crucial scene. Smugly he countered, referring to", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634243667_cleaned.txt:220:0da7d985c6ba", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 1824, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634243667_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634243667", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634243667_cleaned", "chunk_index": 221, "text": "attention to his strange confusion.

Smugly he countered, referring to the pilot, “Did I take him by the hand to Paul?” No, he couldn’t say whether the three of them together had discussed that, admitting that there was never a meeting with the entire crew, “only department heads.” One of the most heated exchanges between Landis and Kesselman took place over the issue of final authority on the set. After much wrangling Kesselman asked, “The final authority in terms of camera, actor, positions, helicopter, or whatsoever, on that set–” But before he could finish, Landis interrupted, ”is not mine, sir, because if I ask an actor, ‘Would you please take your hand and stick it in this garbage disposal?’ the actor is going to say, ‘Of course not.’” He denied having had a discussion that night with Paul Stewart in which he requested explosives be placed inside the huts. Addressing the “lower, lower” controversy, he denied that he even saw the helicopter near the end; he was signaling to Vic and not for the helicopter to come lower. He denied that the village was to be blown up at 2:20. When Kesselman asked whether anyone told him at any time prior to the filming that it was unsafe to have children in proximity to explosives, the answer was a vehement, “Absolutely not!” And when Kesselman persisted whether anyone suggested that stunt doubles be used, Landis bristled. “After reviewing the entire testimony,” Kesselman began, “and the notes that I have, on behalf of the district attorney’s office at this time, I am requesting that this grand jury bring back indictments against five individuals for involuntary manslaughter. And those five individuals are John Landis, George Folsey Jr., Dan Allingham, Dorcey Wingo, and Paul Stewart.” Kesselman explained that involuntary manslaughter can be based upon one of two legal principles. “The first is a death which occurs as a result of the commission of an unlawful act, not amounting to a felony: i.e., a misdemeanor, which is inherently dangerous.” He mentioned in this connection the violation of another penal code section, child endangerment, meant, Kesselman said, “basically is a person who has care, custody, or control of a minor, who permits that minor to be placed in a situation where the person or health of the minor is endangered.” Apart from the commission of the unlawful act, the child-hiring and endangering of a minor, Kesselman mentioned the second legal basis for involuntary manslaughter, “and", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634243667_cleaned.txt:221:b0bc3a4788ad", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 1825, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634243667_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634243667", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634243667_cleaned", "chunk_index": 222, "text": "misdemeanor, which is inherently dangerous.” He mentioned in this connection the violation of another penal code section, child endangerment, meant, Kesselman said, “basically is a person who has care, custody, or control of a minor, who permits that minor to be placed in a situation where the person or health of the minor is endangered.” Apart from the commission of the unlawful act, the child-hiring and endangering of a minor, Kesselman mentioned the second legal basis for involuntary manslaughter, “and that is the commission of a lawful act, but an act which involves a high degree of risk of death or great bodily injury which is done without due caution and circumspection.” The prosecutor asked the grand jurors to bring back an indictment against Landis on all five counts, two counts each for the children and on one count for Morrow. Kesselman sought indictments for Stewart and Wingo on three counts each, based on the lawful act “without due caution and circumspection.” Folsey and Allingham were asked to be indicted on counts 2 and 4, the unlawful act of hiring Myca and Renee and placing them in danger that resulted in their deaths. Kesselman in closing dwelt on two points, the children and the responsibility of the director. “Now, maybe Vic Morrow had a choice,” he argued, “if he knew what was coming. But those children didn’t. Those children didn’t by choice, by informed choice, choose to be there. And, I submit to you, neither did their parents.” And as to the question of who had the final authority, Kesselman ended dramatically: he next morning Gary Kesselman called to inform Harland Braun T of the grand jury decision. Braun took it badly, as he did every defeat, but it also stimulated his combativeness. He immediately informed Joel Behr. They agreed to meet and together take the long drive from Century City to Universal Studios. As they drove, Braun sensed in Behr a fear of telling Landis the bad news and, after shuffling into their client’s office, the two lawyers, for once, had little to say. They were themselves unnerved, still uncertain as to the cause of the debacle and highly interested in looking at the secret grand jury transcripts which were not due out for several weeks. The director called Folsey into the office. Behr related the bad news. Landis said, “Oh, shit!” Braun recalls. John Landis’ thick beard had been erased for a trimmer, much neater version. His hair, though still longish, was sleekly cut. The massive bifocals no longer seemed surrounded by shaggy growths. He dressed in suit and tie for rendezvous with the authorities.

As the result of the criminal indictments the criminal specialist, Harland Braun, became more prominent in the case. Joel Behr was a Hollywood lawyer in the classic deal-making tradition but out of his element in the arcane world of the criminal court. Although he remained the master-mind, tactician of the bulldozer defense, much of the work was now shifted to Braun who explained the tedious legal process: Landis, Folsey, Allingham, Stewart and Wingo were scheduled to appear in a week’s time for arraignment. They would be booked and have their mug shots taken. By agreement with the DA’s office, they were to be released on their own recognizance. That third week of June 1983 must have been a strange week for John Landis. The Los Angeles Times carried a banner headline, “Twilight Zone Indictments, Director, Two Others Charged in Film Deaths.” At the same time, it was also a week of wild success. The arraignment of the Twilight Zone defendants on June 24, 1983, ironically took place on the same day Warner released the TZ movie in theaters across the country. Trading Places was not only drawing crowds but received respectable praise from Vincent Canby, the New York Times film critic, who called it “the funniest American comedy of the year to date.” Canby wrote that in contrast to Animal House and Blues Brothers it showed that John Landis was capable of directing a comedy “of precise style as well as those that are accumulations of gargantuan often messy effects.” That morning the five defendants accompanied by their lawyers, struggled through a crush of reporters in the Criminal Court building. Ordinarily, booking is done in a police station, but the Hollywood party went up to an area on the 16th floor set aside for VIPs. After being finger-printed and having their mug shots taken, they made their way to Department 100 where a near riot broke out when reporters tried to get close to the director. Trading Places stars Ralph Bellamy and Don Ameche, the movie’s “Duke brothers,” present at the request of Landis’ attorneys, helped make the arraignment a Hollywood event. The mob streamed into the courtroom where they heard Judge Ronald M. George inform the defendants that as a result of the grand jury finding a “true bill,” Landis, Folsey, Allingham, Wingo and Stewart were indicted on multiple counts and would be booked under Case A391583. It was the first time Dorcey Wingo had seen or heard from the other film makers since the morning of the crash.

It was the first time Dorcey Wingo had seen or heard from the other film makers since the morning of the crash. After pleading not guilty the defendants were released on their own recognizance and scheduled to go to trial within 60 days. On August 5 they appeared before Judge George again to inform the court that all five elected to have a preliminary hearing and that they would appear in the courtroom on a selected date later in the year. Soon thereafter John Landis flew to London to vacation and resume work on a script by Ron Koslow, Into the Night, a project he’d started just before the TZ movie, his first serious departure from comedy. The decision by the authorities not to draw attention to Landis’ partners meant that Warner Bros. and Spielberg got off with very little in the proceedings. Spielberg only sent a one-line letter to the NTSB. Dick Vane’s grand jury alibi on the dolls let off Marshall. Warner got off by its executives’ portrayal of Landis as an independent. Their impunity, however, was not to be total. Marshall and Warner, though spared indictment, were still deeply enmeshed in the tragedy. Though the investigators accepted Marshall’s alibi, they wanted him as a witness against John Landis, while Warner Bros. found itself still very much part, if not the essential part, of the disastrous business at Indian Dunes. Along with Landis and the others, the studio was still a defendant in the civil cases and liable for millions of dollars. Again, the issue as to who should pay for the criminal cases put Warner in conflict with both its insurer and the Landis group. The wrangling and the eventual agreement between the two corporations – Warner and Travelers – were classic examples of the way in which insurance companies and their big clients work together to minimize their exposure when confronted by giant damage claims. The studio’s insurance covered the civil case costs and the actual damages which might arise from the claims of the three victims’ families. However, the criminal case costs and possible “punitive damages” were not covered by the policy Warner held with the Travelers insurance company or the coverage that was provided by another carrier. In a straightforward way Warner wanted Travelers to pay for the criminal case costs of the Landis group. Warner argued that in the long run it might cost the insurance companies more if Landis lost the criminal case. In that event, his conviction on involuntary manslaughter would undoubtedly increase the value of the claims made by the Le,", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634243667_cleaned.txt:224:e044a5482c3f", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 1828, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634243667_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634243667", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634243667_cleaned", "chunk_index": 225, "text": "were not covered by the policy Warner held with the Travelers insurance company or the coverage that was provided by another carrier.

Warner argued that in the long run it might cost the insurance companies more if Landis lost the criminal case. In that event, his conviction on involuntary manslaughter would undoubtedly increase the value of the claims made by the Le, Chen and Morrow families against the studio. Everything depended on what investigators in the case could turn up. If the prosecutor wanted to make the involuntary manslaughter charge stick, he had to nail down the question of whether the director foresaw the potential for danger on the set either before he hired the kids or while he worked them during the film’s shooting. Kesselman sought to prove “foreseeability,” a burden of proof greater than that required in civil cases in which the victims only had to show “liability” in order to get a judgment in their favor. “Foreseeability” formed the legal basis of criminal negligence. As opposed to general liability, a guilty verdict in a criminal case concerns the situation where someone has knowledge by which he is able to foresee the possibility that his conduct might result in death or loss of limb. Immediately following the indictments, Bill Vaughn of O’Melveny met with top claims officials from Travelers to discuss the fees of four of the five defendants, not including the pilot; Wingo’s employer, Western Helicopter, was covered by a different insurer, Houston Casualty. Vaughn felt that under California law the conviction of a defendant in a criminal case could be used to establish the facts against the defendant in a later civil action. For this reason, Vaughn was able to justify his request that Travelers pay for the criminal defense. The insurance company was reluctant. It had paid fees to Harland Braun up until the indictment. Vaughn argued that following the indictments both his client Warner and its insurer Travelers had even more compelling reasons to continue supporting a vigorous defense on the criminal charges. It was Vaughn’s belief that Travelers’ willingness to continue paying the criminal fees, which were, it should be remembered, not covered by the insurance policy, would help maintain the fragile united front. Vaughn noted how in the eleven months since the accident the four defendants whose lawyers had been paid by Travelers had formed a “loose but effective alliance.” Concerned about the criminal case being lost to the possibility of one or more of the defendants going to the DA (there was already a serious rift with Dorcey Wingo), Vaughn made it clear that money for the criminal defense was the only way to prevent this from happening.

Vaughn maintained that without Travelers or Warner it was probable that only John Landis would be able to hire a first-rate criminal attorney. He doubted that Folsey, Allingham and Stewart could do the same; in fact, Allingham and Stewart were said to be short of funds. As to the necessity for Warner’s behind-the-scenes posture, Vaughn explained to Travelers that the studio was in a bind: if it didn’t pay, Warner would be criticized throughout the industry for not standing behind those it had retained to make the TZ movie; if the studio openly paid for the criminal defense it might be seen as embracing the conduct of the defendants. It was not lost on either Warner or Travelers that sensational publicity surrounding the criminal case could result in disastrously high judgments later at the time of the civil trials. The amount of Travelers’ exposure, however, was limited by the $1 million ceiling on its policy with Warner. The New England based insurers knew that any huge monetary judgments won in a civil trial by the families of the three victims could be directly assessed against Warner. It was widely believed among insurance executives that the studio was directly vulnerable to potential punitive damages because of its involvement in the handling of the children. Many financial questions between the insurer and the movie company remained unresolved. However, a far-reaching united front consisting of the criminal defendants, the studio and the insurance companies congealed less than a month following the 1983 indictments. At a remarkable meeting of the lawyers representing the defendants in the civil actions, the Landis legal phalanx successfully secured a formal alliance to combat its criminal and civil adversaries. Eugene Wooley and Marty Rose; Landis’ personal attorney John Diemer; Frank Marshall’s attorney Richard Rosen, and representatives of the insurance carriers, Travelers, and for Western Helicopter, as Wingo’s employer, Houston Casualty. Of all the key movie people named as defendants in the civil lawsuits only Steven Spielberg’s attorneys, Gang, Tyre and Brown, communicated directly with Warner and were not present. A surprising degree of unanimity prevailed at this meeting. Formal discovery among the co-defendants that might produce unfavorable evidence in the case, like depositions and interrogatories, was forbidden. A gentleman’s agreement was secretly hammered out in O’Melveny’s office. It assured that the attorneys for the Morrow, Chen and Le families, as well as the district attorney’s office, would not become aware of any of the differences that existed among Landis, Marshall, Spielberg and the studio.", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634243667_cleaned.txt:226:b9564f16ab5a", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 1830, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634243667_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634243667", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634243667_cleaned", "chunk_index": 227, "text": "Warner and were not present.

It assured that the attorneys for the Morrow, Chen and Le families, as well as the district attorney’s office, would not become aware of any of the differences that existed among Landis, Marshall, Spielberg and the studio. To the same end the lawyers agreed to hold off all cross-complaints against each other and that those already on file would be placed on the back burner. The civil cases had sensationalistic value and there was a consensus among the lawyers that they should be settled as soon as possible. O’Melveny’s Bill Vaughn, representing the studio, took the hard line, arguing that even though sensationalistic, the cases of the three victims ultimately were ordinary death claims. Landis’ civil expert Eugene Wooley stressed the aggravating factors arising from the Dillon v. Legg precedent; the “emotional distress” case which established the legal principle that because of the fact that the parents of Myca and Renee actually witnessed their children die in front of their eyes they were entitled to a larger recovery than was ordinarily recommended as part of the typical wrongful death claim. A number of money figures were thrown about. One of the dozen-orso attorneys conjectured that the Morrow daughters’ case might be worth as little as $250, 000 . There was general agreement that the Chen and Le cases were worth about $1 million each. Though large, these figures were anticipated. But what the insurance carriers, and especially Warner, feared far more was the potential for punitive damages. The main difference between punitive and actual damages lay in that the former was usually not determined by the conventional loss-of-earnings formulas or economic facts of the case, but rather by the purely emotional impact the children’s deaths would have on a jury. Unlike the actual damages that a jury might award the parents, which all defendants’ lawyers agreed were in the low 1 millions, there was no telling how much a jury might award in punitive damages. A jury might decide to “punish” the studio, Landis and Spielberg and teach them a lesson. After months of haggling among the attorneys, on the eve of the preliminary hearing in late 1983, Landis and Warner came to a final understanding with the studio’s compromise to participate in funding the continuing criminal defense costs. The studio insisted, however, that its role remain confidential. Intense negotiations had developed between the film director and the studio as the result of the real threat that if the studio refused to pay for his criminal defense Landis would sue. Vaughn’s lieutenant, Scott Dunham, urged Behr not to pursue the litigious road because the “publicity would be", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634243667_cleaned.txt:227:b0e8495b3508", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 1831, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634243667_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634243667", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634243667_cleaned", "chunk_index": 228, "text": "1983, Landis and Warner came to a final understanding with the studio’s compromise to participate in funding the continuing criminal defense costs.

Vaughn’s lieutenant, Scott Dunham, urged Behr not to pursue the litigious road because the “publicity would be unfavorable.” Behr did not want publicity either, and in a memo he welcomed Warner’s decision to pay the ongoing criminal defense fees as a “turning point.” But Warner cautioned Behr that it was not prepared to write a blank check for the director and his co-defendants. The one defendant not covered under the various arrangements between Warner, Travelers and the Landis group was Dorcey Wingo. Bitter, seemingly irreconcilable differences divided them. Angry at the attempts to blame him, Wingo had filed a lawsuit against Warner and Twilight Zone Productions. Wingo’s insurance company, Houston Casualty, further aggravated the situation between the pilot and the film makers by hiring Eugene Trope from a prominent Westside legal firm best known for its divorce cases. Trope lent a sharp contrast to the dapper Century City and Hollywood lawyers on the case. With his rotund figure, baroque head and trim pointed goatee, Trope was distinct for bringing to the courtroom the flavor of turn-of-the-century Vienna. Trope was portly, graying, vested, collared, studded, fully suited with fob and chain. For reasons none of the other criminal lawyers could explain, he was apparently chosen as Wingo’s attorney for being a noted civil attorney with a prestigious name and experience in the aviation field. However, he had little experience in criminal law and, as a result, Eugene Trope would become a byword for bumbling, the stock figure in a Twilight Zone comedy of errors. In what appeared to be a direct collision course with John Landis, the civil attorneys hired to represent Wingo planned to prove that the director bore full responsibility for the crash. Their search for witnesses most critical of Landis’ behavior quickly led to Steve Lydecker’s North Hollywood home. One of Wingo’s civil attorneys noted in a memo having obtained information which “may be helpful in showing that Landis is guilty of involuntary manslaughter.” With the preliminary hearing fast approaching, A matronly lady, Virginia Kearns like Alpha Campbell was one of the few people connected with the production with whom Vic Morrow had developed a friendship. As his hairdresser she kept close to Morrow; she had to keep his hair looking the same from scene to scene.

She was angry because she felt Morrow had been pressured by the young director into doing the hazardous stunt rather than letting stunt coordinator Gary Mc-Larty take his place. She believed the rumor on the set that John Landis had talked Vic into doing the job himself as the chance to make his big comeback. She had spent a year and three months trying to forget the accident. “I had very bad nightmares; I was very close to the accident,” she told the pilot’s attorneys when they contacted her. She had been one of the last to have spoken with the actor before he died. The next day she recorded notes of her recollections. She told Wingo’s attorneys that in her final conversation with Vic he had been extremely nervous. Suspecting that people on the set were high on cocaine, he kept going around and looking into people’s eyes. He first went up to Wingo and looked into the pilot’s eyes. “I think he’s straight,” he reported to Virginia. She then asked if he had checked Landis’ eyes, “Did you see them?” Vic said, “Yes. They’re pinpointed. The son-of-a-bitch is crazy.” That evening she had firsthand experience with the supercharged director when he sat down for a haircut. After trimming his hair – ”I declined doing the beard” – she turned the frenetic personality over to her friend, Melanie Levitt, the makeup artist. “I let Melanie do it and it took almost 45 minutes because he couldn’t sit still long enough in the chair for her to do a really good job.” When Wingo’s attorney wondered whether perhaps all the pressure had simply made the director nervous, Virginia countered brusquely. “There’s a difference between nervousness and craziness. I thought Landis was crazy. I am sorry.” She recalled that he was extremely “hyper,” with arms flying at all times. “I would have to say he was totally psyched out,” smiling one second and screaming the next, she recalled, Landis couldn’t sit still for a second. Vic had mentioned to her one particularly frightening scene in the Vietnam jungle sequence when he shared the make-believe Santa Clara swamp with a live python while hiding from the Viet Cong. Even John Landis, who maintained that he was fearless throughout the explosions in the final scenes, admitted in a highly confidential moment to his attorneys that, frankly, being next to the big python in the water had him rattled. “It was the only time I feared for my own safety,” he said, “when the snake got away and came toward us, we went, Whoaa.” But Vic was terrified, then angry.

He complained to friends that he had a skin allergy that was aggravated by being in water, but that John Landis made him stand in the river until the snake was ready. Everything was “overdone.” Virginia gave other examples when the super-realism turned frightening: the gun fire in the water (“He used real bullets”); the Ku Klux Klan flame gag (“Gary McLarty almost got burned because they wanted a couple of seconds longer”); the Nazi sequence in which a fire broke out while people were locked in the railroad car (“If somebody hadn’t screamed, ‘Get ‘em out of there!’ they could all have died”). But there was one element pertaining to that last night in the desert dunes which was difficult for Kearns to convey to the pilot’s attorneys. No one who hadn’t been there that night could have a sense of the atmosphere of eeriness and foreboding on the Twilight Zone set, of a reality that threatened to dissolve at any moment under some horrific freak of man or nature. “Everybody felt uncomfortable about the whole situation,” the matronly lady recalled. She thought of the “Dodge girl” that was decapitated by a movie crane during the shooting of a TV commercial. Vic kept ruminating about his experience on the Combat series, remarking each time that there had never been an accident. Virginia Kearns’ stinging account supported the pilot in his lawsuit which held the director responsible for the crash. After all of Landis’ finger-pointing at Wingo it redressed the balance for him. Nonetheless it still did not erase the conclusion that Wingo had been so eager to fly in a Spielberg movie that he had himself skimped certain cautions normally taken by a pilot. Strictly from the FAA standpoint, he should have gotten a waiver for the explosives scenes, since, in accordance with regulations, every pilot at the time was required to prepare an operation plan for any stunt-type movie performance in which he was involved. Prior to his first flight Wingo never had a detailed meeting with the special effects crew. He admitted to NTSB investigators that he had talked with Paul Stewart only the week before the Indian Dunes filming. He had no flight manual with him as required by FAA regulations; there were no proper seat belts and the chopper’s torque meter was not functioning.

He had no flight manual with him as required by FAA regulations; there were no proper seat belts and the chopper’s torque meter was not functioning. Most importantly, Wingo could not deny that as a pilot he had been put on notice after the evening’s second flight, the rage scene. He even told the NTSB, “It was a risky thing to film.” Yet he took no steps to ensure greater safety. His attorneys could only explain the pilot’s damaging compromises as the result of chaos on the set and intimidation by the director. Curiously, Wingo’s lawyers found that everybody had heard the story of Vic’s big comeback. Even the pilot was led to believe that the final scene was designed to help Vic Morrow’s career. Wingo was told by Dan Allingham that in the exploding village scene, “John was going to recuperate Vic Morrow (sic), that his career had been sagging a little bit and that he had always sort of been a bad guy.” Wingo was told that Vic would still be a “bad guy” throughout the movie “until the very end when these two children showed up at the village. But even Wingo could see after meeting Vic for the first time on the set that the actor appeared far from pleased. Morrow was cold and wrapped in a blanket and to Wingo “he looked tired and unhappy.” The pilot’s last encounter with Morrow was part of that eeriness Virginia Kearns felt so vividly that last night of shooting. It occurred during one of the many last-minute adjustments Landis made to intensify the excitement in the final scene. The director surprised Wingo by appearing with the show’s star to make one last request of the pilot who’d already been shaken during the near fatal rage scene. thers besides Virginia Kearns acknowledged that feeling of the unexpected. It was in the air, it seemed, mixed with the gas va-O pors. A soundman on the set named Roger Pietschmann, put a wireless microphone on Morrow for the 11:30 scene. The soundman said he thought he heard the tired actor mutter to himself. Among the very last of the crew to see Vic before he died was the show’s makeup artist, Melanie Levitt. Just before the final shot, while standing in the fume-laden village, she had admonished Elie Cohn for smoking on the set because of the gasoline. She saw Vic pick up the children to test their weight. Her last words to the actor were jokingly, “I’ll send flowers.” The makeup lady, like the hairdresser, had observed his nervousness and concern about drug use on the set. “Please send", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634243667_cleaned.txt:231:8971f17293ec", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 1835, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634243667_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634243667", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634243667_cleaned", "chunk_index": 232, "text": "to see Vic before he died was the show’s makeup artist, Melanie Levitt.

Her last words to the actor were jokingly, “I’ll send flowers.” The makeup lady, like the hairdresser, had observed his nervousness and concern about drug use on the set. “Please send flowers,” Vic answered enigmatically. Trudy, Vic’s English girlfriend, writing Alpha Campbell from England after Morrow’s death, indignantly related the python incident: “He (Vic) thought something was very wrong on the set. But he couldn’t put his finger on it. The stunts bothered him. Especially with the shotguns. Did you know Alpha, they had real bullets? That made him very angry… Then when Landis said to Vic, did he mind waiting, while he finished filming with the snake, because it was getting cold and stiff? Never mind Vic being in water a couple of hours and then having to wait another two hours to do a shot that took five minutes. So you see Alpha, Vic was not happy. He really thought something was going on.” Before his death Vic Morrow was planning to direct a movie in which Trudy would star. It was a low-budget film called Chained Heat. His old pal Billy Fine, who was going to try to get Trudy a green card, put it together. Movie packager/promoter and aging Hollywood enfant terrible, Billy Fine was well-known about town. His packaging credits included Hedda Gabler, which got its star Glenda Jackson a 1974 Academy Award nomination for Best Actress, and Charles Bronson’s Death Wish II, among many others. Afterwards, the shameless eulogies at Vic’s funeral which tried to portray his friend’s final hours as having been happy only reinforced Fine’s suspicions of the circumstances which led Vic to do the final scene himself. “At his age Vic didn’t like doing his own stunts.” Fine believed that Morrow thought there was going to be a stunt double. Vic also told his business manager and attorney Alvin Green about his fears during the Twilight Zone filming. “Between the drinking and the coke on the set it was pretty bad,” Green remembered. I wanted to pull him off the set as late as that Thursday. But Vic said, ‘I’ve only got one more day to go, and then it’s over.’” Green explained that under his contract Vic had just cause to walk off. However, it was an important picture for Vic because it was a “Spielberg” picture, and Vic didn’t walk off. Like Billy Fine, Al Green also suspected that there was considerable evidence to show that Landis had pressured Vic to do the final scene without a stuntman.

The film’s official shooting schedule clearly showed that the exploding village scene called for a stuntman in the column “Cast and Atmosphere” marked: This meant that a double would be used for Morrow. It supported the view held by many that at the last moment, even though he always denied it, John Landis pressured Vic to lend his own person to the director’s drive for superrealism – the hard-bitten close-up of Bill framed against the background of thrilling explosions, the “wall of fire.” The most damaging evidence to show that the aging actor didn’t really know until the end what was planned by the director in the final scene was contained in a key conversation overheard the day before the fatal shot. Like so much about the five-year case that never surfaced, only the movie director’s private investigators, and not the authorities, discovered the existence of this revealing vignette. Witnessed by the set greensman, Jerry Cutten, it concerned a discussion between the 1st AD and Landis in which the greensman overheard Elie Cohn propose, “Let’s not tell Vic that we’re going to have explosions.” According to highly-confidential notes circulated among the phalanx, Cutten felt that John Landis objected to the suggestion only because, in the greensman’s words, many times actors “just freak out when something happens if they don’t know about if, ‘ That, obviously, would ruin the shot. While settlement discussions with the Chens and Les quickly reached a stalemate, talks with the Morrow girls, Carrie Morrow and Jennifer Jason Leigh, moved fast. Aware that sensationalism and publicity gave the girls’ case a higher visibility, the movie attorneys were especially eager to work out an agreement. John Landis’ civil lawyers, Kern & Wooley, underscoring the publicity value of the Morrow heirs, encouraged settlement sooner rather than later. One memo circulated among the phalanx warning that a history of mental instability of one of the Morrow heirs might interfere with a smooth settlement. So, with the approach of the preliminary hearing at the end of ^(𝔠₈₃) the issue became urgent. Landis’ civil lawyers felt that if the judge held over the defendants at the prelim to go to trial the Morrow girls’ claims would actually increase in value. Landis’ main civil attorney wrote Behr, after reviewing the films of the crash, “I’m concerned that the cases might have a higher value than initially evaluated if the films are shown to the trier of fact.” Behr went along with the recommendation provided the", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634243667_cleaned.txt:233:f0e52aad944b", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 1837, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634243667_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634243667", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634243667_cleaned", "chunk_index": 234, "text": "the end of ^(𝔠₈₃) the issue became urgent.

As the actual settlement with the actor’s daughters neared, Al Green, Vic’s long-time lawyer and manager, faded out of the picture. Green still followed the case as an interested party; he had written Vic’s final will. Vic left everything to his eldest daughter Carrie, while leaving a symbolic $100 to Jennifer, his estranged daughter. Green had taken care of Carrie during difficult periods in her adolescence and had been first to inform her of her father’s death. Originally, he assumed that he would represent her in Vic’s death. But following the weekend of Vic’s funeral Carrie changed her mind and told Green, one of her father’s pallbearers, “Jennifer wants me to go to Barbara’s lawyer” (Barbara Turner, Vic’s ex-wife, and the girls’ mother). The new lawyer was Sydney Irmas. Within three months after proposing it to the movie lawyers Irmas shrank down his original $2.75 million settlement demand to a mere $840, 000 for both girls, the amount to be deposited in a Merrill-Lynch account that would bear interest and pay the girls accordingly. The movie makers jumped at this relatively mild settlement. They even attached to it extraordinary conditions which by going far beyond the normal terms in assuring confidentiality of the negotiations revealed more than the usual Hollywood paranoia over bad publicity. When considered alongside the payment schedule, the secrecy provisions of the settlement bought the silence of Vic Morrow’s two daughters well into the next century. Although the financial figures favored Carrie, the real beneficiary was the younger Jennifer who would have been cut off with $100 if it had gone according to Vic’s will. Now, under the hastily worked-out terms, each immediately received $81, 000 , in addition to a $2, 000 monthly payment for the rest of their lives. In 1994 they would each receive another $50, 000 and in the year 2004 Carrie would receive $275, 000 and Jennifer $75, 000 . But in exchange the girls agreed to harsh provisions designed, it seemed, to make it appear that Vic Morrow never existed; the Morrow girls agreed not to “in any way participate in or contribute to any public discussion about the accident.” Perhaps even more Draconian was the condition which practically compelled them to efface their father from their own lives by not talking in public, “nor contribute to other publicity concerning or in any", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634243667_cleaned.txt:234:df164ec8fa4d", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 1838, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634243667_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634243667", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634243667_cleaned", "chunk_index": 235, "text": "000 and Jennifer $75, 000 .

He took his fee, $175, 000 , right away. When Vic’s lawyer Al Green heard about the settlement he was shocked and amazed. He assessed Carrie’s case at least “worth a minimum of $4 million and as much as up to $5 million.” he indictments of Landis, Folsey and Allingham had no adverse effect on the continued upward mobility of their careers. Just as T the grand jury had earlier played against the giant box-office success of Trading Places, the arraignment was set against the background of Landis’ fresh success, a film project with Michael Jackson, the million-dollar music-video blockbuster Thriller, as it turned out, to become part of the biggest-selling record and video package in the industry’s young history. Thriller, which has Jackson turning into a werewolf with corpses and ghouls rising from their graves, was inspired by Landis’ 1981 An American Werewolf in London, featuring Rick Baker’s Academy Award winning work. Landis and Folsey produced it with Jackson. It was released a few months after the arraignment in November 1983. Michael Jackson first approached Landis about the Thriller project because of his relationship with makeup wizard Rick Baker whose intimate relationship with John Landis since the days of Schlock! was well-known throughout the industry. In making the deal with Jackson, Baker’s loyalty to Landis was an important bargaining chip. Landis’ lawyer, who also represented Baker, made a deal whereby Landis and Baker came as a package. Landis demanded that he share the credits and part of the profits with Jackson. The high-profile project could not have come at a better time for Folsey either, and for the little wheel on the troika, Dan Allingham, who worked on Thriller, again as UPM. The set on which Thriller was shot was visited by a steady stream of Jackson’s friends, such as Jackie Onassis, making it acceptable to shake hands with Hollywood’s only director ever to be charged with manslaughter. In a strategy worked out at Jackson’s Encino home, Landis and Jackson decided to open Thriller in a double bill with Walt Disney’s classic Fantasia.

Though it might have seemed a clever idea to ride on the Disney name and put John Landis’ new release in the company of Hollywood legend, the strategy was a bust. The family-oriented Fantasia clashed with the brutal imagery of Thriller. It not only created bad publicity for the director but again cast serious doubts on his judgment. When Rick Baker’s big-screen Thriller werewolf transformation scene first began showing in Westwood just after Thanksgiving 1983, Folsey and Landis were shocked to see screaming children followed by angry parents flee into the lobby. On Folsey’s suggestion the theatre manager posted a warning, alerting parents to the possible danger of the short subject Thriller to children. In addition, each screening was preceded by an unusual personal message from the theatre manager speaking from the front of the auditorium: While Landis worked on Thriller, Tom Budds ran down one of his more intriguing new witnesses. Prosecutor Gary Kesselman had impressed on Budds that Landis’ former personal secretary had firsthand knowledge of Landis’ involvement in the cover-up. When Budds first contacted Alpha Campbell she no longer worked for Landis. He had fired her just before the grand jury while he was in New York filming Trading Places. Since the days of the crash Alpha had been witness to many strange occurrences in Landis’ Universal bungalow. Three weeks after the crash, Alpha confronted one of the early mysteries. Someone had entered the bungalow over the weekend and removed the phone messages from the director’s daily log covering the period of the crash for the entire month of July and the first two weeks of August. She noted in the daily phone log: July 1 to August 13, 1982 all messages gone (disappeared) over weekend. She told Landis and he casually promised he would take care of it. The director’s first attempts to dispose of Alpha had met with failure. Landis couldn’t easily fire her because she was protected by her union at Universal. At last, he called from New York and vowed to Universal executive Sean Daniel and his assistant Bruce Berman that he would not come back from New York until they got rid of Alpha. Shortly thereafter, Alpha’s supervisor told her that Landis wanted her off the job and that if she decided to fight, the supervisor added ominously, it would become “very dirty.” Bowing under pressure, the secretary who once regaled Landis with stories about working with Alfred Hitchcock, finally sought transfer to another position.

From her supervisor she learned that the reason for all the ruckus was the upcoming “trial,” referring to the grand jury. It was not until more than a year after the crash that Tom Budds first called Alpha at Universal Studios. He asked if she would answer a few questions. At first reluctant, Alpha cited the pressures of a new assignment and the fact that she would be going on vacation soon. Moments later, uncertain and frightened, she called Universal executive Bruce Berman. Since it was her understanding that Berman had taken her off the job in Landis’ office, she informed him about the call from the homicide man. Berman wasted no time. He told her that he would get back to her. But Berman did not call back. Instead, one of Landis’ lawyers did. Speaking on behalf of Joel Behr, lawyer John Diemer dissuaded her from cooperating with the police, telling her that the sheriff ’s department couldn’t force her to be interviewed. Diemer urged Alpha not to be afraid and that Leonard Levine, a criminal lawyer, would call her and further explain the situation. Levine called a half hour later. He advised her on how to deal with Budds. In her neat secretarial way, she recorded the lawyer’s instructions in her notes: “You do not want to speak to him before you go on vacation… I should call the Sheriffs Department on Monday, as promised and tell him THAT I CANNOT MEET WITH HIM. I AM TOO PRESSURED WITH TIME. I DO NOT WISH TO SPEAK TO HIM AT THIS TIME IN THE CASE. OR, SORRY, I APPRECIATE YOUR DESIRE TO TALK TO ME ABOUT MR. LANDIS, BUT I DO NOT WISH TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT THIS CASE. OF COURSE, IF YOU WANT TO SUBPOENA ME, IT IS YOUR RIGHT DO SO AND I’LL OBEY.” (sic) Alpha Campbell’s real name was Del Monte. At the time she joined Landis she was in her mid-fifties. She had come to America from Germany after World War II while still a teenager with a career already behind her, begun at 16 when she published her first novel, as a French-German authoress. She frequented Hollywood literary circles that included Aldous Huxley and members of the expatriate film colony.

Before he fired her, John Landis had originally been anxious to have her as his secretary because she had typed scripts for Alfred Hitchcock. She had not been amused by her cocky young boss who referred to her as a “Nazi.” Alpha’s cooperation with investigators did not come about smoothly. In his customary style Sheriff Budds initially nearly botched the breakthrough. A personal visit from the deputy district attorney brought Landis’ former secretary around, and Kesselman was amazed to find a wealth of information. For the first time many vital production documents fell into the hands of the investigators. Alpha Campbell told Kesselman about suspicious activities in the office after the accident, boxes moving between Warner and the Universal lot and Century City, the destruction and concealment of scripts, and the disappearance of Landis’ phone records. She supplied Kesselman with copies of important documents, including all four drafts of the script. Kesselman decided to put Alpha on as a witness at the prelim and announced his choice as was required of him to Landis’ attorney. Just a month before the prelim was scheduled to begin a colorful package arrived at Alpha’s desk at Universal. It was a fancy box of Mrs. Beasly’s Cookies from a Malibu bakery patronized by the status-conscious Hollywood crowd. Alpha asked the messenger who delivered it to wait. She opened the envelope and read the card: “Merry Xmas, With Much Love,” signed John, Rachel and Deborah. Following the indictments, one key witness, Spielberg’s closest associate, the most senior production official on the set that night-remained obdurate in his refusal to cooperate with Budds. Budds first realized he’d have trouble with Frank Marshall when in late 1983 he went to The Burbank Studios to serve him with a subpoena. At Marshall’s office he was met by Bonnie Radford’s sister, Mary Radford, at the time Frank Marshall’s assistant. When Budds asked to see Bonnie or Frank, Mary Radford told him they weren’t in. After many similar failures to serve Marshall the subpoena, Budds at last arranged for sheriff ’s investigators to stake out Marshall’s house in Santa Monica. When that failed, he called Marshall’s attorney Rick Rosen. Budds learned that Marshall was off in England working on a film. The attorney promised that as soon as his client returned, he would notify Budds. “There’s little question in my mind that Marshall didn’t want to be interviewed,” Budds concluded. “We went to his place of business, we went to his home. We spoke to his attorney several months back, and we waited for his return from England.” When the controversy", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634243667_cleaned.txt:238:7f24b2d13f06", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 1842, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634243667_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634243667", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634243667_cleaned", "chunk_index": 239, "text": "that failed, he called Marshall’s attorney Rick Rosen.

He’s busy working out of town.” Joel Behr, the Hollywood lawyer, while remaining grand strategist, yielded to Harland Braun in the criminal court. This was indisputably Braun’s territory and the preliminary hearing turned out to be his finest hour. He had been on the case for 11/2 years while Joel Behr called the shots. At the prelim he finally got to do what he was paid for – to defend his client in open court. Harland Braun was a legal hard-charger. He was not meant for soft-footed counselor behind-the-scenes. His rapier wit required a courtroom setting. He was known for aggressive cross-examining. Like a relentless hammer he humiliated and embarrassed witnesses and beat them into inconsistencies. Judge Brian Crahan, the prelim’s presiding judge, had once before ruled in Braun’s favor. This time Braun actually succeeded in getting some of the counts dismissed. The prelim was also where Braun first aired his ingenious new theory to explain the crash, an alternative to the debris theory cited by the NTSB that would become very big in the trial. As always he was generous to the media. They received ample quotes and plenty of barbs of mockery and ridicule of his opponent, prosecutor Gary Kesselman. Granted at the behest of the defense, preliminary hearings in California determine whether the charges merit a trial. Even if the hearing were to fail the TZ defendants by not dropping the charges against them, Braun favored the “prelim.” Unlike the grand jury, the prelim allows the defendants’ lawyers to cross-examine witnesses while the judge decides whether or not to hold over the defendants for the actual trial. At the prelim the prosecutor has to show his hand. Besides defining the issues in the case and the evidence against Landis, the prelim would serve Braun, in addition, as a way of testing the impact of new facts to be used in the Twilight Zone defense, notably the “delamination theory.” Joel Behr in his Century City office prepared for the prelim on two fronts.

The first had to do with the new delamination theory. Technical experts, brought in by the phalanx to try and explain the factors that had brought the helicopter down, intended to show that the director could not possibly have anticipated that the illusion-creating special effects could be so powerful as to blast a helicopter out of the sky. Offthe-record talks between the phalanx and NTSB investigators had pretty much established that the soon-to-be-published NTSB findings would indicate that debris from the No. 4 shoreline hut had damaged the tail rotor and caused the crash. As debris was a known and foreseeable hazard for a low-flying helicopter, and there was ample evidence that the helicopter pilot issued several warnings to the director about debris hazards, the anticipated NTSB findings did not bode well for a Landis defense based on unforseeability. However, with “delamination” Braun came up with the perfect alternative theory; a strange and unfamiliar word that would puzzle jurors and spectators in the trial, and prove very effective in the preliminary hearing. While the new theory also held that the helicopter crash was caused by damage to the tail rotor, it did not blame debris, as the NTSB’s Llorente had concluded; instead, the metal skin of the tail rotor had “delaminated,” detached and separated from the blade because the adhesive which bonds the skin to the blade failed when exposed to the heat of the SFX explosives. As never in the annals of aviation history had there been a helicopter crash caused by delamination, not even during combat involving intense exposure to napalm, the theory “proved” that the accident was unforeseeable and not due to negligence. “Delamination” dominated the prelim and resurfaced during the trial as one of the main buoys of the defense. On the second front the phalanx aimed to use the prelim to show how Landis’ use of stunts and special effects did not depart from the custom and practice of Hollywood film making. George Folsey Jr. went to De Forest Research, a Hollywood company specializing in script research, looking for a list of motion pictures for possible use as evidence in a film montage. Braun worked with Folsey on this cinematic presentation designed to demonstrate how other film makers used screen illusion in scenes with explosions. On the eve of the prelim, in a small editing room in North Hollywood, Folsey and Braun spent hours looking through reels of motion picture footage for scenes resembling that of the crash in Indian Dunes. They searched for the ideal clip from another movie that combined all three elements – a helicopter, explosives and kids.

They searched for the ideal clip from another movie that combined all three elements – a helicopter, explosives and kids. Unable to find the right combination, they settled on a montage with just the combination of helicopter and special effects alone. A 30-minute montage was assembled from four films: Apocalypse Now, The Deerhunter, The Exterminator, and V. This was eventually shown to Judge Crahan. As Harland Braun mapped out other lines of defense, Joel Behr approved some and turned down others. Behr himself continued to be enthralled by having a famous director testify at the prelim on special effects and their role in creating film illusion. He arranged a meeting between Harland Braun and John Huston through one of his clients, producer Michael Fitzgerald, then producing the film adaption of Malcolm Lowry’s Under the Volcano; Huston, in town cutting the film, though he had never met the young Landis, with characteristic feistiness declared himself willing to defend a fellow-director who had some problems with the authorities. Back in the 30s, Huston had himself had a run-in with the LA district attorney over the mysterious death of a young girl. Huston was never tried but the experience left him so shaken that he was unable to work for a year. It also left him a generous, if indiscriminate sympathy for a director in a similar plight. John Huston had a rough-and-tumble way of talking about special effects. He bantered with Braun about the scene in the African Queen where Humphrey Bogart and Katherine Hepburn come out of the swamp covered with leeches. Huston insisted on the inevitability of danger on a movie set. Braun specifically remembered Huston’s alarming description of an accident on his own set while filming in Japan when a series of boats broke loose, nearly killing the director and the crew. Huston as a witness, Braun noted, “was scary, too dangerous.” In California the prelim is usually no more than a quick formality, over and done within 10 or 20 minutes. But with the Twilight Zone case this pre-trial judicial proceeding entered a new dimension in which time stretched. It lasted a month and produced a fresh mountain of testimony, adding 20 volumes to the already staggering documentation concerning this extraordinary disaster on a movie set. The prelim was memorable for the surprising introduction as evidence by the defense of a fourth clip of film footage which, like the fatal 2:20 shot, showed the combination of kids and explosives.

The prelim was memorable for the surprising introduction as evidence by the defense of a fourth clip of film footage which, like the fatal 2:20 shot, showed the combination of kids and explosives. Until this showing John Landis had made a point of highlighting his own cleverness by ridiculing in private to his attorney the investigators’ incompetence due to their failure to identify and impound the 9:30 shot; the first scene to be filmed the night of the crash, it was necessary from the standpoint of continuity to an understanding of the conclusion of the escape from the exploding village at 2:20. Raising it at the prelim was designed to cast doubt on the parents of the children who claimed that they were never told about the explosives in the fatal scene. If the parents were present for the explosion scene at 9:30, Behr reasoned, they must have had knowledge that their kids would be in a scene with explosives at 2:20. Unexpectedly, some of the most damaging testimony came from Landis’ close, longtime friend, script supervisor Kathryn Wooten. She testified to an incident, the existence of which, though already well-established, yet still had much mystery surrounding it; the fact that in the final seconds before the fatal scene Landis screamed through a bullhorn that people on the set stand up for the upcoming fireball display. Every investigator had made note of it, as it pointed to foreseeability, saying in effect that the director had to have known that the shot was dangerous. The 1st AD Elie Cohn had minimized the significance of Landis’ final communication with the spectators by telling investigators the director had told him it was done so that people could take the shock waves from the blast better. But much to Landis’ dismay, under direct examination at the prelim, Kathryn Wooten recalled Landis’ summons to spectators to be on their feet, “which he often said on films I’ve worked with him before, anything that had potential danger (sic).” Since there had been no similar warning to the spectators from the director at 11:30, the inference was that in his own mind the final shot was dangerous. Wooten at the end of her testimony seemed to indicate as much, saying that because 11:30 was a much smaller shot. “There: would really be no reason to tell anybody to move or stand up.” Braun asked for a brief recess before he began his cross-examination of the script girl who’d worked with Landis on Kentucky Fried Movie, Animal House and Blues Brothers. In the hallway, outside the presence of the judge and spectators, he was surprised to see his client fly at Wooten, enraged, cursing the script", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634243667_cleaned.txt:242:49a99217218c", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 1846, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634243667_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634243667", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634243667_cleaned", "chunk_index": 243, "text": "to indicate as much, saying that because 11:30 was a much smaller shot. “There: would really be no reason to tell anybody to move or stand up.” Braun asked for a brief recess before he began his cross-examination of the script girl who’d worked with Landis on Kentucky Fried Movie, Animal House and Blues Brothers. In the hallway, outside the presence of the judge and spectators, he was surprised to see his client fly at Wooten, enraged, cursing the script girl and shouting profanities at her because of her testimony. Some minutes later, back in the courtroom under Braun’s cross-examination, Landis’ last-minute warning to the crowd on the TZ set no longer signaled any particular danger to her. She now said that the director routinely made requests for people to stand up “whenever there is any action on the set like explosions or cars.” After the hallway castigation from the director who was also her friend, she mentioned having heard such warnings spoken to her “many times before and by other directors.” Along with some of Landis’ powerful studio friends like Universal’s Sean Daniel and Paramount’s Jeffrey Katzenberg, the preliminary hearing was attended in part by another personal friend, Berkeley psychologist Daniel Goldstine, who had a long-standing friendship with the director’s closest confidant, Sean Daniel. As an expert in behavior, Goldstine used the prelim to observe Landis and make suggestions as to how his public persona might be modified. The events at the prelim rattled Landis considerably and he became particularly offensive to prosecutor Kesselman. The contrast between a young, hip, high-living Hollywood director faced with a squarish-built dresser in flashy clothes, stacked heels and slicked hair, could not be more striking. Dressing style, like ethnic types, was one of the things upon which Landis invariably felt obliged to comment out loud. In the hallway Landis was heard joking with the bailiff that he should check Kesselman’s high-heeled shoes for cocaine. The bailiff bantered back that he had to have “probable cause,” to which Landis quipped, “Well, look at his tie. He must be stoned on cocaine.” One time, hearing Landis taunt him as “the guy with the Cuban heels,” Kesselman protested to one of the lawyers. “I wear Florsheim boots. You better get that guy under control.” When the prelim concluded, Judge Crahan, in his final decision, dropped counts 2 and 4. His decision let out Landis, Folsey and Allingham on the two manslaughter counts which were based on the principle that at the time the children were illegally hired by the threesome the danger was foreseeable. After a parade of witnesses and technical experts testified that debris alone had probably not caused the crash and that heat delamination was at least partly responsible, Braun’s oratorical and legal skills carried the day for “delamination.” Judge Crahan, however, bound over Landis and the two other defendants on counts 1, 3", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634243667_cleaned.txt:243:d118d661edb3", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 1847, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634243667_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634243667", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634243667_cleaned", "chunk_index": 244, "text": "Allingham on the two manslaughter counts which were based on the principle that at the time the children were illegally hired by the threesome the danger was foreseeable.

The judge concluded: Finally, Mr. Landis with his quest for cinema verite directed the actors, as it were, including other principals, to demonstrate an effective conclusion to this film segment, which would be both noteworthy and memorable. In achieving such absolutism he appears to have gone beyond the realm of simple mechanical direction, but in fact set up, among other things, the combination of circumstances which in the final seconds of filming, caused death and destruction. There were ample warnings to these individuals prior to the 2:20 filming episode, which made their conduct from the time of such warnings, calculating, and unreasonable and therefore criminal in nature. Forla _(21/2) years following the prelim the Twilight Zone trial was de- a series of legal maneuvers. A lengthy series of writs and Supreme Court. Meanwhile, a series of “continuances” granted by the court enabled John Landis to continue making movies. As a million-dollar-fee director his earnings climbed phenomenally. Just on Twilight Zone: The Movie, he split with Spielberg a little under a million from the first three months’ revenues alone. The period between the prelim and trial brought John Landis nearly $5 million in director’s fees. After Trading Places and Michael Jackson’s Thriller video, the following year was again a very busy one. A strong “personal” relationship with Paramount’s young production executive, Dawn Steel, helped Landis and Folsey produce a movie for Paramount adapted from the famous Parker Brothers board game, Clue, directed by British film maker Jonathan Lynn, best-known in Britain for his popular television series, Mr. Minister. Starring Martin Mull and the woman whose name appeared on Alpha Campbell’s list of the director’s most frequently-called people, Colleen Camp, the seductive bikini-girl from Apocalypse Now, Clue failed to make any money. Following the partially successful results at the prelim, even more legal funding was required. The cost of all these efforts was now being fully shouldered by Warner Bros., even though its spokesmen continued to decline to comment whether the studio paid for Landis’ defense. The Travelers insurance company had paid half the defense costs up to the prelim and, according to their agreement with the studio, dropped out of the 50-50 deal. Although the officers at the insurance company admitted being impressed by the new findings, they noted dryly to Warner that as a result of the prelim", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634243667_cleaned.txt:244:3124b1b57752", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 1848, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634243667_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634243667", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634243667_cleaned", "chunk_index": 245, "text": "these efforts was now being fully shouldered by Warner Bros., even though its spokesmen continued to decline to comment whether the studio paid for Landis’ defense.

Although the officers at the insurance company admitted being impressed by the new findings, they noted dryly to Warner that as a result of the prelim the settlement values stemming from the deaths of Renee and Myca had increased. Warner’s decision to continue disbursing money to the legal firms was set forth in communications between the lawyers. The studio desired not to have it appear within the industry that it was willing to abandon Landis, and as it perceived the results of the criminal trial to be binding on the civil cases, Warner became the single source from which the criminal lawyers received their fees. More money from the studio allowed Behr to make fresh preparations. He enlarged the ranks by hiring new lawyers to formulate writs. Immediately after the prelim he appealed a portion of Judge Crahan’s decision, filing a 995 motion to dismiss, on insufficiency of evidence, the three remaining counts, arguing that since delamination made the accident unforeseeable there should be no trial. At Behr’s suggestion the famous Harvard lawyer and media figure, known to millions for rapid-fire legal opinions on ABC-TV, Alan Dershowitz, was brought aboard to help formulate the writs. Dershowitz had just won a great victory with the acquittal of Claus Von Bulow in a sensational New York society murder trial. On the civil front O’Melveny’s Bill Vaughn conducted hard-nosed negotiations on behalf of the studio with the redoubtable aircraft recovery specialist Ned Good, who represented Myca’s parents. Any offer of less than a million would be seen as an insult to his clients and a declaration of war, Good forewarned. At the same time that Vaughn coordinated the efforts on behalf of Warner Bros., he made money offers to the Le and Chen families. The figure was deliberately low. It was hoped that any giant damage awards could be controlled by partially blaming the parents for being willing participants who understood the risk to their children. Vaughn’s offer was for $500, 000 to each family. Ned Good declared war. As part of developing a successful strategy for the criminal trial the phalanx quietly argued its case among industry opinion-makers. At major studios John Landis had close supporters like Dawn Steel at Paramount, Jeffrey Katzenberg at Disney and Lucy Fisher at Warner, all of whom would hopefully echo Universal’s Sean Daniel’s message that Landis was unfairly put on trial for what was “obviously” a human catastrophe, “not a criminal act.” Braun tried to establish in the mind of the public that Hollywood itself was being put on trial.

The press quoted Braun that Landis was being persecuted solely because he was a successful director. Braun implied a shared fate by calling Hollywood “the biggest moving target in town.” Behind the scenes, Behr and Braun made this case vigorously to the Directors Guild of America. Braun had been told by Folsey and Landis that DGA president Gil Cates was sympathetic. For some time, the DGA had been struggling in its Sunset headquarters with a growing runaway production crisis and the gist of Braun’s lobbying was that the Twilight Zone case additionally threatened to drive directors out of California. Joel Behr, meanwhile, advised Michael Franklin, national executive secretary of the DGA, that it was in the guild’s best interest to support John Landis’ efforts to have the NTSB drop from its final report the language it borrowed from the DGA statement on safety on the set. Specifically, Landis’ point man sought to have both the NTSB and the DGA leadership retract its official position that “safety on the set is the director’s responsibility.” While not altogether successful at the DGA’s executive level, Behr succeeded in convincing some of Hollywood’s top directors that their fate depended on the outcome of the case. The names of these directors surfaced in a letter called “A basic truth of filmmaking,” composed by Folsey and publicist Saul Kahan, and published in Rolling Stone magazine and the Los Angeles Times. The letter was signed by 16 of the DGA’s most prominent members, including Francis Ford Coppola, George Lucas, John Huston, Sidney Lumet, Billy Wilder, Fred Zinneman and Ron Howard. With the letter in hand Behr urged the DGA to issue an official guild statement for the purpose of convincing the NTSB that the substance of its approach to the director’s responsibility for safety was misguided. He backed it up by the strong testimonial of the 16 top directors, among whom, hardly noticed at the time, the name of Steven Spielberg was missing. The existence of blue-ribbon Landis support within the DGA and elsewhere merely reflected what had long been painfully apparent; to the extent that Hollywood was still unaware of the actual circumstances at Indian Dunes the night of the crash, the cover-up was a success. The DGA’s own safety committee put off discussing the subject until after the trial.

The DGA’s own safety committee put off discussing the subject until after the trial. With the flow of information carefully controlled by Landis’ legal phalanx, it was doubtful that any of the directors cast for cameos in Landis’ films or signatory to Folsey’s “basic truth” knew about the near miss at 11:30, or about the inexperienced helicopter pilot selected for budgetary considerations; about the special effects crew and alcohol, the intimidation by the director, or the full extent of the concealment of the kids. Like John Huston most directors accepted the tragedy as an industrial accident; not one of them had seen the fatal footage. The decision to bind Landis over for trial had no effect on the filming or on the post-production work of Into the Night. Far from persecuting him, top city officials even stepped in so that Into the Night might have the LAX airport for location shooting of certain chase sequences. City commissioners had first rebuffed Landis, saying they didn’t want the airport used for the shooting of terrorist scenes. But George Folsey Jr. pulled off a coup. The optimism that had followed Braun’s success at the prelim was short-lived. Braun suffered a severe setback when the new judge, Gordon Ringer, after hearing arguments, rejected the 995 motion filed by Braun earlier to dismiss the remaining three manslaughter counts on insufficiency of evidence. The judge agreed, ”This isn’t nickelodeon time anymore”; the case should go to trial. The defeat of the new motion was in sharp contrast to the prelim where the judge kicked two of the five counts. In fact, the new judge reversed Judge Crahan’s earlier ruling, restoring the two counts. The phalanx was back on square one. Delamination was apparently dead. All five counts again loomed at the trial. Braun’s prestige in the case never recovered. In the view of many, this blow in Judge Ringer’s court foreshadowed his eventual fall from being the lead criminal counsel on the case and his final replacement by a new attorney. The days of his personal friendship with the director were over – no more invitations to be in Landis’ movies; no more exchanges of gifts, like the game of Hollywood Trivial Pursuit the lawyer had given his client earlier that year; and no more yucking-it-up over Joel Behr’s exaggerated hair-piece, the imposing blue bouffant which until then had always been good for a chortle between the lawyer and his famous client.

In a seemingly unrelated event, on Saturday night, November 3, 1984, the LAPD raided in LA’s Hispanic downtown a taxi-dance place, Club El Gaucho, where customers paid 25 cents a minute to dance with hostesses to live music. El Gaucho, one of ten licensed hostess dance clubs in the city, served no alcohol. In an earlier raid that year police had taken in hostesses for lewd conduct. In the latest raid, on the eve of Judge Ringer’s important hearing, police arrested ten people, one for lewd conduct in one of the back rooms. All of them illegal aliens from Mexico and Central America, they were turned over to the Immigration & Naturalization Service. The name of one of the partners in the club was Abraham Mohammed-Issa. The other was Gary Kesselman. Someone tipped the Los Angeles Times about the raid and the morning newspaper gave it headline billing. The police commissioner warned Kesselman that El Gaucho was a potential location for prostitution. (A bilingual agent dispatched by Landis’ own investigator to look into the El Gaucho scandal wrote a report for the phalanx dispelling the idea that the taxi-dance place was a house of prostitution, epitomizing the girls, “In a word, they’re dogs.”) According to the police commissioner, the Times reported, the Twilight Zone prosecutor pledged to avoid lewd conduct and increase lighting in the dance hall, to remove curtained areas, and reconsider whether it was necessary for the club to have three television-viewing rooms at the back of the hall. The effect of the raid on Kesselman’s personal standing was devastating. The exposure of his connection with taxi-dancing destroyed his moral stature. But as his authority in court fell to zero, his predicament made for much merriment in the DA’s office. Commonly heard in the hallways on the 16th floor of the Criminal Court building at the time was the joke, “Have you heard, Gary got a job dancing at the El Cid Club.” Suddenly everyone felt entitled to be disrespectful and witty at his expense. Gary Kesselman felt humiliated. It was no secret that Kesselman had many reservations as to the commonly accepted version of certain elements in the case. He differed, for instance, in his version of what had happened to the film immediately following the crash. He told lawyers in the DA’s office that, contrary to the story that the film had been exclusively in Warner’s possession, he believed it was possible that Landis had gotten hold of it and altered it.

Even before the El Gaucho fiasco his colleagues noted that he seemed “paranoid.” Kesselman suspected that witnesses had been bought out from under him and that the specter of blacklisting had affected many of the potential witnesses. He complained that it was hard to get experts to testify because they were afraid. He was particularly upset about an “accident reconstruction expert” who suddenly withdrew from the investigation after receiving a telephone call from one of Landis’ attorneys. He dropped dark hints of pressures, even suggesting that Landis had somehow influenced his superiors in the DA’s office. After his latest humiliation in the case Kesselman confidentially voiced his belief to Tom Budds that Harland Braun was behind the raid. Although it offered little comfort to the embarrassed prosecutor, Kesselman’s bitter adversary, ironically, began to feel a similar insecurity about his position. There had been many disappointments with Braun’s promises that the case would never go to trial. His victory at the prelim had lifted everybody’s spirits, especially Folsey’s and Allingham’s, since on the dismissed counts 2 and 4 they were being let out of the case. But Judge Ringer’s decision reversing the dismissal was a turning point. Braun’s irrepressible optimism had gradually become a source of annoyance to Landis and Behr. They decided they needed a second opinion. It was the first time Braun had the feeling that John Landis was dissatisfied with his handling of the case. Perhaps not coincidentally, he received the news on the day of the Ringer hearing, while driving back with Joel Behr from the court to the Universal studio lot to inform Landis of losing the motion. The year before the trial saw a lot of action on the Twilight Zone case but much of it was within the walls of Century City. The legal process created a small industry built on formulating writs and appeals. But by the end of 1985 the exhaustion of all trial delay tactics on the part of the defense was apparent and a strategy was developed for finally taking the case to trial. During that same period John Landis made another film, a $23 million production called Spies Like Us for Warner, proving that the differences between the studio and director were minor when it came to doing business. The film starred Dan Aykroyd and Chevy Chase; Aykroyd’s wife, Donna Dixon, and Steve Forrest of Dallas fame.

The film starred Dan Aykroyd and Chevy Chase; Aykroyd’s wife, Donna Dixon, and Steve Forrest of Dallas fame. It was a comedy of which Aykroyd had written the first draft while John Belushi was still alive. Aykroyd averting nuclear war, the film showed Landis’ continued recruiting drive for potential friendly witnesses to help him out in his legal troubles. With the trial coming up, his effort to win Hollywood hearts and minds was reflected in a fresh line-up of directors in cameo roles, including Michael Apted, Martin Brest, Costa-Gavras, Joel Coen, Bob Swain, and Frank Oz. (George Folsey Jr. even got Bob Hope to make a cameo appearance through the help of his ninety-year-old father who knew Hope from the wartime USO shows). For Spies Like Us, John Landis received his standard $1 million directing fee. The film was released for the ‘85 Christmas season and received a terrible drubbing from the critics. While his legal defense was able to delay his day in court, elsewhere, on and off the set, Landis encountered constant reminders of his notoriety. In his movie and business life it showed most noticeably in a more cautious attitude among some Hollywood stars and producers. Before making Spies, Folsey and Landis were very far into an arrangement with rock record producer David Geffen to do a remake of Roger Corman’s famed Little Shop of Horrors that had featured a young Jack Nicholson. They had developed a budget and were close to making the final deal, but they could never make the terms with Geffen who refused to give in to Landis’ demand for final cut. When in the end Geffen decided on another client of Joel Behr’s, Frank Oz, to do the remake of the Corman classic, Landis’ friends in the industry interpreted it as Geffen turning his back on the director. The rub between them became clear sometime later at a party where Geffen in an exchange with Landis responded sharply, “Yea, John, but I didn’t kill three people.” It caused a feud between the two men, and a similar incident embroiled Landis with the co-star of Spies, Chevy Chase. Relations between the director and the boyish comedy star were already strained, dating back to the success of Animal House. Chase at the time had a feud with Belushi stemming from ego clashes on Saturday Night Live. Universal had wanted Chase to play the part in Animal House of a character called Otter but he missed getting the role.

Universal had wanted Chase to play the part in Animal House of a character called Otter but he missed getting the role. On the set of Spies Chase’s relationship with Landis was further irritated by the film’s shooting conditions in the frozen wilds of Norway, holed up with the Spies crew in a remote town named Songdahl. Chase had just become a father, and he had just finished making Fletch with director Michael Richie. He hadn’t wished to start shooting that early but, because of the missed U.S. winter weather and the Christmas release date for the film that year, the set was moved to Norway, which still offered snow scenes. Aside from some esthetic differences Chevy had with the director during the filming, an accident he witnessed on the set really shook him up. It involved a scene with gunfire and non-Hollywood horses. Unused to gunfire, the local Norwegian horses spooked and, charging into a camera platform, knocked over equipment, nearly causing a fatality among the cameramen. The incident was reminiscent of the night on the TZ set during the filming of the Klan sequence when the dogs went wild due to guns being fired over their heads. Even Folsey recalled, “It was like ‘holy shit’ for a while. It was scary. The cameraman was knocked down and Chevy said something about it.” In what everyone present took as an obvious reference to the Twilight Zone crash, Chase quipped, “I guess it’s another John Landis film.” With Braun’s influence on the wane, Joel Behr actively sought a new attorney to help in filing the appeals to Landis’ setback at the 995 hearing. He brought in the media-wise professor from Harvard, Alan Dershowitz, to assist in the formulation of the appeal and as consultant on projecting Landis’ best image to the public. At the same time Dershowitz was trying to sell the screenplay rights to his book on the Von Bulow case in Hollywood and asked Landis for his opinion. Landis, after reading the book, criticized the professor for repeatedly praising himself in his work. The first hint indicating that John Landis was really serious about bringing in a new lead lawyer came when Behr told him they wanted a “gray-haired eminence” to soften Landis’ image. Braun actually bought the idea of a co-counsel and was interested to hear the big-name trial attorneys Landis had been seeing around the country, among them Washington, D.C.’s Edward Bennett Williams, San Francisco’s Melvin Belli, and less known nationally by name but better known for the notoriety of his cases ( Jimmy Hoffa, Watergate, Ford Pinto, Elvis’ doctor James F.

Neal), from the firm of Neal & Harwell in Nashville, Tennessee. The co-counsel approach for the trial as yet did not seem threatening to Braun’s position. Dershowitz himself, already a consultant on the case, told Braun that he wanted to come out to Hollywood and assist in doing research while Braun handled the courtroom staging. Dershowitz said he had a semester coming at Harvard when he would be off. Meanwhile, Behr only kept Braun informed of a limited number of the legal maneuvers on the case. But while gradually easing out his chief criminal counsel, Behr did, however, keep him informed of one unique group of public opinion experts he had consulted to help project a better image of their client. They were three psychologists, Dr. Robert Buckout, Dr. Eli Baker, and Dr. Allen Lichtenstein. Analyzing Landis’ potential image before a jury, they consulted about issues such as the impact on a jury of conflicting testimony, a jury’s possible view of the contradictory theories concerning the cause of the crash, and “the myths which have been perpetrated in the news media concerning very damaging statements and evidence.” Informed by Behr that Landis planned to argue a defense based mainly on the issue of “unforeseeability,” one of the psychologists responded by proposing the legal tactic of questioning the memory of hostile witnesses concerning events that had occurred nearly five years before. On the subject of Landis’ public image, the psychologists stressed that in order to have the greatest impact on public opinion it was necessary to bring out “positive information” in the media, presenting Landis as an individual and not “a representative of the Hollywood director profession.” All of the opinion experts believed that Landis had been hurt by earlier statements attributed to him in the press, resulting in the “impression that Mr. Landis is somehow immature.” However, Dr. Buckout made it clear that the jury would decide on Landis’ motives on the basis of his own testimony on how “he can account for his own personal human feelings about this event.” After reviewing the findings of the opinion experts, Behr decided that the phalanx needed an even more detailed blueprint for developing a winning trial strategy.

He next turned to another unorthodox legal group run by professional jury experts to help determine beforehand the eventual outcome of the trial. This expensive new legal service involved the use of highly successful simulated trial techniques to learn the strengths and weaknesses of the case and how to measure potential jurors’ attitudes. Billing themselves as specialists in picking a winning jury, they helped give their customers a better understanding of how jurors perceived cases and made decisions. Of this controversial approach Braun was not informed. All he heard every so often were cryptic reports that the “juries” liked the “plan.”The organization Joel Behr hired consisted of high-tech law consultants from Northern California called the National Jury Project (NJP). The jury experts used “social science methods” in juror research and their glossy advertising brochures promised winning results for the defendant. According to the sales hype, they could even identify the “juror most likely to take over in deliberation and press other jurors for a verdict in your favor or against.” Braun was told the National Jury Project charged the Landis group $80, 000 for the “mock trials” and “focus groups,” the most modern social science techniques in winning with juries. In the mock trials conducted by the NJP both sides of the case were argued in a courtroom atmosphere to a carefully screened panel of “mock jurors.” The arguments were presented by actors who played roles portraying the parties, the witnesses, opposing counsel and the judge. While the mock jurors deliberated the issues candidly, they were video-taped from behind one-way mirrors so that the lawyers could watch how the “jurors” analyzed the case. For more detailed information the project used “focus groups,” small groups of mock jurors that focused on the weak and strong elements of a case. They were to evaluate which argument would have most influence on real jurors. Understandably, not all of the results were positive, some were even disturbing. The focus groups identified the issue of the children as the paramount problem for the defense. It was found that when the mock jurors made their analysis from a strictly legal stand-point, they leaned toward letting Landis off on counts 1, 3 and 5, the reckless manslaughter charges. But they had a less easy time, it was found, with the child endangerment charges based on counts 2 and 4. On that issue the mock jurors were not disposed to forgive the director. The consensus of the mock jurors’ attitudes on the child endangerment was, “This guy did something wrong. We’ve got to get him for something.” The jury experts found, however, that the", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634243667_cleaned.txt:253:a81d35709f6e", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 1857, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634243667_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634243667", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634243667_cleaned", "chunk_index": 254, "text": "leaned toward letting Landis off on counts 1, 3 and 5, the reckless manslaughter charges.

The consensus of the mock jurors’ attitudes on the child endangerment was, “This guy did something wrong. We’ve got to get him for something.” The jury experts found, however, that the focus groups were prepared to absolve the film makers provided they could show that the final scene was “rehearsed and well-planned.” Once the mock jurors heard about a “plan” they would acquit. The plan would prove that the film makers had taken the necessary caution and abided by the standards that prevailed in the industry. he setback dealt Braun by Judge Ringer’s restoration of all five counts left open one last legal remedy. In order to have the charges dismissed before going to trial Braun tried to get the Cal ifornia Supreme Court to hear the argument. Harvard’s Alan Dershowitz was put to work on the petitions going up to the state’s highest legal body. A few months later the court voted by a narrow margin not to review the petitions. The legal system offered no further recourse; the phalanx had exhausted it; even with Dershowitz’s name the effort failed. John Landis would have to face trial on all five counts. During this period in the spring of ^(′)85 , while Landis was busy with post-production work on Spies Like Us, his rift with Wingo grew wider. Despite a recent agreement between the two sides to “avoid any cross-fire” and refrain from attacking one another, Wingo’s attorney, Eugene Trope, filed a brief that was tantamount to a declaration of war with Landis. Essentially it boiled down to holding Landis alone responsible for the accident. The thrust of Trope’s argument was that the helicopter pilot never intended to be on the set at the time the fatal special effects were being detonated. Trope argued in his brief that Wingo had understood there was a “safety plan” in which the helicopter was to be used in an “off screen” role positioned at the far side of the river away from the village at the same time the special effects were activated. Trope’s brief caused a furor in the offices of the other defense lawyers. Harland Braun fired off a copy to Dershowitz’s Harvard Law School office. Branding the arguments “dishonest,” he sought to counteract Trope’s allegations, recommending to Dershowitz that a supplement be filed to the Supreme Court.

The simple reason for this was that the scene was to be of the helicopter firing down upon the village and the actors as they made their escape across the river. In addition, there was a spotlight shining down from the helicopter which was to create the appearance of the enemy helicopter searching out the fleeing actors as they made their escape. Such a scene would have been impossible if, as claimed by Mr. Trope, the helicopter was to be stationed far across the river at the time the scene was being filmed. For their own satisfaction, however, they rejected the pilot’s insistence that the blowing-up of the village was not to occur until his helicopter was a safe distance away, citing one of Wingo’s NTSB statements as proof of his knowledge that the helicopter was to be near the village shoreline when the special effects were set off. The memo quoted Wingo insofar as he had admitted using the third explosion as a cue to begin his lefthand turn away from the riverbank [“I would begin a left-hand turn… so he (Allingham) could keep the light shining on them as they made their escape, and then the final set of explosions would take place.”] This the phalanx indignantly memorialized as showing that the pilot knew that the helicopter would be in the special-effects flames (the “final set of explosions”) and not on the “other side of the river.” Landis’ lawyers simply had to oppose Trope. During Landis’ NTSB appearance three years before, the director had said nothing of the “other side of the river.” When the final set of explosions went off, according to Landis’ earliest account, the helicopter was not on the other side. “Everything was going as I assumed it would,” Landis had told Llorente. The summer of ^(′)85 was again a busy season for the Landis- Folsey team. Landis was huddling with Orion Pictures in a joint HBO venture for his next film, Three Amigos, which like Animal House, was a resurrection of the old Saturday Night Live gang of a decade ago. Landis’ director’s fee was just under $2 million. The picture, overburdened with above-the-line expenses, was typical of the brand name “star” syndrome, with Chevy Chase getting $4 million, Steve Martin $3 million, and Hollywood newcomer also from Saturday Night Live, Martin Short, just under $1 .5 million.

In the third summer since the Twilight Zone incident, as pretrial pressure built, John Landis began to expand his active role in the defense. His lawyers had to make some critical decisions following the State Supreme Court’s vote not to hear his petition. They had to finalize a trial strategy and decide who would finally represent Landis and try the case before the jury. The young director’s new activist role began with the summoning of private investigator Robert Frasco. When Frasco arrived at the Universal bungalow the bearded director and Folsey were in the cutting room with Elmer Bernstein, putting the last musical touches to the soon-to-be released Spies Like Us. Landis’ active new role was evident in the ambitious selection process for a new criminal attorney that had gone on without Braun’s knowledge. John Landis personally consulted with Harvard’s Dershowitz. It was like an old-fashioned talent search except infinitely more difficult. There were very few criminal lawyers who combined the ability to be persuasive in front of a jury while also able to do their homework on a case that was highly complicated, technically intricate, and massively voluminous. “It required an ability to turn a very technical case into something that was understandable and presentable to a jury,” Dershowitz noted. The list of prospects Landis eventually came up with was predictably short. “By the time the list came to me Jim Neal was the leading candidate,” recalled Dershowitz. “He was the perfect choice.” James Neal was in his robust mid-fifties. Compact like a bantam boxer, short but with a great deal of aplomb, he spoke with a musical Southern lilt. He looked like a successful preacher, perfectly tailored, with silvery grey hair and a disarming “aw-shucks” way of speaking. He was known not so much by name but as a high hitter who won acquittals in famous cases. In the courtroom he combined these charms with an outsized cigar that remained unlit and a way of strutting while twirling a pair of glasses. Neal had been involved in two of the most controversial cases during the past two decades, as a prosecutor at Watergate and as the famous criminal defense lawyer in the Pinto proceedings, in which Ford Motor Company executives were acquitted of charges stemming from the deaths of several victims in exploding Pintos. Neal rose to prominence as a lawyer during the Kennedy years. He was one of the few Southern Democrats who became close to the Kennedys.

Neal rose to prominence as a lawyer during the Kennedy years. He was one of the few Southern Democrats who became close to the Kennedys. He first came to national attention in the early 60s after being handpicked by Bobby Kennedy to prosecute Jimmy Hoffa (who called Neal the “most vicious prosecutor” he’d ever seen.) In 1968 James Neal worked with Bobby Kennedy as a “law and order Democrat” to secure Bobby’s position as presidential candidate. Neal’s reputation as a tough prosecutor in the Hoffa case earned him his Watergate appointment, and after his return to private practice with the Nashville firm of Neal & Harwell he soon ranked as the leading criminal lawyer in the South, if not the country, with clients ranging from bankers and businessmen to those high in political office, as well as in his own backyard of the Nashville entertainment world. Among his clients were Elvis’ Dr. Nichopoulos, country and western singers Johnny Cash, Waylon Jennings and Barbara Mandrell, and a governor, Edward Edwards of Louisiana (charged with a scheme of making $10 million on a hospital development business). Landis and Behr were faced with the task of breaking the news to Harland Braun very gracefully so as not to damage the case. When because of personal problems with Folsey’s lawyer at the time, it became Folsey’s turn to obtain a new lawyer, Braun was enlisted to look for possible candidates. At one point, Braun suggested, “Let me take over for Folsey,” but Behr insisted that he remain co-counsel for Landis. “That’s when I knew it was over,” Braun realized. “It didn’t make any sense.” The talk about the co-counsel role abruptly ceased following a cool exchange that took place when Braun and Neal met for the first time at Behr’s office in the summer of ‘85. Braun did most of the talking, repeating that it didn’t make any sense. “You’re not going to handle my briefcase. I’m not going to handle yours. One of us has got to be clearly superior to the other. Who’s going to do the closing argument?” The antagonism and suspicion of that first exchange never completely disappeared. Braun said he told Neal that if he took the case Braun would not be co-counsel; he’d rather switch to representing Folsey. Not long after that meeting Braun learned that, while he would be taking over Folsey’s defense, he would for an interim period continue to represent Landis in order to finish up the on-going discussions with the DA before the trial. Braun decided to make a last grandstand play with the DA’s office to dispose of the case.

Braun decided to make a last grandstand play with the DA’s office to dispose of the case. It was a bold move and had it succeeded it would have eliminated the need for the Tennessee lawyer or for any counsel whatsoever, for the case would not have been brought to trial. With the Supreme Court decision having given clear proof that every legal technicality was exhausted, Braun fixed his sights on a second plea-bargain attempt. In a strange coincidence a development paralleling Braun’s removal from lead lawyer on the Landis team was in progress in the DA’s office, with results for the case that would be even more far-reaching. The central figure in this bureaucratic drama was the prosecutor, Gary Kesselman, who since his El Gaucho fiasco had not been very active on the case. Because of the Supreme Court writs, the case had been in a dormancy stage and Kesselman had not really locked horns with Braun since Judge Ringer’s decision. When Kesselman next met Braun it was in the summer of ^(,)85 at a pretrial status conference in front of Judge Arturio Munoz. Kesselman learned from Braun two remarkable items. The first was that Braun would be coming off the case representing Landis, the other that as a last move on his client’s part he brought a plea-bargain proposal. Braun laid his proposal before Judge Munoz to “dispo” the case without wasting valuable court time in a lengthy trial. He roughed out the idea that his client would be willing to plead guilty to lesser felonies. At this point Judge Munoz suggested they “conference” on that. Kesselman immediately took it up with his superiors who, suspecting that Braun might have a trick up his sleeve, reacted cautiously. The prosecutor was directed by the office’s top brass not to negotiate with Braun. He was only to listen to his proposal and then bring it back to them. Kesselman returned with these instructions to his office on the 16th floor of the Criminal Court building. Tom Budds was present along with Harland Braun and a couple of other defense lawyers. They dragged in extra chairs and formed a ring around Kesselman’s crowded desk. To utter silence Braun offered to plead Landis et alia guilty on felony counts of hiring the children.

In Kesselman’s mind the meeting represented a breakthrough. The first plea arrangement he himself had tried to work out a year earlier had been rejected by Joel Behr. Under Braun’s renewed proposal, the guilty plea again would have limited impact on the civil lawsuits. Like the earlier “dispo” talks between Kesselman and Joel Behr, the charges that would form the basis of the guilty plea would specifically avoid the negligence issue, leaving that question open to argument in the civil cases of the Chens and Les. In conveying Braun’s offer Kesselman met with Gil Garcetti, next in command to LA District Attorney Ira Reiner, the third DA to wrangle with the case since its filing in 1982. After hearing Kesselman repeat that the Twilight Zone defendants wished to plead guilty to felonies, Garcetti excitedly urged Kesselman to draft a memo to Ira Reiner himself, outlining the legal issues and explaining the facts. Not long afterwards, in the latter part of the summer of ^(′)85 , on the eve of the trial, Kesselman was summoned to a high-level meeting with chief DA Ira Reiner, his deputy Garcetti and other ranking deputies to present Braun’s plea-bargain proposal. The meeting was held in Reiner’s office. Before it began Garcetti announced to the gathering that Ira Reiner “is not present at this meeting,”a clear sign to Kesselman that the district attorney wished to distance himself publicly from the case. Taking the floor, Kesselman explained why he personally supported Braun’s proposal. He tried to convince Reiner that if Braun’s very technical “delamination theory” should be challenged by the prosecution, a jury would get caught up in the argument, even though it was not imperative to prove the specific cause of the accident for the manslaughter conviction. A jury would want to know why the helicopter crashed, he reasoned, and delamination would help the defense in showing that the crash was caused by a unique occurrence, creating the appearance of an act of God rather than an act of negligence – in other words, it was unforeseeable. Kesselman pointed out that the prosecutor’s “debris” theory, in the face of delamination, would have hard going before a jury; if it could not be backed up it would taint the rest of the prosecution case; debris meant it was foreseeable. In such an event it would be easier for Braun to prove “unforeseeability”", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634243667_cleaned.txt:259:30bf6c1ae175", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 1863, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634243667_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634243667", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634243667_cleaned", "chunk_index": 260, "text": "caused by a unique occurrence, creating the appearance of an act of God rather than an act of negligence – in other words, it was unforeseeable.

In such an event it would be easier for Braun to prove “unforeseeability” because a crash caused by delamination had never before happened in helicopter history. At the end of his presentation Kesselman remembers Reiner materializing with a speech and with eyes rolling in his massive face, thundering, “What the hell, does anyone care whether it is delamination or debris? You’ve got two dead kids. You’ve got a helicopter. You’ve got explosives. What more do you need?” Despite an adversarial relationship, Gary Kesselman had developed an admiration for Harland Braun. It did not stop Kesselman from suspecting Braun’s hand behind the El Gaucho raid. Kesselman judged him on professional grounds. Harland’s gift was a dynamism of speech, an enormous belief in himself that was infectious. Juries had never seen anything like Harland Braun. He raised the voltage in the courtroom. Kesselman was able to see Braun at his best at a follow-up meeting on the plea-bargain offer that took place on September 23, 1985, in the office of the chief district attorney. Braun’s meeting with Reiner was the last time the DA’s office showed an interest in “dispo”-ing the case short of a trial. Kesselman’s stature in the case was by then at its lowest ebb. The El Gaucho affair darkened all his official relations. His support for a plea-bargain expressed at the secret meeting with Reiner and Garcetti turned out to be unforgivable in the eyes of his superiors. He experienced a rapidly deteriorating relationship with his immediate superior, Richard Hecht. In one such encounter Kesselman told Hecht he had received a call from Harland Braun in which Braun gave astonishing details about the secret meeting where Reiner was not even supposed to be present. Kesselman accused Hecht of leaking the information to Braun. Shortly afterwards, Braun went over Kesselman’s head and arranged his own meeting with Reiner. At this very rare occurrence, when the chief district attorney meets with the lawyer for a criminal defendant, Kesselman attended merely to observe; he was again humiliated with the emphatic instruction not to make any remarks. Braun and Reiner, equal in age, were also political colleagues active in the same local Democratic Party circles. Braun described the Landis segment of the film as being concerned with racism and social injustice. But he saved the most telling hammer blows for last.

Squaring off before Reiner, he proclaimed that the case was bigger than John Landis. He charged Reiner with missing the big fish. Braun pointed out dramatically what it was really about. “Where are they?” he demanded, referring to Steven Spielberg and Frank Marshall. “Where the hell are they? Why hasn’t the DA’s office interviewed these people? Steven Spielberg was co-producer, Marshall was executive producer. Marshall participated in meetings in which the hiring of the children was discussed. Your office says he was never questioned.” Braun ridiculed the idea that the district attorney’s office was unable to find Marshall. “It must be assumed,” Braun declared, “that Spielberg had full and complete knowledge of all that had taken place that night.” As Braun continued, Kesselman for the first time heard Kathleen Kennedy mentioned by name. He learned that Kennedy was herself an associate producer on the Spielberg segment of the film. According to Braun, she had been deeply involved in the decision to employ the children without permits and had been present on the set the night of the crash, yet she was never interviewed. Braun argued that the breadth of the participation of so many people destroyed the credibility of the DA’s charge that there was a foreseeable danger. The meeting ended with Reiner telling Braun that his office would consider the proposal further. But after Braun left, the chief DA turned to Kesselman and asked him to prepare a response to Braun’s arguments and, in addition, to draft a letter asking Harland Braun to identify those areas in the case where he thought the DA was deficient. Kesselman replied incredulously, “You’ve got to be kidding. You want me to send a letter to Harland asking what we missed in the case?” He told Reiner that it would only create undesirable publicity. “That’s going to appear tomorrow on the front page of the LA Times,” he promised, “and give Braun a chance to shove it up your nose.” Reiner insisted, and after brooding for days Kesselman at last composed the draft, which was later sent to Braun’s office and, just as he had forecast, eventually resulted in a media coup for Braun. Kesselman’s growing lack of enthusiasm was interpreted by his superiors in the DA’s office as a lack of conviction for the case.

Kesselman had earlier raised it with Reiner’s assistant, Garcetti, as possibly being an obstacle to his job as prosecutor. Kesselman never hid the fact that he continued to own an interest in El Gaucho. He had even suggested the possibility of being removed, as the embarrassing taxi-dance business could trip him up again. For some time, he was spared any direct reference to it from his chiefs until one day Garcetti mentioned that his continuing involvement in the dance club might taint the Twilight Zone case. On the eve of the trial the most recent LA court drama to gainnational notoriety in LA had been the DeLorean cocaine trial.The case against DeLorean seemed watertight. There was even film recording the defendant in the criminal act. DeLorean’s acquittal, however, taught the DA’s office that there were two juries, in effect, one in the courtroom and the other in the hallway outside where the prosecutor and the defense lawyers talk to the press. It was in the latter forum that Howard Weitzman, DeLorean’s defense counsel, had won his case, in contrast to the federal prosecutors who had adopted the strategy of not responding to the media. The Twilight Zone trial, like the DeLorean, was a high-profile event that promised national attention to be focused on the DA’s office. After taking a first step, the decision to remove Gary Kesselman, the district attorney began looking for someone who was a sharp trial lawyer capable of preventing another “DeLorean,” where the case was lost in the press. Ira Reiner’s chief deputy, Gil Garcetti, was responsible for the search. But as he tried his luck in the downtown office he encountered unexpected resistance. One experienced prosecutor turned him down because Garcetti wouldn’t tell him why Kesselman was being taken off the case. Garcetti had to extend his search to the DA’s 23 outlying offices, in one of which he found Lea D’Agostino. Garcetti didn’t have to ask her twice. She jumped at the chance. A prosecutor for 41/2 years in the San Fernando Valley’s suburban Van Nuys office, Lea Purwin D’Agostino had the impeccable record of never having lost a case. She was 48 years old and worked in the Career Criminal Division as a prosecutor in the sexual assault program, dealing with rapes, incest, child molestation and sexual abuse in children. By comparison to other women in the DA’s office she had reached a very high level – grade IV – in a very short time.

By comparison to other women in the DA’s office she had reached a very high level – grade IV – in a very short time. She was known as a hard-working and high-energy person. She was also known to have Hollywood connections. The story circulating in the DA’s office was that Peter Sellers had once asked her to marry him. Lea D’Agostino’s personnel file showed Gil Garcetti that she had come relatively late to the legal profession. She was 31 when she enrolled at the University of West Los Angeles School of Law. But more interestingly, perhaps, the file showed that she had worked as a top-level executive secretary and administrative assistant for many big Hollywood names, such as David O. Selznick, the producer of Gone with the Wind, and Freddie Fields, the famous theatrical agent and for a period the president of MGM, who represented Judy Garland and Paul Newman as well as Peter Sellers, with whom Lea’s name would become romantically linked. She had also been a secretary to David Begelman, the future 20th Century Fox chief to be tried by the DA’s office on charges of embezzlement. Her file further showed that she had already won considerable local fame by prosecuting the fanatical Croatian terrorist known as the “Alphabet Bomber” who in 1980 carried out a bombing attack on LA International Airport, resulting in several deaths. In the courtroom she was known for a fiery style and as someone who couldn’t be pushed around. The Alphabet Bomber bestowed on Lea D’Agostino the epithet of the “Dragon Lady.” Yet she was pint-sized, barely 5 ft., a mere 90 pounds, frail and angular as a bird with a high delicate forehead accentuated by a towering black upswept beehive. Lea D’Agostino was not Italian, as her name and appearance might imply, but actually a Sabra, born in Tel Aviv, the only child of a Lithuanian mother and Polish father who left Europe on the eve of World War II, in which members of both sides of the family eventually perished. Her father died in Tel Aviv when she was five. A year later she moved to Birmingham, England, after her mother married a British soldier (acquiring the “Purwin” featured in the full name). Six years later her mother divorced and took her daughter to Chicago. Vague residues remained of these early wandering years, strengthening the impression that Lea Purwin D’Agostino was someone from another place, and perhaps from another time. In Chicago, attending an all-girl high school, she showed a strong interest in drama.

Vague residues remained of these early wandering years, strengthening the impression that Lea Purwin D’Agostino was someone from another place, and perhaps from another time. In Chicago, attending an all-girl high school, she showed a strong interest in drama. Her idol was Ingrid Bergman. Because of her deep voice, at school she always played men’s parts. She lost out on a possible career, getting turned down when trying out for a radio advertisement because she sounded “too much like Lauren Bacall.” She briefly attended Northwestern University in Chicago and then moved with her mother to Los Angeles where she found work as a secretary in an investment banking firm. Hard work as a secretary eventually opened the doors to the entertainment world. She found employment in the industry as an administrative assistant of high-powered efficiency and marvelous organizational skills. She was a whizz at shorthand, a fury at dictation, a paramount system maker; all of which became valuable later in mastering the complexity of the Twilight Zone case. The secretarial-administrative route led to several other jobs where she rubbed shoulders with Hollywood people. She was manager of a trendy night club visited by high-rollers like Frank Sinatra; known as The Factory, it was owned by eight of Hollywood’s most prominent high-lifers, including Pierre Salinger, Sammy Davis Jr., Paul Newman and film director Richard Dormer. At this hot spot she was known for her Halloween parties, once winning a prize as Marie Antoinette. At The Factory she also met her husband, Joseph D’Agostino, who was in food services; they were married in 1975. For a while she worked as a social director at LA’s Marina City Club. One day, while thumbing through career ads in TV Guide, she simply made up her mind to go to law school. Lea Purwin D’Agostino was regarded as an oddity in the DA system. She was an amalgam of realist and dreamer, the pragmatist who could still lose herself in the fantasy of Hollywood. She had superstitions and observed certain rituals. She kept off freeways, driving everywhere by surface roads. She pinned golden good luck bees to her right shoulder when giving opening statements or receiving verdicts. During trials she always carried six felt-tip blue pens, a habit retained from her first law school exam when the six pens helped her do extraordinarily well. She had another superstition about not wearing the same outfit twice during a trial. Consequently, her wardrobe never ceased to amaze the courtroom with its inexhaustible variety. She brought to the judicial sessions a dash of flamboyance with sometimes expensive, high-fashion clothing.

She brought to the judicial sessions a dash of flamboyance with sometimes expensive, high-fashion clothing. When she first received the telephone call from Garcetti inviting her downtown for a meeting she thought that because of her work in the sexual assault program she might be made head of the unit. In Garcetti’s office she met Richard Hecht, the head of special trials, and after the two men explained the Twilight Zone case they discussed her Hollywood background and how the case would have to be handled in the media. They didn’t want another DeLorean situation. They asked her whether she had any health or vacation problems that might interfere with a lengthy trial. Hecht, a dour-looking bureaucrat, made a point of querying whether her high-fashion style could become an issue with the jury. Lea assured the towering 6 ft. 5 figure of Hecht, to her own scant 5 ft., that jurors liked the way she dressed. Hecht asked her whether she wanted an assistant. Lea declined, saying that all she wanted was someone from the DA’s Appellate Division to be available to do legal research. It was then that she learned that a mysterious high-powered legal talent from the east would shortly arrive and take over Landis’ defense. The DA’s two top men instructed Lea on the official policy regarding Gary Kesselman. His removal had nothing to do with the merits of the case, Lea remembered Garcetti telling her, and that if asked about Kesselman being replaced she would say he was being relieved for personal reasons. She was not told the reason for his removal, but she was soon given a hint of the true story of Kesselman’s backdoor treatment in a telephone call she received from him personally just after she got the news of her exciting new assignment. At first, she thought Kesselman merely called to confirm that she had taken over the case. He spoke in a strange tone, however, and the way he asked her about the assignment, using Tom Budds as a pretext, sounded fishy. She decided to hold her discussions with Garcetti about her new assignment confidential and stonewalled. In response to the DA’s unorthodox request that he identify the prosecutor’s weak points, Landis’ criminal lawyer drafted a seven-page letter outlining 16 areas where the DA’s case fell short. Predictably, it made for shattering reading but what made it sensational was Braun’s charge that Steven Spielberg, Frank Marshall, Kathleen Kennedy and the executives of Warner Bros., had been able to escape a “consciously truncated investigation.” When leaked to the press, the", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634243667_cleaned.txt:265:6a287dd1c042", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 1869, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634243667_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634243667", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634243667_cleaned", "chunk_index": 266, "text": "Garcetti about her new assignment confidential and stonewalled.

Predictably, it made for shattering reading but what made it sensational was Braun’s charge that Steven Spielberg, Frank Marshall, Kathleen Kennedy and the executives of Warner Bros., had been able to escape a “consciously truncated investigation.” When leaked to the press, the “Spielberg letter” injected the world’s most famous director publicly into the controversy for the first time since the earliest days of the crash. The media had a field day depicting a DA fumbling with a case that had 16 glaring holes in it, the largest of which concerned Hollywood’s top director and one of Hollywood’s top studios. News that the Spielberg letter with its highly volatile legal name-calling had been sent to the DA’s office sent shock waves through a number of offices in Century City. The immediate response came in Folsey’s voice nearly breaking as he called Harland Braun from a restaurant where he was dining with John Landis and Joel Behr, whimpering, “I have to fire you because of the letter.” The day following the letter’s release, James Neal’s assistant, attorney James Sanders from the Nashville firm, dispatched a letter speaking for John Landis to the district attorney, repudiating Braun’s broadside as objectionable, Sanders informed the DA that a formal substitution request would soon be made to replace Braun as Landis’ counsel. In the end Braun was not fired. He remained Folsey’s lawyer, even though the letter that dragged Warner and Spielberg into the fray remained unforgivable. For a while it lingered as a sore spot between Braun and his new client. Braun was puzzled by Folsey’s criticism and maintained that he had cleared the Spielberg letter. “Obviously,” Braun reasoned, “they’d gotten to him,” referring to Folsey’s panic-stricken telephone call from the restaurant. “Behr must have gone to him and told him, ‘You’re gonna be ruined in Hollywood.’” With a new attorney appearing in the case for John Landis, the trial was granted a continuance for another six months in order to give Neal time to prepare himself. Reviewing the volumes of statements and testimony, James Neal remained in the Neal & Harwell offices in one of the more prestigious of the downtown Nashville bank buildings. He had only recently married a former Miss Tennessee, a stunning belle twenty years his junior. Except for brief jaunts to the Three Amigos set in California to talk strategy, Neal sent his assistant, short, affable, diligent Jim Sanders, to smoggy Los Angeles in the early part of 1986 to do most of the background work for the trial.

From Nashville, Neal established phone contact with Landis’ private eye Robert Frasco and, assisted by Behr’s John Diemer on the California side, he outlined the new legal strategy to defend the director. In a departure from Braun’s emphasis on the highly technical “delamination” defense, Frasco was briefed about the findings by the focus groups of the National Jury Project and the problems with the case. Neal laid out a program of working with witnesses in which Frasco would function, in Frasco’s own words, as a “hostility reducer.” Neal explained that he and Frasco would divide up which witnesses each would see. Neal had the “priority list” with the more important names he considered key to the defense: Elie Cohn, Anderson House, Gary McLarty, Kathryn Wooten and Jerry Williams. Frasco was to interview other key witnesses, like Steve Lydecker, many the same as those he had interviewed three years before. Through discussions with Behr and with his own righthand man Jim Sanders, Neal narrowed the issues to problem areas raised by witnesses. Apart from flushing out issues like live ammunition and alcohol on the set, Frasco was told to talk to witnesses who said Landis “disappeared” immediately after the accident. The detective was asked to identify crew members who’d witnessed certain damaging statements made by the director just before the crash. “Anybody you can get who can put a better light on ‘You haven’t seen anything yet,… anything that softens that,” Neal instructed. Neal’s approach to the case was evident in his instructions to the “hostility reducer” in Los Angeles. He explained to Frasco how a body he called “jury pickers,” the National Jury Project’s focus groups, had shown that they had to prove to a jury that the fatal scene was well-rehearsed and wellplanned. Frasco was instructed to look for people who were around during the 2 : 00A.M . copter flight and who could testify to the “seriousness of that rehearsal.” These witnesses would have to testify that the flight was really a planning session, or in Neal’s own words, that “it wasn’t a frivolous thing.” They would have to be able to state that the entire fatal scene was planned in this so-called rehearsal; that it “was a real run-through,” Neal stressed. Frasco was further instructed to look for suitable people who had talked to the parents of the children or had assisted them. Neal told the private eye to identify witnesses who should be able to say of the parents in court, “They are very sophisticated people. They spoke good", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634243667_cleaned.txt:267:d817b8efa029", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 1871, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634243667_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634243667", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634243667_cleaned", "chunk_index": 268, "text": "wasn’t a frivolous thing.” They would have to be able to state that the entire fatal scene was planned in this so-called rehearsal; that it “was a real run-through,” Neal stressed.

Neal told the private eye to identify witnesses who should be able to say of the parents in court, “They are very sophisticated people. They spoke good English. They weren’t intimidated.” As to this particular witness category, Frasco was told to enroll the name of the women’s wardrobe supervisor, Sue Dugan, a friend of Deborah Landis and her subordinate on the set that night who had spent time with the children while they were being kept hidden from Tice. James Neal blew into town on the eve of the trial in the late spring of 1986. He set up headquarters at the Beverly Comstock on Wilshire Blvd in Westwood, about a mile from Behr’s office in Century City. There Frasco met John Landis’ “gray-haired eminence” for the first time, faceto-face. Neal reiterated to Frasco to help communicate to witnesses the defense argument that there was a plan for the fatal scene but that it was not followed correctly. Frasco was surprised at this latest twist. He recalled of his own participation in the early stages, “In the beginning no one wanted to hear about a plan because it meant that if you had a plan something went wrong.” Nonetheless, by the first weeks of the summer of 1986 he had helped set the stage for Neal’s master strategy. Shortly after his next meeting with Neal in Joel Behr’s office, the detective informed Neal that he’d confronted many of the key “unfriendlies” and had done his best to soften up the most “hardened.” At this point Neal’s chief role was that of the elder statesman who persuades his wrangling cohort to get behind “the plan.” The most difficult was Eugene Trope; Wingo’s lawyer criticized Landis’ choice of a Southern lawyer. (“You go to Nashville when you want a banjo player,” Trope huffed, loathe to acknowledge Neal’s “Watergate” credentials). Harland Braun, by virtue of his skills and reputation, had tremendous influence on the lawyers for two of Landis’ co-defendants, Leonard Levine representing Dan Allingham, and Arnold Klein representing Paul Stewart. Levine and Klein actually officed together in the same Century City tower down the hall from Braun and they all shared the same secretary. Jim Neal and his assistant Jim Sanders together visited Braun in his office to convince him of the necessity of arguing “the plan.” As Neal sketched it, the plan involved a scenario in which the helicopter was not supposed to be near or over the village when the special effects were detonated in the fatal scene.

That plan was interrupted, according to Neal, only because of the premature ignition by special effects man James Camomile. Neal’s scenario was largely adapted from the statements recorded in the NTSB record four years earlier from ‘E’ cameraman Roger Smith. They were statements related to what Smith believed the helicopter’s position would be during the scene at the time the village went up. After hearing Dan Allingham give assurances to the mutinous airborne camera crew that the helicopter would move away from the village before it exploded, Smith had told the NTSB that it was then, just before they boarded the fatal flight, that he, Smith, suggested that after photographing the first set of explosions in the village the helicopter could become a “camera platform” to film the final explosions. Harland Braun told Neal he had never heard of this scenario in all his four years on the case, pointing out that besides Roger Smith, neither Landis, Folsey nor Allingham had ever mentioned to investigators the existence of a plan to have a camera platform. He argued that the idea was both unnecessary and unnecessarily complex. In Braun’s view it could already be shown that there was adequate planning. Besides, no one ever thought you could down a helicopter with special effects. Braun also argued against placing the whole strategy on the impression by one witness of the helicopter’s intended position in the final shot. In the latter part of ‘85, Lea D’Agostino moved from the Career Criminal Division in Van Nuys to a new office set aside for the prosecutor of the Twilight Zone case in the downtown Criminal Court building. Though windowless, it was on the 18th floor with the top brass. The office of Richard Hecht, who would act as her liaison with Chief Ira Reiner, was just down the hall; Reiner’s office was on the same floor. Upon turning over the case, Kesselman had agreed to bring the new prosecutor “up to speed,” and for the next three months, until the early part of ‘86, the Dragon Lady consulted on a daily basis with her predecessor whose office was two floors down.

Kesselman could never be completely rid of some resentment against his replacement. Nevertheless, he did his professional best to fill her in on the myriad facts and facets of the case, the movie terms, the variety of witnesses. He advised his successor to concentrate on Donna Schuman. He described her as the best witness because of her former friendship with George Folsey Jr. and her knowledge of intimate details of the Twilight Zone production. In sharp contrast to Kesselman, the new prosecutor, fired up with gusto, did not see obstacles. Adopting the DA’s view, she didn’t buy Braun’s arguments about delamination or Spielberg. With all of her dramatic, coiffed, high-fashion, bird-like 90 pounds she came on like a gunslinger. She pooh-poohed Kesselman’s tales of mysterious pressures, relegating them to the realm of paranoia. From Tom Budds she learned that Kesselman believed there were leaks in the DA’s office to Harland Braun and that someone in the Landis camp had set up the El Gaucho raid. The new prosecutor felt Kesselman was too frightened of Braun. She also sensed a deep concern in Kesselman about whether she knew why he’d been taken off the case – she had never been told. She guessed that Braun was still going to focus on both delamination – the “unforeseeable” – and the “botched investigation,” claiming that other important people like Spielberg, Marshall and Kathleen Kennedy, as well as a big studio, Warner Bros., knew about the illegal hiring of the children. Her game plan was to outfox the fox, that is, give the impression that she was going to meet Braun head-on in those issues while in actuality her real strategy was to ignore them. She planned a wholly original and unexpected attack. Meanwhile, by the beginning of ‘86 she got fresh support in the form of Jerry Loeb. Pleasant and well-spoken, Loeb looked more like a young executive than an investigator with the DA’s office. Loeb got assigned to the case due to his experience with the “Hollywood crowd,” as he called it. A member of the special Crime Task Force into movieland corruption, he had investigated the Charlie’s Angels case in which the show’s two top executives, Leonard Goldberg and Aaron Spelling, were the subject of a probe as to whether they diverted profits away from their partners in the show, Natalie Wood and Robert Wagner.

Jerry Loeb had worked once before with Lea D’Agostino in a case involving the successful prosecution of one of Mickey Rooney’s lawyers. Loeb’s most notorious case was the 1980 Begelman affair, the investigation into the petty pilfering by a major studio chief that shook up Hollywood. With Jerry Loeb and Tom Budds, two tall good-looking males for escort, the tiny prosecutor became fully acquainted with the Twilight Zone terrain. Here Tom Budds was indispensable; in an investigation that doggedly ran into its fourth year he had amassed a bundle of four spiral-bound notebooks jammed with notations and descriptions. Neatly and patiently, Budds had recorded in hundreds of crowded pages his interviews with witnesses of every stripe, from film experts to stunt people. With the trial six months away, the new prosecutor had to master four years of investigations. Frequently she arrived at her office at 5 a.m. and did not finish work till midnight. She studied not only the Budds’ notebooks, the six volumes of grand jury testimony, over 1,000 pages of single-lined NTSB statements, 20 volumes of preliminary hearings, besides familiarizing herself with the statements of over 100 witnesses, as well as sheaves of technical reports submitted by the NTSB and FBI; she also tried to talk to motion picture insiders. She went to Hollywood, visiting sets in person. On the set of Hill Street Blues, Tom Budds photographed her sitting in the lap of star Daniel Travanti. She visited the Love Boat set. She met with famous directors. She went to Warner Bros. studios and faced down supercilious company lawyers, teaching them that if they thought they had merely to deal with a “civil servant” they had quite another think coming. Over the phone she debated Burt Reynold’s best friend, director/stuntman Hal Needham, who himself was caught up in a controversial lawsuit from a crippled stunt woman. She tried to get movie actor Cliff Robertson to talk about industry blacklisting, and Clint Eastwood to be interviewed as an expert witness about safety standards on the set. The windowless 18th floor office began to resemble a movie production office. At times it was like a remake of the Landis segment.

In practical terms, the new prosecutor’s first official duty was to address the Spielberg letter. Early in ^(′)86 at a meeting with Ira Reiner’s top deputy, Gil Garcetti, she was directed to locate Frank Marshall in order to rebut Braun’s charge that the office hadn’t lifted a finger to find the highest-ranking executive on the set. In taking over the case from two earlier administrations the DA’s top men were themselves unaware as to why Frank Marshall had not been interviewed. They thought it was a good question, especially since they might have to account for a possible oversight committed by their predecessors. Like Tom Budds, Loeb staked out Marshall’s house in Santa Monica to no avail. But he made an interesting discovery. From the security company guarding the house he learned that it listed another address for Frank Marshall in the name of Kathleen Kennedy. Loeb saw the chance to refute the accusation made by Braun in his Spielberg letter that the DA’s office had deliberately omitted questioning Kathleen Kennedy. So, he drove over to the Studio City condo listed as her address. There he found out that all her mail was being forwarded to Spielberg’s Amblin Entertainment at Universal; people in the neighborhood told him that she had not been seen in the area for some time. Following up the lead, Loeb found himself rebuffed at Spielberg’s newly risen mini-studio on the Universal lot. Neither Steven Spielberg nor Kathleen Kennedy, purportedly busy with Joe Dante’s new movie, Innerspace, was available. Bonnie Radford, the TZ production’s accountant who had drafted the “under-the-table” check, was in England working on an Amblin assignment. Finally, after trying normal Amblin channels and being constantly referred to Marshall’s lawyer, Rick Rosen, Loeb decided to cash in a chip from an inside studio contact who still owed him a favor from his Crime Task Force days. As a result, Loeb came back to his boss with the news that Frank Marshall was working on a film named Who Framed Roger Rabbit? at the Elstree Studios in London. The film was being directed by Robert Zemeckis who had just finished directing Back To The Future on which Frank Marshall had also been the executive producer. Scheduled to commence on July 17, the upcoming Twilight Zone trial rippled to London in the latter part of June.

The tabloid’s local stringer who did this story was contacted and enlisted in the search for the vanished witness. At the same time, through official channels, Marshall’s name was also put on the Interpol list. The Sun reporter quickly confirmed through his movie contacts that Frank Marshall was staying at “Number Seven Park Place,” the highly exclusive St. James Club with a largely Hollywood clientele, including Michael Jackson and Steven Spielberg. The newsman reported that Marshall’s stay was very, very quiet. Marshall usually stayed at the Atheneum in Picadilly, the man from the Sun said; but most curiously, he didn’t this time. Perhaps Jerry Loeb, a keen history buff, would have felt more at home in the land of tradition. Tom Budds was chilled by the foreignness. In a cool reception from the Scotland Yard inspector, Budds was cautioned not to pull any “Mission Impossible stuff,” which did little to make him feel more at ease. In London the LA cop was a fish out of water. In his quandary Budds ended up at the U.S. embassy where he managed to enlist the assistance of the legal attaché. She was a brisk American lady. Together they went to the exclusive hotel on Park Place where the attaché rang up Frank Marshall in his room. The brisk lady stated that she had a legal document which she wished to serve. Marshall replied that he would be down in a half hour. Budds and the embassy employee waited in the lobby for an unconscionable time. Frank Marshall never came down. Tom Budds later found out from Scotland Yard that Spielberg’s friend and business partner had packed his bags and left by limousine for the airport and taken a plane to Paris. Interpol reported that he met in Paris with Steven Spielberg and Richard Benjamin to promote a new Benjamin movie. There was a question as to whether the plane that took Marshall away belonged to Steven Spielberg. Budds’ failure in London to bring Marshall to heel, though it deprived the pint-sized prosecutor of a possibly sensational coup, did not affect her basic strategy. She privately feared that on the witness stand Marshall might well have ended up supporting John Landis. She realized that Braun’s charge of the “botched investigation” was designed to draw a wider circle, including Hollywood’s biggest director and a major studio in an effort to divert the attention from Landis.

It was this paradox that formed the basis of her strategy – to respond to all of Braun’s challenges on the public relations front while in actuality keeping her focus solely on John Landis and the issue of his personal responsibility as director on the set. As the trial drew near, despite the Hollywood rumor mill and the fear of witnesses about losing their jobs, that focus had become increasingly sharp. Many of her best witnesses were not unlike those she had dealt with on previous assignments, only here drawn from the workaday reality of the movie set: hairdressers, fire safety officers, cameramen, electricians and truck drivers. In their comments she detected a common note of revulsion. Four years after the accident the hostility and anger in those the prosecutor interviewed remained undiminished. She heard repeatedly of the “screamer” and from the descriptions by witnesses became acquainted with an erratic, waving, whining, leaping and cursing tyrant of the set. One witness said the director was “always irrational”; yet another commented that Landis “went apeshit that night.” She heard about the director’s obsession that night to “outdo Apocalypse Now” and “out-Spielberg Spielberg.” In the prosecutor all her maternal instincts rebelled. In her mind the director became a mythical monster who devoured children for the sake of the “shot.” The strong personal attachment she developed with key witnesses like Steve Lydecker, Randy Robinson, Alpha Campbell and the makeup artist Bob Westmoreland, were cited by the Landis defense as proof of female instability. During the trial her unorthodox relationship with Donna Schuman, who also identified emotionally with the children, would be pounced on by Harland Braun and become a dominating issue. As a woman among the all-male defense she was called “over-emotional’’ and brutally blamed for being herself childless. Lea D’Agostino never denied that she identified closely with the deaths of Myca and Renee. She kept photographs of the children. One day in the hallway, after seeing off Dr. Le, she wept, and she wept for the Chens who had lost Renee. Like Llorente she recognized the real crime that had been committed at Indian Dunes. For nearly a year, from mid-July 1986, till the late spring of 1987, thetrial preoccupied the film capital and company town.

It affected Spielberg and his righthand man and studio executives and directors, down to crews, craftsmen, cameramen, union reps and stunt people. It was talked about in the exclusive Colony at Malibu, in the high suites above Sunset, and in the modest homes of the film workers in the Valley. In her representations to the press Lea D’Agostino portrayed this community as unanimously standing behind her, though nothing was further from the truth. Few in Hollywood liked this trial. Many high-level movie people saw the criminal indictments of the five men as an encroachment on artistic freedom. The rank-and-file, conscious of the blacklist, predicted trouble for witnesses who made damaging statements about John Landis and his co-defendants. No eyebrows were raised by the refusal of some of the chief witnesses to be cooperative: that the highest-ranking person on the set fled the country; that the stunt coordinator dodged the prosecutor; that even the accountant stayed out of the country until the end of the trial were in the main, thought of as actions justified by the undue rigor of a legal process aimed at Hollywood as a whole. The prosecutor encountered resistance along more subtle lines from the Newhall Land & Fanning Company; the owner of Landis’ Indian Dunes filming site, at first resisting the court’s request for a jury view of the place where the helicopter had crashed, prompted the judge to consider calling in marshals to secure the location by force. In the case of Universal Studios, which initially denied access to DA investigators, it took a call from the head DA’s assistant Gil Garcetti threatening Universal Chairman Sid Sheinberg with a search warrant. The studio finally allowed investigator Jerry Loeb on the lot to take a photograph of the European street set where the Nazi sequence was shot and Vic Morrow tottered dangerously on a ledge. The chief defendant was a Warner agent. Any damaging information that surfaced in the criminal trial could be used in the still unsettled Le and Chen cases where the studio remained a defendant; and in its efforts to keep distant from the criminal trial, Warner openly resisted key requests from the prosecutor, refusing, for instance, to supply payment records which would clarify its role in bankrolling the legal expenses for John Landis and his co-defendants.

Among Hollywood’s top movie people support for what was merely seen as a beleaguered movie director was strong. No one challenged the issue of the auteur capable of sparking a kind of madness on the set. They simply couldn’t have known, and perhaps wouldn’t have believed it, for not until the trial was underway did a partial picture first begin to emerge of what had transpired at Indian Dunes the night the children and Vic Morrow died. And if the brave, bird-like prosecutor achieved one objective during the judicial proceedings it was that of shocking Hollywood into taking a fresh look at its brilliant wunderkind. Though he had four co-defendants, the trial was ultimately about John Landis – his personality, his reputation, and his responsibility. Before the trial began James Neal filed a series of motions called “limiting,” that is, the limiting of the evidence that can be presented to the jury; and since John Landis faced five counts, Neal filed more such motions for his client than any of the other co-defendants’ lawyers did for theirs. Neal sought to limit evidence of the use of alcohol and live ammo on the set, any photographs of the children or their death scene, as well as any reference to Landis’ conduct on previous movies. The court granted most motions on the basis that they tended to create undue prejudice. Lea D’Agostino did not oppose some of them for motives that were strategic. Thus, she allowed Neal to keep the overwhelming testimony to drinking on the set out of the trial. An admission that alcohol had been used during the filming by the low-echelon SFX crew, she reasoned, would lessen Landis’ share of the blame for the accident. But not to bring before the jury the incredible story of people drinking beer and vodka while firing explosives near children was to omit a devastating portion of the totality of chaos during the final shoot. The problem with a strategy based simply on getting a conviction by proving the director’s responsibility was obvious. It blinkered the prosecutor, forcing her to paint the issues in unrelieved black and white. The failure of this strategy became clear in the trial’s crucial phase when during the jury selection her choice, ironically, turned out identical to that which the “jury pickers” had recommended to Joel Behr.

The failure of this strategy became clear in the trial’s crucial phase when during the jury selection her choice, ironically, turned out identical to that which the “jury pickers” had recommended to Joel Behr. Just days before jury selection began a representative from the National Jury Project visited Los Angeles and addressed the defense lawyers. A late-thirtyish lawyer-like woman by the name of Beth Benaro was introduced to the group that included Braun, Klein and Levine, but excluded Eugene Trope. In light of the consensus arrived at by the “focus groups,” Benaro opted for older people who had more experience with misfortune in life and would be less judgmental, warning the defense lawyers especially against choosing young women jurors. Like Beth Benaro, the prosecutor sought to exclude better educated, upper-middle-class candidates from the selection process, though in the belief that a blue collar-type jury largely comprised of older and minority members, being less sympathetic to the rich and famous aspect of the defense, would not get “hung up” on what she considered technicalities like delamination. Of the final jury selection, eight were minority – one Hispanic, two Filipinos and five blacks; the four white jurors, two women and two men, were all near 60. They had answered to the satisfaction of both the prosecutor and the defense a confidential questionnaire about their movie tastes, what movies they had seen, and in a specific question posed by D’Agostino they had accounted as to their reaction if Hollywood stars showed up in court. The relations between the two sides were by now fixed. All of the suspicion and belittling of purpose, meanness and pettiness, the blackening of character and motive – above all the spectacle of the barking of seven male attorneys and the desperate clawing of one frail, female prosecutor – all the elements were fixed even before the trial began and the succeeding ten months would only repeat the pattern. It was a contest, a kind of psychological warfare, in which the onus was on the tiny Dragon Lady. She had to prove equal to a $5, 000 -day Watergate prosecutor. She had to stand up to the razor-sharp legal mind of Harland Braun. The DA’s office exerted constant pressure to prevent a “DeLorean,” and she showed nerviness very early in the proceedings by firing off a resounding newsmaker. In a daring lunge for the headlines, she served notice on Braun that he had met his media match by telling the press that should she originally have filed the charges against the movie director, it would have been not for manslaughter but 2nd degree murder.

By the time the trial began Lea D’Agostino had gotten to know Harland Braun, James Neal and the other defense lawyers. With none, however, had she established a cordial note except Eugene Trope. The prosecutor knew about the lawsuit filed by Wingo against Landis and this split in the defense made possible her rapport with the elderly Westside lawyer representing the pilot. At 69, the oldest attorney on the defense side, and also, as heir to a prosperous law firm possibly the richest, Trope was avuncular and kind to the new prosecutor. During the early weeks of cordial relations, he informed her of his defense strategy in numerous telephone talks. Now and then he mentioned tidbits about what the Nashville attorney was up to. He was also helpful in other ways. When Trope found out that the prosecutor had not seen certain portions of the film, he invited her to a screening showing footage shot the night before the helicopter crash; D’Agostino watched the children flub their lines, doing and redoing their takes with that pathetic resolve each time to do better. Then suddenly, in the third week of jury selection, the prosecutor broke with Trope. Two events led to her taking this step. The first occurred during Neal’s limiting motions when Trope told her that he was not going to support Neal on excluding the live ammo issue from the evidence, citing as his reason for doing so that he felt such evidence would help Wingo in showing a pattern of Landis’ recklessness. A few weeks later Trope’s inexplicable reversal on this question, ending up supporting Neal, raised the prosecutor’s hackles. She alleged that Trope had told her of having received a call from Neal asking him to get together “and agree upon a story.” She became convinced that Dorcey Wingo was being denied an adequate defense because of his own attorney’s conduct. When the break came it was dramatic. The prosecutor said she “agonized” at having to confront the elderly law figure with the baroque head.

But on August 19, 1986, she nerved herself to make the highly unusual request for a secret meeting with the judge and Trope without the knowledge of the other lawyers. At this hush-hush confrontation in the judge’s chamber Eugene Trope vehemently denied the allegations, maintaining that he changed his position on the live ammo issue independent of Neal’s limiting motion and that he had never discussed coordinating Wingo’s defense strategy with that of John Landis. The secret proceedings ended awkwardly for the prosecutor with the judge doing nothing. On that same day, however, Trope took part in a second meeting. It began informally in his Rolls- Royce while driving to a gathering called by James Neal at Harland Braun’s office. Also in the car was Trope’s assistant, Bill Anderson, who could not remember when the head of the firm had been more upset. Lea D’Agostino had assailed Trope’s legal integrity and wounded his self-esteem. She had imputed to him not only incompetence in representing Dorcey Wingo, in effect, she had called for his removal. The judge, puzzled as to what to do, had ended up sealing the record of the secret meeting. But it was far from sealed for the baroque Westside figure fuming behind the wheel of the Rolls. Anderson recalled that by the time they got to Neal’s meeting, “if the devil himself had walked into the room and proposed a deal against Lea, Gene would have bought.” And so, at that very critical time when the jury selection process was nearing completion, the meeting saw the pilot heal his four-year rift with John Landis. Trope’s earlier explosive encounter with the prosecutor in the judge’s chamber would not become known to the other attorneys present until the end of the trial. Irrepressibly, Lea D’Agostino, six months hence, would make a dramatic attempt at once again trying to pry Wingo away, and though she nearly succeeded, Trope and his client stayed on the Landis side for the remainder of the proceedings. The August 19th conclave in Braun’s office, originally called by James Neal to coordinate the defense among the attorneys and their clients, became with the eleventh-hour accession of the pilot, represented by Eugene Trope, the key strategy session of the entire ten-month-long trial. Except for the sessions in open court, it marked the first time all of the attorneys and defendants were together. Taking the chairman’s role, patiently, with statesman-like cajoleries and craft, Neal forged a loose confederacy based on the importance of having the jury understand that there was a plan. He then proposed that each of the defendants give their recollections of that night. For Wingo, the first speaker, it was also the first time he discussed the case with his co-defendants.

He then proposed that each of the defendants give their recollections of that night. For Wingo, the first speaker, it was also the first time he discussed the case with his co-defendants. And, remarkably, as Wingo gave his version the four other defendants sprang alive with spontaneous interruptions like, “Oh, yeah, I remember that.” Or, “I’m glad you brought that up because I hadn’t.” Particularly when the pilot talked about the 2:00 a.m. flight, the so-called “rehearsal,” he received encouragement as John Landis filled in the gaps. Assuming that Dorcey might not have known it up in his craft, he clarified that the 2 : 00A.M . “rehearsal” was complete. The director told Wingo about Bob Liddle, Vic’s stand-in, and how later, after the “rehearsal,” Vic Morrow himself had walked the path in the water. Neal’s plan had mainly to do with Landis’ three counts of manslaughter related to the negligence issues which affected only Landis, Wingo and Stewart. Predictably, each had a different recollection. Thus, it became the first order to iron out major inconsistencies such as when, according to “the plan,” the various SFX explosions were set to go off. At first Wingo gave his recollection of a plan in which his helicopter was to make a 45-degree turn, circle around and exit the scene on that angle after the shooting had started. James Neal’s plan, in contrast, had the helicopter making a 90-degree turn and moving across the river, thus positioning the aircraft farther away when the village was to be blasted. Nevertheless, a conflict between the pilot and the movie director was instantly averted. “Neal switched the plan at that moment to 45 degrees,” Braun recalled. The new plan was sketched out on a piece of scratch paper and Braun recalled Neal’s prompt, “If you say 45, our plan is 45, too. We can go along with that.” Arnold Klein alone found fault with the crucial part of Neal’s plan according to which the helicopter was to become a camera platform across the river from the village to film the explosions located on the village shoreline. The attorney for Paul Stewart flatly asserted, “It can’t fly,” citing that in all of the various interviews over the previous four years his powdermen had not once mentioned it. But Klein offered that, as opposed to “across the river,” he could live with a plan that put the location of the helicopter at a “safe distance away” when the village was to go up. Both Eugene Trope and James Neal concurred that they could go along with that, Bill Anderson, Trope’s assistant, remembers.

Both Eugene Trope and James Neal concurred that they could go along with that, Bill Anderson, Trope’s assistant, remembers. Neal then passed out a seven-page document, afterwards referred to by some of the attorneys present as “the plan.” A compilation of brief excerpts, it combined Neal’s personal interviews with some of the key eyewitnesses with evidence combed from the statements made by others. It contained one important note: “The only witness we have found to conflict with the plan is Camomile.” While admitting having fired what was generally thought to be the fatal explosive, the “pigeon” had never mentioned that his actions were due to a departure from any plan. If anything, his earlier statements indicated that he had not the least inkling of any plan – a point Arnie Klein duly underscored in his notes. Simply stated, Neal’s “plan” proved that the helicopter crash was a pure accident and that John Landis never intended to put a helicopter over an exploding village. Ironically, just a year before, writing on behalf of the phalanx, Leonard Levine had demonstrated in a memo that the helicopter’s position in such a plan, away from the village when the explosions hit, was “cinematically impossible.” Now, as Neal’s document had it, except for the accidental misfiring by Jimmy Camomile, the helicopter would have been elsewhere. After the meeting Dorcey Wingo went to dinner with Trope and Anderson. The pilot remarked his relief at hearing from Landis that there had been a complete 2 : 00A.M . rehearsal. Bill Anderson observed that the new information appeared to bring comfort to the pilot. Wingo had been “fuzzy” on the purpose of that flight at the time. The Twilight Zone trial opened on July 17, 1986, on the 15th floor, Department 132, of the Criminal Court building in downtown Los Angeles’ Civic Center. With four courtrooms facing a long broad hallway extending in a T-shape from the bank of elevators, the 15th floor was known for high-profile media cases. It was always packed like a bazaar. The door to Department 132 was covered with a number of court orders to regulate people as to how far they had to stand away from the door and where they could sit in the courtroom, as well as a warning against eavesdropping on the conversations between lawyers and clients. The courtroom was divided in three sections. On a platform under the great seal of the state of California sat the judge in his black robe.

In the second section facing him stood a long table that included from left to right Lea D’Agostino with her assistant Tom Budds; Eugene Trope and Dorcey Wingo; John Landis with James Neal and Neal’s assistant Jim Sanders; Folsey’s lawyer, Harland Braun and Allingham’s lawyer, Lenny Levine. Powder chief Paul Stewart sat with his attorney Arnie Klein at a small table to the right of this line-up, separated from the desk of a uniformed LA county sheriff known to the trial regulars as Larry the Bailiff. Presiding over the trial, Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Roger Boren was known as a low-key, no-nonsense judge. Cherubic, balding, on the portly side, he was a Mormon, a Republican and a Vietnam veteran. No stranger to bizarre and protracted trials, before his judicial appointment, while a deputy district attorney with the state’s attorney general’s office, he was co-prosecutor of LA’s two-year-long Hillside Strangler case. Two stenographers, providing a daily transcript, sat in the well before him. Directly to the right of the judge near the door through which he exited sat the clerk who administered the oath to witnesses, kept the court papers and managed the exhibits. The seating arrangement was important to the parties since they played their adversarial role not so much before the judge as to the 12 jurors who sat day after day in a raised box, a gallery with theatre-style seats on the left side of the room. Lea D’Agostino sat nearest them separated by an aisle. Everybody in the courtroom got to know the jurors’ faces. For nearly a year they lived in almost daily contact with the rich and famous, and though the prosecutor had carefully screened them for susceptibility to Hollywood razzle-dazzle, the reality proved too much. However, the jury was hardly alone in being vulnerable to the heightened drama provided by a Hollywood trial. Even James Neal managed to get in a bit of movie-acting, playing a lawyer in an Andy Griffith TV movie while appearing as a real-life lawyer in the Twilight Zone proceedings. Only Judge Boren appeared immune to the Hollywood bug. He endured like a stone effigy the antics of the freewheeling legal body before his bench. Venturing a cautious comment only near the trial’s end, he compared it to a “threering circus” in which he identified the “ring master” as Harland Braun.

In his own fee arrangement with John Landis, James Neal was to be paid directly from Landis’ pocket, with the understanding that the director would be compensated by Warner at a future date. At this time John Landis received $2 million in director’s fees for Three Amigos, a figure said to be close to his $1.7 million in legal expenses. Wingo’s attorney Eugene Trope had his fees paid directly by Houston Casualty. The fees for the attorneys representing Folsey, Allingham and Stewart, respectively Braun, Levine and Klein, had been paid for in combination between Warner and Travelers until the insurance company backed out of the criminal fee payments following the prelim in January 1984. But despite numerous requests by the attorneys that Warner advance them enough to pay the anticipated 4-5 month-long trial, they were still waiting for the studio to pay the money. Joel Behr, since he also represented Folsey and Allingham besides Landis, had agreed with their attorneys, Braun and Levine, to negotiate on their behalf to secure the trial fees. But for reasons that Braun termed “unbelievable” Behr alienated Arnie Klein by refusing in his negotiations with Warner Bros. to include the attorney for the powder chief. Like Trope, Arnie Klein was not party to the nucleus of the defense but became key to “the plan,” just as for different reasons Trope would. For “the plan” to work the inclusion of favorable testimony from the special effects crew was crucial, and only Arnie Klein could deliver them. Paul Stewart, Arnie’s client, was the link to the two key powdermen, Jerry Williams and Jimmy Camomile. Neal had already singled out Camomile as the key witness whose recollections of events that night could make or break “the plan.” Arnie Klein was a small person, as were all the lawyers except Harland Braun, a six-footer. Klein had curly hair and wore black-rimmed glasses and dressed in the odd-matching California style. His young proud wife brought cookies to the trial. Klein had a hip problem that caused him to drag one foot slightly and in other ways he might be said to limp slightly behind the hot-shot lawyers on the team. At this point, however, Neal approached Klein and after a series of discussions about fees assured him that he’d go to Warner’s head counsel, John Schulman. The Nashville attorney gave Klein his personal guarantee that he’d get him the $100, 000 he requested.

Shortly afterward, Neal’s assistant Jim Sanders accompanied Harland Braun to a meeting with Schulman and O’Melveny’s Scott Dunham at Warner’s offices over at TBS. Braun put it in no uncertain terms. If the studio failed to come up with Klein’s $100, 000 , “we’ll lose the powdermen and we’ll all go down the tubes.” The argument was persuasive, and Warner fell into line and agreed to pay. Warner’s strategy was consistent with the overall case strategy conducted by Neal. The outcome of the criminal trial would determine the extent of Warner’s liability in the still unresolved Le and Chen civil lawsuits. Once the trial opened the studio kept close tabs on the courtroom developments, having the daily transcript messengered over to Scott Dunham at the O’Melveny firm in Century City. From Warner Bros. Inc., Braun got paid ($150,000) and Levine ($100,000) , and before the special-effects men took the stand Arnie Klein had been given $123, 400 . James Neal made his entrance in the trial in the opening argument. The drama would not peak again until six months later when John Landis took the stand. A trial, especially a long one, is only interesting in snippets, and professional trial-watchers like the media people who sit through endlessly boring sessions, welcome a “personality.” They were not disappointed in the Southern lawyer with the deceptive aw-shucks manner famous for winning the biggest cases. His opening appearance was the high point of the proceeding. Among the media throng were two veterans who had followed the case since that first eerie excursion to Indian Dunes in the already faded Summer of Spielberg. Andy Furillo, no longer a cub, spoke like a seasoned newsman but he was still the same “carrot-top,” honesty and freckles shining from his face. The other time-traveler from that strange distant summer dominated by E.T., Sandy Kenyon of CNN, still blond and boyish and zestful for the newsman’s chase, had also changed very little. Also among the crowd of television newsmen was Paul Dandridge, the local ABC station reporter and Robert Redford lookalike who would cover the case for the entire ten months. Dandridge became a Landis intimate, though wryly acknowledging even at the height of his favor that he had every expectation that after the trial he would be unceremoniously dropped. Neal’s prepared speech promised the jury his intent to prove that the disaster at Indian Dunes was an accident, a tragic accident, but one that was, in what would become his signature phrase, “unforeseen and", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634243667_cleaned.txt:284:9511d874cf51", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 1888, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634243667_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634243667", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634243667_cleaned", "chunk_index": 285, "text": "station reporter and Robert Redford lookalike who would cover the case for the entire ten months.

Neal’s prepared speech promised the jury his intent to prove that the disaster at Indian Dunes was an accident, a tragic accident, but one that was, in what would become his signature phrase, “unforeseen and unforeseeable.” The jury was told there had been a “complete rehearsal” and “a plan,” and that they would meet two witnesses whose testimony would bear out that had it not been for “unforeseeability,” the “plan” would have come off successfully. Neal did not fail to describe the Landis production as a “Steven Spielberg film,” and, perhaps with an eye to Warner, the “deep pocket,” he brought up the name of Lucy Fisher as a person at Warner who worked with John. If the defense case was like a movie with a financial backer, Warner Bros., a producer, Joel Behr, and a director, John Landis, it had in Neal found the star. From the opening argument until the closing session, he dominated the trial. His speech overshadowed the addresses made by the other lawyers on the team, and although the prosecutor’s response was a model of succinctness and her presentation had great drama, the powerful impression left by James Neal made those who followed him seem anti-climactic. Considering the prosecutor’s lack of experience in a high-notoriety case of the Twilight Zone caliber, she made a very strong opening argument. She focused on the personality of John Landis and on the common-sense notion that no one would put kids near explosions at night under a low-flying helicopter. To prove the director’s share of blame for the accident she informed the jurors that not only would she demonstrate the power of the explosives and the low position of the helicopter but also the role played by the screaming and tyrannical director. She promised to produce witnesses who would testify that Landis’ erratic behavior on the set had created complete chaos and that despite repeated warnings from Andy House and Marci Liroff, Landis, Folsey and Allingham had gone ahead, even though they must have foreseen the possibility of exposing Myca and Renee to unsafe conditions. The prosecutor’s strategy was to start out with either Donna Schuman or Alpha Campbell as the lead witness. Although neither had been on the set that night, and though inadmissible as evidence, they had painted a shocking background in their discussions with the prosecutor. From Alpha Campbell, D’Agostino had heard of the director’s closed-door meetings with a disheveled, drugged John Belushi. Alpha had mentioned to her the silver “snuffer” used to snort cocaine which she found on her desk one day and that when asked, according to Alpha, Landis", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634243667_cleaned.txt:285:bb6ba543a96a", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 1889, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634243667_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634243667", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634243667_cleaned", "chunk_index": 286, "text": "Donna Schuman or Alpha Campbell as the lead witness.

Alpha had mentioned to her the silver “snuffer” used to snort cocaine which she found on her desk one day and that when asked, according to Alpha, Landis said he didn’t know what it was and told her to throw it away. The director’s personal secretary told the prosecutor about Landis’ order to destroy all copies of the script’s third draft and his instructions to her on the morning of the crash to say nothing to anyone and not to send anything over to Warner. But like Kesselman before her, the new prosecutor relied for the most devastating information from Donna Schuman. In recounting the constant joking about the explosives by Landis and Folsey in the Universal bungalow, Donna Schuman gave Lea D’Agostino her strong suit that could prove “foreseeability.” Donna Schuman made a powerful emotional impression on the prosecutor and on September 3, 1986, she appeared in court as the prosecution’s lead witness. he prosecution had developed a kind of shorthand for the case. The bullhorn stood for the whole “lower, lower” business; sim-ilarly, the joking in the Universal bungalow by the two principal defendants about “going to jail” stood for “foreseeability.” But while in the one instance six witnesses stated they saw John Landis use the bullhorn to give the fatal command, only one witness, Cynthia Nigh, had been reported as the source of the incriminating banter about going to jail. By putting on Donna Schuman as the prosecution’s star witness, however, Lea D’Agostino had someone for the first time to corroborate Cynthia Nigh and help her in the trial’s opening testimony fix a shattering impression on the minds of the jurors. “If they find out we’re using the children,” on the stand Mrs. Schuman quoted Folsey, “it’ll be a slap on the wrist, but if they find out about the explosives, they’ll throw our butts in jail.” She described the director at the time as standing down at the other end of the hallway where she observed him throw his arms up and heard him shout, “I want it big! I want it big!” Though the testimony did not fail in impact, an important difference between the statements by the star witness and Cynthia Nigh’s became immediately apparent. Nigh’s depiction of Folsey joking about going to jail existed in transcripts of earlier proceedings and in investigators’ notes. But in contrast, nothing like it had been recorded anywhere from Donna Schuman. And when the defense on cross-examination asked her why, in all of the previous four years, she had never brought up hearing such statements that", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634243667_cleaned.txt:286:25c12850f775", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 1890, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634243667_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634243667", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634243667_cleaned", "chunk_index": 287, "text": "the testimony did not fail in impact, an important difference between the statements by the star witness and Cynthia Nigh’s became immediately apparent.

And when the defense on cross-examination asked her why, in all of the previous four years, she had never brought up hearing such statements that were both dramatic and incriminating, her reply made the courtroom gasp. Astonishment ran through the galleries. In the press section pens dashed to paper as the media men and women scratched out notes that would produce a headline-making story the following day. According to the witness, the prosecutor at the time, four years earlier, had persuaded her to keep it as a surprise for the trial. Deputy DA Gary Kesselman, she testified, warned her not to mention it either at the grand jury or prelim because, in a flat affectless voice she quoted the ex-prosecutor of the case telling her Landis’ lawyers “would kick the crap out of her.” In a sense the prosecutor’s strange experience with the star witness was her real introduction to the Twilight Zone case. It led D’Agostino into the realm of the irrational and conundrum that was its characteristic. The star witness backfired. For if Donna Schuman told the truth, then the DA’s office was at fault for having clearly committed a procedural violation by not informing the defendants earlier; and if Donna Schuman did not tell the truth, the prosecutor was putting on a liar. Here was Hobson’s choice, the dilemma of having no choice at all, complicated by the fact that the most important witnesses to Schuman’s statement were those who had interviewed her; that is, Gary Kesselman and Lea D’Agostino. And like a true tale of the unexpected, the episode climaxed with the unprecedented phenomenon whereby both prosecutors ended up taking the stand as witness against each other! Their appearances were brief, with Kesselman’s limited at first, speaking as he did without benefit of his investigator’s notes. But it was enough for the defense to cry foul and demand a mistrial on the basis of impropriety in the handling of the case by the DA’s office. All of this took place within the first weeks of the trial. While in the end the matter remained unresolved, the event briefly proved a media bonanza. Most of the excitement remained veiled from the jury. But more important than either the facts and statements or the witnesses was the damage the jurors saw inflicted on the prosecution. At the very start of the trial, they received powerful impressions of a high-fashion prosecutor tripping over a mine field and a pretty blond witness who had kept a sensational disclosure secret for four years.

By putting on Donna Schuman first the prosecutor had sought to place an unredeemable light on the director’s behavior; instead, the jury got lost in peripheral issues as D’Agostino ended up calling witnesses to corroborate Donna Schuman. The irrational backfiring continued when a gossipy elderly chatterbox and occasional Hollywood writer named Kendis Rochlen took the stand ostensibly to help D’Agostino. In corroboration of her friend Donna Schuman, she told the court that Schuman had told her three years before about the “going to jail” banter by the two chief defendants. But as a witness Kendis Rochlen continued to chatter while being cross-examined by James Neal with results that were mortifying to the prosecution. Her admiration for Neal brought to the jury’s attention the fact that Landis’ chief defense counsel was a famous person, allowing Neal to seize one of the very few occasions the trial offered to impress the jury with his celebrity status. He was constantly interrupted by cries of praise from the admiring chatterbox. The entire opening episode with Donna Schuman consumed two weeks of the actual trial. It provided the Gothic mold from which poured the rest of the lengthy, sprawling proceeding. A pattern was contained in the backfiring of witnesses like Schuman and Kendis Rochlen, or in the bizarre twist where two prosecutors turned witness in their own case. The reintroduction of Gary Kesselman was the ghost of El Gaucho come back to haunt the DA’s office. Kesselman brought the excitable woman prosecutor to the edge of hysteria when six months later he returned to the stand to accuse both D’Agostino and Schuman of conspiracy to commit perjury! Meanwhile, the prosecutor established at this early stage the pattern of unorthodoxy to which she remained faithful till the end of the trial. To counter the tactics of Landis’ phalanx she conducted her own “disinformation campaign.” In one instance, she peppered her office with phony technical material bearing the names of non-existent experts. She simply made them up, like Col. Nagaer (Reagan spelled backwards) in the hope of catching Harland Braun in his well-worn rounds of the DA’s office late at night, thus spreading the erroneous impression that she would focus on his own pet delamination theory (and, in fact, one of the attorneys actually sent her a discovery request asking her to turn over all the information, including Col. Nagaer!) To the end of fomenting disarray in the Landis marriage", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634243667_cleaned.txt:288:54161e9e8e2f", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 1892, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634243667_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634243667", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634243667_cleaned", "chunk_index": 289, "text": "non-existent experts.

Nagaer!) To the end of fomenting disarray in the Landis marriage she considered subpoenaing Jacqueline Compton, an acting student at UCLA who, as Landis’ driver during the 1982 TZ production, had been rumored to have had a “relationship” with the director. Another tactic was a psychological shocker aimed at defeating Landis’ portrayal of the deaths on the set as merely an “industrial accident.” She erected in her office a gruesome picture board with photos from the coroner’s and sheriff ’s departments showing the dead children and Morrow’s decapitated head with his completely unidentifiable face. Occasionally she brought witnesses to look at it and until the end of the trial Harland Braun would get the best of the prosecutor by periodically inquiring in the hallway whether she still decorated her office with pictures of cutoff heads. At the same time, the defense lawyers worked on Neal’s “priority list” of witnesses. Neal had plenty of time to perfect the plan for it took the prosecutor six months to work through the more than 71 people she would call out of the 151 potential witnesses on her list. Assisted by his aide Jim Sanders, Neal met with the prime witnesses potentially key to “the plan” – stunt coordinator Gary McLarty, director of photography Steve Larner, script supervisor Kathryn Wooten and 1st AD, Elie Cohn. Paul Stewart’s attorney was responsible for bringing in the powdermen, especially the man on whom the whole plan hinged, Jimmy Camomile. To Braun fell a delamination expert by the name of Gary Fowler, as well as Folsey’s onetime gopher, Cynthia Nigh. Andy House, though on the priority witness list, refused to be interviewed by James Neal, but Leonard Levine, operating as a legal link between Nashville and LA, managed to set up what was to become an extremely critical meeting with him. To the chummy southerners Levine was “Lennybob,” whose own client, Dan Allingham, would never testify. Allingham sat quietly and rather forlorn through the entire ten months next to Folsey, who would not testily either. One of the witnesses in whom the prosecutor put great hopes was Jack Tice. But whether through bad luck or bad planning, the uncanny “backfiring” continued. The problem was the order of Tice’s appearance. He followed the five other fire marshals to the witness stand.

Among them they had worked on thousands of Hollywood movies over the past twenty years; and although they satisfied the prosecutor by stating in court that they had never observed the magnitude of special effects in conjunction with a low-flying helicopter as they had seen it done on the Landis set, their overall impression was of a group of ragtag retirees; a drab parade that went on for days, ending in unseemly finger-pointing capped by a bombshell that deepened D’Agostino’s credibility crisis with the 12 citizens in the box. Fire marshal Richard Ebentheuer jolted everyone as he testified for the first time in the case that he had given an early warning that the helicopter would crash and that his warning had been ignored by fire officers on the set. The defense again rose to cry foul. Implicitly, in front of the jury and explicitly in the hallway before the thronged media, Neal asked how John Landis could be held responsible for not knowing the scene was dangerous if the fire marshals didn’t think it was. Neal queried into the whirring tapes and blinking cameras, “Wasn’t it their job to prevent fire dangers on the set?” And when it was further revealed that Ebentheuer had issued a post-crash memo related to his early warning that had since disappeared from the files, Neal pulled thoughtfully on his Encanto cigar, “Now I know I really am in the ‘Twilight Zone.’” The whole episode reflected poorly on the prosecution. Even though the fire marshals were able to explain how they handled Ebentheuer’s warning, the doubt persisted that they sought to blame Landis for their own shortcomings. The defense did all it could to spread this feeling to the jury and it was largely due to this background of lingering suspicion that Jack Tice turned out not nearly as effective as the prosecution had hoped he would be. Since much of what had been done on the set that night appeared to have had the object of deceiving Tice, his testimony could have been devastating. He testified to the concealment of the children. He claimed that he was not shown mortars under any structures or huts. He asserted that the helicopter departed from its flight path in the final scene, moving far closer to the explosions than expected. He also mentioned that no one had ever asked him as persistently as the location manager Dick Vane did that night where he would be located for the fatal shot.

The defense prudently waived cross-examining him, the only time it did so for all of the 71 prosecution witnesses in the trial; as Jim Sanders put it, “You don’t fix something unless it’s broke.” The purpose of cross-examination is to discredit but this time they preferred to get the volatile witness off the stand rather than give him the opportunity to express anything that might be any more damaging. The trial’s most important group of witnesses were the people who had been closest to Landis on the set and had witnessed the final explosion and the crash: Kathryn Wooten, Elie Cohn, Andy House, Gary McLarty and Cynthia Nigh. Before appearing in court, they had met often with John Landis’ lawyers. In the process, some had been “softened,” others stiffened or bolstered, and one, at least, the second in command on the set that night, had been carefully groomed: by the time 1st AD Elie Cohn came face to face with the Dragon Lady he had met a number of times with the director’s private investigator Robert Frasco, as well as with Landis’ personal attorneys Joel Behr and John Diemer. On the eve of the trial, he conferred with James Neal and Neal’s aide, Jim Sanders. Though nominally witnesses for the prosecution, the testimony of this group tended to support Neal’s “plan.” For the prosecutor its members sounded a steady drumbeat of frustration. Her hopes of getting them to reiterate earlier accounts containing much that was damaging to the director went down in the “softened” versions they delivered on the stand. Their mild responses to the prosecutor’s questioning waxed even more tender of the director’s case under cross-examination by Neal. Their stories not only got changed and amplified but in buttressing “the plan” were decked out with fresh detail never heard before. Typical was Kathryn Wooten’s explanation of her own handwritten notations in the shooting script. Her original notes appeared to indicate that the exploding hut “spectacular” was scheduled for 2:20. Under oath she told the prosecutor that the reference applied to the explosions for the 9:30 take; by claiming that her actual 2:20 notation was a mistake, she helped defuse the characterization of a director driven to achieve “bigger” fireballs. Similarly, she backed off from the comment made four years before that the fatal fireballs were “three times” the size of those at 11:30; she explained that she had referred to them numerically and not by magnitude, bigger because “there were more of them.” In", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634243667_cleaned.txt:291:76c687cf6684", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 1895, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634243667_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634243667", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634243667_cleaned", "chunk_index": 292, "text": "prosecutor that the reference applied to the explosions for the 9:30 take; by claiming that her actual 2:20 notation was a mistake, she helped defuse the characterization of a director driven to achieve “bigger” fireballs.

When asked about the director’s last-minute warning to the spectators and crew to stand up for the final shot, Wooten testified that Landis customarily prefaced all action scenes with this summons. Unlike the occasion once before during the prelim, this time Landis’ one-time script girl did not mention danger as the reason. Throughout the proceedings Landis’ 1st AD had never failed to evince a willingness to change his recollections, notably those dealing with the cues to be used in the final shot. To Warner studio’s own in-house probe, as well as to private eye Frasco, he accounted himself as being “ninety-five per cent sure” that John Landis was the person who had screamed the fatal command. At the same time, he confided in the phalanx, giving them details which he never transmitted to the authorities or even to the studio. The trial heard him offer a new statement. This time he was “ninety-five per cent sure” that it was not John Landis but himself who issued the “lower, lower” order!!! Previously he had described to the phalanx the mysterious “stick” in the middle of the river as being an important cue for what he referred to as the “big one” – a particularly large village explosion in the final scene which he said was controlled from the firing board in the hands of Jerry Williams. At the trial Cohn never mentioned the “big one.” Cohn supported the director on key issues even when, like Wooten, it forced him into double talk. On the stand, under prosecution questioning he had been unable to specifically remember a single session either before the 11:30 or 2:20 takes; nonetheless, he gave a ringing affirmative when asked by Neal whether in his opinion it was a complete and well-rehearsed plan. Cohn confirmed “the plan” by stating that it was the helicopter’s mission to turn and go across the river and film the exploding village. Once more he revised the account he gave to Warner Bros., as well as his NTSB version from five years before when he never mentioned such a plan, instead stating that the helicopter was to “go back the same way we came…. turn and go back.” As far as the defense was concerned it mattered little that its own priority witnesses in sworn trial testimony contradicted statements they had", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634243667_cleaned.txt:292:0867aa7e0891", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 1896, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634243667_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634243667", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634243667_cleaned", "chunk_index": 293, "text": "turn and go across the river and film the exploding village.

It would matter very much, however, if on the stand they contradicted each other. And with no one was this concern more apparent than with the troubled “Alan Smithee” of the movie’s screen credits. Remorseful over his participation in a venture which he knew to be dangerous, Andy House could deal a mortal blow to a plan which sought to characterize the tragedy in Indian Dunes as “unforeseen and unforeseeable.” He might well contradict Elie Cohn who was on record as telling the jury that his 2nd AD had never raised safety matters with him, let alone approached him time and again with requests to use dummies. The intervening years had failed to erase the event from House’s mind. Despite the Alan Smithee substitution, he had been unable to sever himself from the deaths on the set. The pressure had mounted. During his terribly damaging testimony at the prelim Harland Braun had attacked him in the press. While House was working as a 2nd AD over at Walt Disney Studios in Burbank, John Landis had personally enlisted one of House’s superiors there, a senior VP of TV and motion picture production, to exert influence on him to meet with Landis or his lawyers. But even though House feared for his future prospects at the studio where Landis’ close friend Jeff Katzenberg held power, he continued to save his story for the witness stand, refusing to meet with James Neal. In his late thirties with three kids, including one new baby, he worried about the blacklist. Ultimately House was vulnerable to pressure. Nevertheless, he remained unwilling to get involved directly with the Landis defense – and if he did in the end it was because he felt certain sympathies with Dan Allingham. Both were little wheels within big wheels and there was probably tremendous pressure on Allingham as well, he felt. Andy The meeting took away much of House’s former militancy. As a result, the trial saw the “softened” form of House who gave a watered-down version of his almost constant danger warnings. Under the careful cross-examination of defense lawyer Levine, House testified that, although safety was a concern during the filming, his chief worry had been the “illegality” of the act of hiring the children. Gary McLarty was a taciturn stuntman with a rugged profile who kept his emotions bottled deep inside.

Under the careful cross-examination of defense lawyer Levine, House testified that, although safety was a concern during the filming, his chief worry had been the “illegality” of the act of hiring the children. Gary McLarty was a taciturn stuntman with a rugged profile who kept his emotions bottled deep inside. Around the time of the trial, he suddenly moved out of his home in the suburban San Fernando Valley to a remote part of the county. Up in Angeles Crest Forest, hidden in the brush and sage, he lived in a trailer invisible from the narrow mountain road, up which he would roar on his motorcycle to the empty spread he called his “ranch.” As the trial opened a mystery arose in the sheriff ’s department; in the DA’s special investigative division people asked where was Gary McLarty? The Dragon Lady breathed fire. She threatened to have him arrested if he didn’t respond to a subpoena. The elusive stuntman was finally served the summons before the trial as he was working on a movie set, but to investigators his mountain hideaway high up in Angeles Crest Forest remained unknown. The trial of John Landis came at an especially vulnerable point in Mc-Larty’s life. While being chased by subpoenas from the DA, he was in the midst of an acrimonious marital breakup. At age 50, after nearly 35 years of flipping over in cars and spilling from buildings in over 400 movies, McLarty was ready to make room in the business for younger people. Mc-Larty was Vic’s age, but unlike the actor who hoped to make a comeback, the stuntman dreamed of retirement and turning his ranch into a small location setting where movies could be shot. In reviewing his career, Gary McLarty liked to make a point of mentioning that when he first began stunting for Landis in Animal House his fee was just about that of the young director’s. Ever since, for over a decade, he had been Landis’ loyal stuntman with a working relationship that had always been intimate. The various action sequences in the Landis segment had involved the stunt coordinator from the earliest stage, when he accompanied John Landis to Morrow’s Sherman Oaks home, to the final night of shooting when he climbed aboard the helicopter with a combat-blackened face while Morrow in the blue suit of Bill got ready to make his dash with the children in the shallow river. McLarty had been the only one with direct knowledge of what Landis really wanted from Vic Morrow in the final shot. Understandably, he was not eager to get involved in a controversy in which, as far as he was concerned, he had only been following orders from the director.

McLarty had been the only one with direct knowledge of what Landis really wanted from Vic Morrow in the final shot. Understandably, he was not eager to get involved in a controversy in which, as far as he was concerned, he had only been following orders from the director. Keeping his mountain hideaway secret as the trial wound on, it was not until after McLarty testified that, following a tip from a reporter, Tom Budds was finally able to locate and interview the stuntman outside the courtroom – and experience the same “difficult” behavior that had angered Lea D’Agostino. McLarty was more forthcoming in his dealings with the phalanx. On the eve of the trial, he met with James Neal in Behr’s Century City offices. On another occasion he welcomed Eugene Trope to the “ranch.” Trope joined the stuntman in downing a bottle of whiskey, holding his own by pretending to keep up with his host while surreptitiously pouring out his tumblers. McLarty’s interest to the DA’s office was obvious from his prior testimony and the many questions it raised. Why was he up in the chopper during the final take and not on the ground with the director coordinating the stunt? Especially, why wasn’t he doubling for Vic and carrying two dummies instead of the 100-pound weight represented by two children that made the river-crossing so precarious? The account he gave in court failed to answer these questions. Some contradictions to this version could be found in the NTSB record, but the stuntman’s real story emerged only in private remarks confided to intimates. According to a number of these confidants, McLarty’s actual experiences on the set were far different from the way he described them under oath in the courtroom. But all that the prosecutor was able to learn concerning the doubtfulness of the stuntman’s courtroom story came during makeup-man Bob Westmoreland’s pre-trial interview with her. Westmoreland related having listened to McLarty complain during the shooting of the Nazi sequence that he was ready to be the stunt double in the scene with the helicopter and explosives, but that Landis wanted Vic to do it himself. Away from the trial setting, in fact, McLarty elaborated, “Landis definitely wanted Vic Morrow in his shot, he was the one he was shooting the movie about.” By the time Gary McLarty was called as a witness he was working as stunt coordinator on Beverly Hills Cop II. On the stand he denied the makeup artist’s recollections during several hours of grueling questioning by the prosecutor. The exchanges between the taciturn stuntman and the sharp gadfly marked the most unabashed hostility to be seen in the entire trial.

On the stand he denied the makeup artist’s recollections during several hours of grueling questioning by the prosecutor. The exchanges between the taciturn stuntman and the sharp gadfly marked the most unabashed hostility to be seen in the entire trial. McLarty with his emotions precariously bottled up inside looked menacing. He snarled at the prosecutor, who showed her emotions perhaps too plainly, for at times she could be seen visibly recoiling. Afterwards she dramatically recalled her fear that the witness would step down and sock her one. McLarty could later be seen seething in the hallway. Up in his trailer in Angeles Crest Forest he unburdened himself to Helen English, a close friend and neighbor. He discussed with Helen his fears of potential blacklisting as a result of his testifying a certain way and not in another. There was little encouragement for him as to his own predicament in his neighbor’s reminiscence of an incident that had involved her husband, a Hollywood cameraman over at RKO studios in the old days, who once witnessed an accident on a set. The moral of the story appeared to be that her husband had suffered as a result of telling the truth. But despite or because of his official reticence, McLarty seemed eager to let the truth be known. Perhaps in the belief that only stuntmen could understand his feelings, he chose for his confidants other members of his profession. One of these, an aspiring young stunt player who sought the veteran stuntman’s help in breaking into Hollywood, heard him grumble enigmatically, “Had they listened to me nobody would have been killed.” Only McLarty’s innermost circle was familiar with the allusion, for they heard him tell the true story of what took place between himself and the bearded director in the final moments before the fatal shot. What was remarkable about the story, and lent it credence, was that it supported the accounts given by others: from the greensman Jerry Cutten, Vic’s friend Billy Fine and Vic’s attorney Al Green to the set hairdresser Virginia Kearns, makeup-man Bob Westmoreland and the shooting schedule notation DBL/Bill, each supplied separate confirmation of the stuntman’s highly confidential account that the director pushed Vic into performances which the actor neither wished nor was equipped to do. In a recollection that contrasted sharply to his sworn testimony before the jury, McLarty gave this astonishing account at a party in the home of another well-known stunt coordinator: On that night in Indian Dunes just before the cameras rolled the rugged stuntman had in his arms two baby dummies wrapped in blankets.

Ready to step in for Vic with the dummies he asked Landis to let him go on and run across the river. McLarty related to his small circle of friends how in the last minutes he had tried to convince Landis that his run across the river with the dummies wouldn’t make any difference on the screen. Reportedly, he told the director there was no sense in getting Vic wet in the middle of the night. McLarty ended his story by saying that he got “talked out of it” by Landis who told him that the actor actually wanted to do the stunt himself… As it did for Andy House, the disaster never ceased being an ordeal for Gary McLarty. The complications of his life in the latter part of ’86, beset by a bitter marital breakup, the prospect of becoming a key witness in a criminal trial and his secret of the baby dummies, seemed to come to a head one day as he was returning home on his motorcycle from the shooting of Beverly Hills Cop II. Perhaps when he heard the police siren, he saw only further complications. In a real-life action scene that might have been an outtake from the cop movie he was just then working on he attempted to evade arrest, leading a high-speed police chase as he fled for the haven of sanity in the sage and brush of the clean, high Angeles forest. In a strange turn, a helicopter joined the pursuit, and it was as if the silent stuntman in his escape from the law was himself reenacting Vic’s chase by the Huey. The chase led up the narrow mountain road to the ranch where the helicopter roared and clattered as it stood over the trailer… as once the Huey had stood over the hut. The penalty for McLarty’s attempted evasion of arrest would certainly have complicated his life by putting him in jail. But it was Hollywood; and the complicated business was to have a happy ending. Just before his court appearance in his own case, discovering that the judge was an “an old movie buff,” McLarty invited the magistrate to the set of Beverly Hills Cop II where, as a special favor to the stuntman, the star, Eddie Murphy, allowed himself to be photographed with McLarty’s special guest, later signing the photos and presenting them to the judge.

The press, like the jury and the public, saw nothing of the battle for the souls of the key witnesses. The maneuvering of big law firms and big Hollywood studios, the restless movement of interests, the constant calculating of clever minds, the clandestine meetings and sub rosa signals were beyond the capacity of the press. The TZ press corps divided its time between the courtroom where decorum prevailed, more or less, and the hallway which, with its cameras, gossip and commotion, was like a movie set. Like any Hollywood trial, the personalities overshadowed the issues. The triad featured a famous Hollywood director and a leading man from Watergate. The press discovered in Lea D’Agostino a surprisingly feisty supporting role as the prosecutor who gave as good as she got. In the hallway the media people watched her hold her own with Harland Braun. She would come right up to the six-footer with all her little height and on tiptoe inform him that he was good-looking and reminded her of Spencer Tracy, while cautioning him to put his “mind in gear before it got going”; another time the press heard her tweak Braun’s countenance – if he was Pinocchio his nose would already be in Brooklyn. The hallway served the prosecutor as the arena to settle scores with the defense lawyers. In the middle of the corridor just outside the courtroom she dealt with those witnesses who on the stand backed off in favor of Landis. She accused them of out-and-out lying to protect their friend and employer. She blamed the blacklist for making witnesses hesitant to testify. During these hallway dramas the defense called her everything from being “star-struck” and wanting to be a movie star herself to being “strange-looking” and having the “brain of a radish.” Neal’s assistant Jim Sanders would ask, “How do you tell someone to have class?” But with her feisty repartee she stemmed in part the flow of Braun’s media quotes and with her confrontational stance she prevented the hallway from becoming completely a Joel Behr-John Landis production. She worked herself to exhaustion in order to satisfy her superiors in the DA’s office, who had bet on her that she could keep the trial from turning into a “DeLorean.” Landis’ restrained appearance demonstrated the success of Neal’s modification of his personal behavior, at least for the duration of the trial.

She worked herself to exhaustion in order to satisfy her superiors in the DA’s office, who had bet on her that she could keep the trial from turning into a “DeLorean.” Landis’ restrained appearance demonstrated the success of Neal’s modification of his personal behavior, at least for the duration of the trial. Judge Ben Landis had died the year before and it seemed as if James Neal replaced the father figure in the director’s life. Asserting parental supervision in the form of client control, perhaps only a man of Neal’s moral stature, prominence and authority, a “gray-haired eminence,” could keep John Landis in line. On numerous occasions during the trial when Judge Boren felt compelled to warn Landis or members of his party not to disturb the proceedings by making strange faces or communicating in esoteric signals, it was the calm paternal assurance of James Neal of Neal & Harwell which satisfied the judge that such incidents would not reoccur. Like much of the vital testimony, like “Bill” in the script, the Landis personality had been softened. For his daily courtroom wear Neal had changed his client’s glasses from hornrims to a softer wire frame. On occasion, when he arrived at the courthouse still wearing the dark black glasses that were his trademark, Landis’ costume designer wife could be seen shuffling through her purse and handing her husband the less striking wire spectacles that marked his ten-month courtroom appearance. Landis’ face was softened by removing much of the hair. On top the raven locks were shrunk down and the once rabbinically disordered beard was neatly trimmed. He looked gangling, like a Rick Baker creation in ill-fitting suits. In the hallway he was inseparable from his wife who tottered and towered over the small-statured flock of lawyers and even over her husband’s own six-foot frame. They held hands like a honeymoon couple and across the barrier in the courtroom continued to steal glances and pass messages. Mrs. Landis played down the look of a Hollywood wife. She appeared at the sessions looking like a middleclass homemaker in drab grays and browns, without jewelry, her hair long and free-flowing, without apparent benefit of a Hollywood stylist. The press quickly discovered, however, that the young Landises were not the stars of the trial but that the dominating personality was James Neal. Vintage southern in gesture and phrase, he intrigued and enthralled the media people. They clustered around him in the hallway and never grew tired of hearing his crackling observations for all of the ten months. At the beginning of the trial, in order not to create jealousy among the defense team, Neal kept himself aloof from the hallway forum, leaving to Braun the role of axe-man and ring master of the antics.

At the beginning of the trial, in order not to create jealousy among the defense team, Neal kept himself aloof from the hallway forum, leaving to Braun the role of axe-man and ring master of the antics. But as the trial dragged on (Neal said he tried Jimmy Hoffa twice and it never took this long) he could no longer pass up the opportunity to tell marvelous tales of Watergate and the times of Bobby Kennedy. He had been prosecutor in the Kennedy battle with the mob and related the chilling experience of seeing Jimmy Hoffa in court raise a hand at him, giving the unmistakable sign of “the finger.” To the younger cubs among his listeners the name Alexander Butterfield had little meaning but the older reporters in the hallway heard Neal add a footnote to the century’s biggest political scandal when he identified Butterfield, the former Air Force secretary in the Nixon cabinet, as the man he believed was Watergate’s mysterious “Deep Throat.” Neal came across to the jury as a good ol’ boy. During Elie Cohn’s testimony he reminded the jurors that he came from the Bible Belt. He brought a country note to LA law, a Nashville sound in which a ride to the courthouse in Trope’s Rolls was pronounced to be “high-cotton.” His approach to womanhood was respectful and gracious. “Oh, it’s not this pretty lady here, is it?” he cried out one day when Larry the Bailiff escorted Neal to meet his wife. “Ah always keep mah ize out for a pu- rettty woman.” His southern courtesy failed only with respect to the lady he insisted on calling “Mizz De Owgustino.” At the height of the flap caused by Donna Schuman’s appearance he quipped to Braun, referring to the salad days of Watergate, “Remember the days of the truth squad, Harland? Do you have a truth squad to follow Mizz De Owgustino?” On the prosecutor’s birthday Neal proposed to make a cake. “I wouldn’t make an ordinary cake,” he noted, “I’d make a cake in the form of a chocolate Oscar.” On another day the hallway was entertained by his suggestion that a psychiatrist who was asked to testify about Dorcey Wingo’s memory also analyze “Mizz De Owgustino.” There were other moments when the court adjourned with the lawyers packing their briefcases and the lagging spectator in the visitors’ gallery was treated to seeing the man from Watergate steal up impishly behind the bird-like prosecutor to swat in mock panic at the golden bee on her shoulder.

Occasionally in her presence he would whistle a few bars from Dixie, or mull out loud with Dan Allingham’s lawyer, announcing to the hallway at large the future of the prosecutor in politics: Tearing at the unity of the lawyers was the same social division of the set between the above-the-line-Neal, Braun and Levine-and the below-the-line, Eugene Trope and Arnie Klein, representing, respectively, Dorcey Wingo and Paul Stewart. The differences between the two sides had been bridged by the consensus over “the plan” which laid the entire accident to the misfiring by one man. Accordingly, Arnie Klein, though rank-wise lowest among Landis’ lawyers, for a brief time came to hold leverage over the defense team. It was up to Klein to deliver Jimmy Camomile since, for the plan to succeed, Camomile had to say for the first time that he fired early. For the sake of a plan whose viability rested on the testimony of the special effects crew, Neal continued courting Arnie Klein. As for Stewart, since he was a defendant, he had the right not to testify and like Folsey and Allingham he would follow Neal’s strategy by keeping off the stand the mass of contradictions which would become admissible if he testified. However, Neal was unable to prevent the prosecutor from subpoenaing under a grant of immunity the other powdermen, Jerry Williams, Jimmy Camomile, Harry Stewart and Kevin Quibell. Like Paul Stewart they had already in the past testified to many particulars that could undermine the “plan.” From Neal’s standpoint their appearance marked Klein’s moment of truth. It was his baptism of fire, the test whether he could deliver. The first powderman to take the stand was one of the youngest, Kevin Quibell, who at the time of the crash had been relatively new to SFX. For much of Quibell’s testimony Neal sat white-fisted behind his table as he watched a near-disaster unfold for his client. It could have been avoided, Neal felt, if Klein had handled it better. Quibell presented a picture of powdermen who did not pay much attention to the safety aspects of their trade. Quibell didn’t remember a 2 : 00A.M . “rehearsal” and stated that he had been firing squibs in the water from the shore opposite the village, stopping just before the helicopter crashed as he saw Vic Morrow stumble with the kids; he believed Vic was in trouble since the stumble had not been planned.

Neal was upset because until Quibell the stumble hadn’t been an issue, not even when the prosecutor had asked the 1st AD about it once before. Klein’s test was doubtful. Neal had reason to fear whether Klein would come through. More important than Quibell were the next two witnesses, Jerry Williams and Jimmy Camomile, both, according to their earlier testimony, responsible for the fireball explosions in the village and river that were in the helicopter’s flight path. Jerry Williams was questioned first, and this time Neal did not ball his hands so the blood drained from the knuckles. Bearded and burly, Jerry Williams showed hostility to the prosecutor second only to that of Gary McLarty, who would follow him to the stand a week later. Well-prepared by Klein on the Sunday before he took the stand, frequently glowering at the prosecutor, he told a story that was largely a repetition of past statements. But with the DA’s investigation already hopelessly bungled it hardly seemed to matter. The fact that during the crash Williams had been standing right next to John Landis and that he was the probable triggerman whose firing board connected to the fatal No. 4 mortar was not even an issue in the trial. Jerry Williams presented an extremely confusing account involving mortars, square and round, fireballs and the mechanics of black powder explosions. He was very clear, however, in a startling statement never heard before from him but which lent crucial support to “the plan.” Williams testified to attending a meeting with Stewart and Camomile just before the fatal shot where he said he was admonished by Stewart, “Whatever you do, don’t set off any explosions under the helicopter.” Asked by the prosecutor why in all of five years he had never throughout his various statements and interviews mentioned this meeting with the powder chief, Williams merely shrugged and said he had forgotten. The prosecutor, with a deep sense of his deliberate obfuscations, tried to make the most of the poor figure the burly witness cut in his testimony. But she was playing with a lot of loose ends and her goal of convincing the jurors eluded her. The rambling “hillbilly” scattered the threads or pulled at them with a brazen force so that they ravelled in her hands. To tie the knots she would have required answers to basic questions – answers which investigators or other parties never provided her. She had no clear idea as to who among the powdermen fired the fatal No. 4 “humdinger”", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634243667_cleaned.txt:302:f8b6a7385279", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 1906, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634243667_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634243667", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634243667_cleaned", "chunk_index": 303, "text": "testimony.

The rambling “hillbilly” scattered the threads or pulled at them with a brazen force so that they ravelled in her hands. To tie the knots she would have required answers to basic questions – answers which investigators or other parties never provided her. She had no clear idea as to who among the powdermen fired the fatal No. 4 “humdinger” or how explosives got spirited from the set; the picture of powdermen boozing on the set was never laid before the jurors; other support in the form of cooperation from Warner studios which had all the evidence of a “shoddy” operation was equally lacking. These vast lacunae in an already bewildering picture had the effect on the jurors of making the issues presented by Jerry Williams even more intricate and confusing. Deprived of a pattern capable of delineating the role of each powderman, the prosecutor could only use Williams to cast doubt on the SFX crew’s credibility as a whole. Among other things, she demonstrated that Williams himself, contrary to his testimony, was not watching the helicopter during the final flight. By furnishing as proof the sound studies done by the sheriff ’s department, she showed that Williams was still firing his explosions long after the helicopter had been hit. This strongly suggested he was not looking. Even if Williams had been told by his chief to look up and not set off any explosions under the craft, which he’d never mentioned before, the sound studies indicated that he violated Stewart’s instruction by not looking up. The strangest story of a witness was that of Jimmy Camomile, the “pigeon” singled out by Neal because some of his previous statements were completely out of sync with “the plan.” Unlike the confused and ambiguous expressions from the other powdermen on record, Camomile in his very early interviews with investigators had made explicit denials of having been told anything about the flight path or where the chopper would be, or of any discussions in which he was instructed not to fire any bombs until the helicopter left the area. Of all the powdermen, Camomile was alone insofar as his prior statements and testimony ran absolutely contrary to the defense version Neal wished to present to the jury. Camomile’s eventual adherence to the “plan” came about largely as the result of forceful promptings from his friends. At the time of the prelim Paul Stewart and Jerry Williams had succeeded in convincing him that he was the “triggerman,” despite the fact that almost all the original evidence showed that it was Jerry Williams who, from his firing board, blew up hut No. 4.

But for the trial Paul Stewart asked Camomile to take one further step and corroborate Jerry Williams’ novel testimony. Camomile was asked to say that just before the last shot Stewart had conveyed to them a “safe plan” not to fire any bombs under or near the helicopter. Camomile agreed in principle to corroborate Stewart’s last-minute instructions: Arnie Klein, however, was not satisfied until he took the unusual step to obtain a signed statement to that effect just before Camomile took the stand. Klein was the only defense lawyer able to develop a rapport with the powdermen, who were still Paul Stewart’s close friends. Through a discreet network Klein was able to keep in touch with the SFX crew without directly involving his client. Just how loyal they remained to Stewart became evident when Frasco, Landis’ detective, informed Neal that Jerry Williams would not meet with the Nashville attorney without Arnie Klein being present. Klein’s counsel had helped the SFX crew deal with seeming inconsistencies by subtly shading their testimony. But the task of bringing round Camomile was an operation delicately borderline to soliciting perjury. At a crucial meeting in Klein’s Century City office on the eve of Camomile’s appearance before the prosecutor, Camomile listened as Klein explained that, if convicted, Paul Stewart might end up in San Quentin. Camomile came to realize how important it was for him to testify that just before the fatal shot Paul Stewart had instructed him not to fire any SFX explosives under or near the helicopter. By the time Camomile took the stand just before Christmas of 1986, the jury had heard his name mentioned many times as the triggerman who allegedly fired the fatal explosion. In the hallway the press, at least the male portion, had heard Neal refer on many occasions to what he termed facetiously Camomile’s “premature ejaculation.” Klein all the while feared that his story about Stewart being sent to state prison might inadvertently slip from the tongue of the witness, and with the prosecutor asking, “Is that why you’re changing your testimony?” send the plan, and perhaps his law career, crashing to the ground. But Camomile’s trial appearance turned out to be Klein’s finest hour. Just before the crucial session commenced, Klein basked in the attention of the Landis legal squad, was nervous and excited. “Get ready for the Arie Klein show,” he announced with bravura just before he entered the courtroom; and afterwards in the hallway during the break it was like being a star during the intermission of", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634243667_cleaned.txt:304:ec6d0fba7131", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 1908, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634243667_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634243667", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634243667_cleaned", "chunk_index": 305, "text": "your testimony?” send the plan, and perhaps his law career, crashing to the ground.

On the stand Camomile had stuck to the new version supporting the “safe plan” which proved the tragedy at Indian Dunes to have been an unforeseeable accident. The youthful-looking ex-Navy man with his frank gaze and refreshing sobriety kept his promise. He testified that he had been warned by Paul Stewart just before the crash not to fire off his mortar near or underneath the helicopter. He stated that Stewart told him to look up before firing… Outside the presence of the jury, D’Agostino persistently raisedthe issue of blacklisting and tried to have the judge admit as ev-idence examples of industry pressure on witnesses. In most instances the judge either banned such testimony or in a few cases limited it to very narrow areas. In the hallway James Neal argued before the press that the prosecutor had no basis for her allegations. The national hero of Watergate blunted the critiques even of witnesses who at the trial confessed to fear, or who had actual experience of being deprived of jobs in Hollywood for political reasons. Nevertheless, despite these hindrances, the prosecutor did manage to get before the jury some highly effective witnesses drawn from the industry itself. Years after the Twilight Zone crash, news spread that cameramen Steve Lydecker and Roger Smith still had difficulty getting work. But in other cases, like Andy House at Disney, subtler examples of work-place pressure on witnesses never reached the press. Alpha Campbell complained that a particular secretary had been planted next to her in the office at Universal studios to keep an eye on her at the time of the trial. And Marci Liroff, the casting agent who once cast for E.T. and Poltergeist, felt that she had suffered professionally as the result of having testified that she warned Landis about the danger of using the kids in the scene. Due to certain rulings by the judge, the prosecution had to focus its case exclusively on the fatal scene. To show criminal negligence it had to prove to the jury what the Hollywood customs and practices were in the shooting of similar action scenes involving dangerous special effects. A fine line separated simple negligence due to error or oversight from a reckless act in which the dangers are explicitly known.

At the same time hardly any California law dealt with standards regulating Hollywood’s use of explosives and aircraft as they related to special effects. To help show the wanton recklessness and implied malice of the act with which Landis was criminally charged, Hollywood’s foremost motion picture helicopter pilot, James Gavin, made an impressive appearance. Ironically, Landis had three years before attempted to recruit Gavin for Blues Brothers, but the famous stunt pilot had been busy at the time. Ramrod straight, salt-and-pepper Hollywood handsome, Gavin had performed as a precision pilot in over 500 motion pictures in his 27 years in the industry, from John Huston’s 1959 The Misfits to his recent Blue Thunder. Besides being a stunt pilot and stunt coordinator, he was also a 2nd unit director and member of the Director’s Guild and well-known for his activism in the DGA to upgrade the professional standards for air stunts. He had been trained in the military. Moreover, he had not only flown through many explosions and fireballs but also had extensive experience flying in scenes with SFX explosions shot at Indian Dunes. Gavin had been involved, along with another famed Hollywood pilot, Ross Reynolds, as adviser to NTSB investigators immediately following the 1982 Twilight Zone crash. He had even been the recipient of a leaden letter from Harland Braun at the time of the crash because he openly criticized Landis in a People magazine article. His declaration that he would not have piloted the helicopter under the conditions that existed that night contained a stinging rebuke of both Landis and Wingo. Well up on the case, having actually read key documents, Gavin described the whole operation that night in the dunes as a catastrophe. His most damaging criticism was leveled at the pilot for not having followed the customs and standards of the profession. At 11:30, after near disaster in the rage scene, Gavin maintained, Wingo should have removed himself and his helicopter from the set. After being surprised by the location of the uncommonly powerful fire and water mortar that buffeted his craft, he should have realized that the director had either failed to inform him or had altered the plan without telling him – sufficient reason either way to refuse further participation in the filming of the scene. A different problem for D’Agostino was finding a peer of John Landis in the industry itself.

A different problem for D’Agostino was finding a peer of John Landis in the industry itself. She wanted a professional film maker to explain to the jurors in simple terms film as the art of illusion, making it clear how John Landis could have achieved his cinematic effects without exposing cast and crew to danger. But no director came forward. Stumped in her search, for D’Agostino, despite her rumored liaison with Peter Sellers, was not at all well-connected in Hollywood, she was forced to concentrate on directors whose comments in response to the crash had been quoted in the press. The DGA had gone on record with the promise to take some action once the trial was over, and a review of the 1982 state senate hearings enabled the prosecutor to identify certain key people involved in guild safety issues, notably, Harry Evans, DGA executive vice president, and directors Jackie Cooper and Richard Brooks. Accompanied by her DA investigator, Jerry Loeb, the prosecutor held the first exploratory meeting with Jackie Cooper and Harry Evans at DGA headquarters on June 14, 1986, a month before the start of the trial. Harry Evans had known Vic Morrow personally. Jackie Cooper at 64, whose film career beginning at age three almost spanned the entire history of Hollywood, regaled the prosecutor with stories of the film capital’s fascinating past. On a more serious note, however, he felt uncomfortable about committing himself to an appearance as a prosecution witness since the DGA itself still adhered to a non-aligned stand until the trial’s conclusion. As head of the DGA safety committee, Jackie Cooper declared himself firmly behind statements he made at the senate hearings in October 1982. He voiced the same strong belief that the director’s role included “an obligation for the safety of those on the set,” mentioning proudly the guild’s new safety standards prepared as a result of the crash. The prosecutor, in turn, urged him to see the fatal Twilight Zone footage. At last, she pulled out of an envelope a series of photographs of the decapitated heads of Vic Morrow and Myca, as well as a photo of the shoulder and arm separated from the boy. Loeb could see that Cooper was shaken by the presentation. Ten days after the meeting with Jackie Cooper, D’Agostino met with Richard Brooks. The noted guild director, who 30 years earlier had actually brought Vic Morrow to Hollywood from New York to do Blackboard Jungle, recounted to D’Agostino the famous fire scene in Elmer Gantry. He readily acknowledged that the director and the stunt coordinator had to be prepared for every eventuality when doing a", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634243667_cleaned.txt:307:42e9641c3de0", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 1911, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634243667_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634243667", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634243667_cleaned", "chunk_index": 308, "text": "arm separated from the boy.

He readily acknowledged that the director and the stunt coordinator had to be prepared for every eventuality when doing a hazardous scene. In Brooks, too, the prosecutor felt a willingness to depart from the guild’s neutral position on the Twilight Zone tragedy. Both directors were in their sixties and two days after the meeting with Brooks she met with John Milius, a director from the brash young world of John Landis. Jerry Loeb had arranged the meeting by using one of his studio contacts. Milius was identified with the youthful mainstream, Coppola and the University of Southern California film school group. He’d written the screenplay for Apocalypse Now and belonged with Hollywood’s money-making movie makers that filled screens with action movies like his own Conan the Barbarian and Red Dawn. The prosecutor knew that she had left behind the mellow generation of Jackie Cooper and Richard Brooks and entered the strange world of the new young Hollywood in Milius’ office on the 20th Century Fox lot. Facing down from one wall was a giant portrait of Marine Corps General “Chesty” Bowles. The director was surrounded by swords and rifles functioning as decorations. His girlfriend was there, a Hollywood starlet, and together the director, the Dragon Lady, the starlet and the investigator went to lunch. The prosecutor again carried her grim bundle of photos. She displayed them during lunch. The pictures succeeded in riveting Milius’ attention. He agreed with much of what she said about her belief that Landis had caused a needless accident by being disorganized and reckless on the set. He even made specific mention of his disagreement with Landis about putting the kids beneath the helicopter. But in the end, he showed weakness as a potential prosecution witness since he didn’t believe, as a director, that someone could be held responsible for something that was what he called unforeseeable. Unable to find a witness for her case from among Landis’ own generation of directors, the prosecutor concentrated on Jackie Cooper. One week before the trial officially opened, she returned to the DGA screening room with Loeb and Budds for a showing to Cooper and Brooks of the scenes depicting the crash. Both men were appalled. Brooks in astonishment shouted out during the showing, “These kids are next to gas and explosives! He shouldn’t be doing that!” As he watched the scene unfold with the kids waiting in the hut, he shook his head. “It was unbelievably stupid.” Loeb heard Brooks curse when the screen erupted with explosions next", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634243667_cleaned.txt:308:d16b8a809f1b", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 1912, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634243667_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634243667", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634243667_cleaned", "chunk_index": 309, "text": "returned to the DGA screening room with Loeb and Budds for a showing to Cooper and Brooks of the scenes depicting the crash.

Afterwards, Jackie Cooper expressed being “very disappointed in Landis’ techniques.” The scene should have been shot with a long-range camera. The kids never should have been placed near the explosives in the first place due to the possibility of an accidental detonation. Jackie Cooper was one of the last witnesses for the prosecution and his appearance on February 9 and 10, 1987, created a considerable stir. After six months of trial proceedings the prosecutor finally had a real star to help her case. Entering film acting at age 3, Cooper was the first child actor ever to receive an Oscar nomination, at age 9. After that a steady series of appearances on screen and TV made Cooper’s cherubic face a recognizable icon to a generation of viewers with more in common with John Landis’ mother than her demographically distant son. Even Judge Boren’s wife came to see the famous witness. Harvard’s legal pundit Alan Dershowitz showed up, as well as director Dan Petrie. Petrie had done a cameo in Landis’ Into the Night. A member of the DGA executive committee like Jackie Cooper, Petrie was deeply opposed to Cooper’s cooperation with the prosecutor. Jackie Cooper was something of an institution in Hollywood. On the stand he proudly mentioned his honorary Navy flying wings. In his testimony he described the film the jurors had also seen, and going through the takes, 9:30, 11:30 and 2:20, he opined that each of these scenes posed danger to either Vic or the children. As a director he could easily spot the lack of safety precautions by just looking at the film. Even at 9:30, he said, the kids were sitting right next to the explosives in the hut and he could see them again at 2:20 placed near live explosives before the crash occurred. Like the Hollywood stunt pilot before him, he believed that after the near miss at 11:30 the set should have been shut down and everybody sent home. Jackie Cooper’s courage in breaking with the ranks of Hollywood directors provided a high point in the trial but for him personally the aftermath was a letdown. The virulent reactions to his testimony surprised him. Death threats were actually phoned to the unlisted number at his home in Beverly Hills. At the same time the DGA’s official leadership rebuffed him.

At the same time the DGA’s official leadership rebuffed him. Following one DGA meeting, director Dan Petrie was seen confronting Cooper, “How could you rat on a fellow director?” DGA president Gil Cates went so far as to depart from the guild’s five-year policy of silence. He issued a statement in the Hollywood trade papers, without approval from the guild body or counsel, that Cooper, the chairman of the DGA safety committee, did not speak for the guild in his appearance at the trial. To Cooper personally, Cates lamely explained that he had received a lot of phone calls and had gone public in the belief that it would be best for the guild. Jackie Cooper realized the DGA didn’t want to make waves. In his disappointment he prepared to resign from the safety committee. He didn’t understand it. As D’Agostino came to the end of her witness list and the trial entered its sixth month, the position of Dorcey Wingo vis-a-vis his co-defendants still remained that of outsider. The fact that at this late hour the pilot still had lawsuits against his co-defendants indicated just how anomalous his position was. In fact, both the prosecution and defense recognized Wingo as the pivotal defendant whose testimony ultimately might help either side. He was still up for grabs. The lawyers for Landis and Wingo were never more distrustful of each other. The two men were of contrasting styles. The goateed Trope, a figure from a Victorian picture book, wore suits of an unfashionable cut and bold in color. Neal always wore subdued Wall Street suits. Trope, at 69 the oldest member of the defense team, sensed from Landis a lack of deference and felt that Neal snubbed him. He felt ignored and hurt and unwelcome in the circle that had Neal at the center. Despite Wingo’s readiness to fall in with “the plan,” Neal had never revealed to Trope the latest Landis’ defense strategy. Both Neal and Trope feared being outwitted or surprised by the other. The trial on several occasions saw their conflict spill from the courtroom into the hallway. Better versed in business than criminal law, Trope’s legal tactics at times baffled everyone. His gaffes quickly earned the sobriquet “malatropisms” and his blunders injected into the proceedings an unexpected dose of humor. He and Neal collided strikingly on the different approaches to handling certain key witnesses. Neal’s Olympian demeanor often sustained severe jolts from his portly colleague.

He and Neal collided strikingly on the different approaches to handling certain key witnesses. Neal’s Olympian demeanor often sustained severe jolts from his portly colleague. One such occasion presented itself when on the witness stand fireman/studio teacher Jack Tice displayed such hostility to Landis that, rather than cross-examining him, the defense lawyers wanted him to vamoose as quickly as possible – all except Trope, whom Neal only in the last minute succeeded in turning the angry witness away from further questioning and creating a possible catastrophe. A far more serious clash between the two lawyers occurred in connection with the testimony of Jimmy Camomile. Neal practically begged Trope not to question the key SFX man about his involvement in a separate helicopter accident during the filming of Blue Thunder. Bringing to the jury’s attention another incident with a chopper, Neal feared, would damage the defense argument of “unforeseeability.” According to the dossier that the phalanx kept on Jim Hensler, the safety conditions under Paul Stewart’s control on Blue Thunder were appalling. But Trope’s mind was made up: he was going to ask Camomile about Blue Thunder. In the hallway Neal practically went down on his knees. “I beg you, Gene. Please, I beg you…” Neal continued imploring in the courtroom. In full view of the spectators, he reached behind John Landis’ chair and tugged beseechingly at Trope’s jacket. When Trope passed up questioning Camomile, Neal could be seen breathing with visible relief. All in all, however, Trope was less leery of Neal than he was of John Landis, and of neither man more so than he was of Joel Behr with whom he had warred for four years. Just before Landis was scheduled to take the stand in mid-February, Trope became alarmed when a sudden thaw entered the relations between the movie director and his client. He suspected Behr had something brewing. Normally Trope and Wingo ate lunch separately in the courthouse cafeteria and were never invited over to the table of the Landis crowd. But suddenly John Landis and Wingo together began walking up to the 15th floor courtroom after lunch break rather than take the elevator. Ostensibly, both liked the exercise. About the same time John and Deborah Landis accompanied Wingo and his wife to the drag races. The warmth between them grew. Mrs. Landis shared baby photos and exchanged spicy recipes with Mrs. Wingo, who was born in Mexico. Trope became more and more irritated.

Suspecting that Landis tried to influence his client he called out to Wingo one day, “Hey, Dorcey, you keep listening to John Landis, and you’ll be wearing those striped pajamas!” In the hallway Trope on occasion would return from visiting the men’s room or making a phone call and find Wingo conversing with Neal. Trope learned later from Wingo that Neal had been trying to get the pilot to change his version of the facts. These latest indignities, coupled to his personal dislike of Landis and Behr, had the combined effect of making Trope no longer reluctant to consider a deal from the prosecution. Approaching Trope with such an offer was Lea D’Agostino’s idea. From her early dealings with Trope, she had continued to perceive Wingo as the weak link in the defense. She knew that Trope felt that Landis had been reckless and that Wingo basically got dragged into sharing the charges with his co-defendants. To district attorney Ira Reiner she explained the opportunity Wingo offered to fragment the defense. They could show there was no plan. Reiner fell in enthusiastically. But because of her alienation from Trope following the secret meeting in Judge Boren’s chamber, she was thought not to be the best person to initiate the delicate contact. At this late point in the trial Reiner was eager to make good the series of snafus that had made him grow impatient with a case where Kesselman, Donna Schuman and Ebentheuer were names for disasters which he associated with D’Agostino’s conduct of the proceedings. The deal with Dorcey Wingo also looked good to Reiner’s high command, provided they could first hear the pilot’s story. DA investigator Loeb was charged with secretly establishing contact with Trope in order to feel him out. Loeb made the contact and set the condition. “You’d have to initiate the deal,” he told Trope. “It could not come from us.” Trope was surprisingly receptive to the idea of lining up with the prosecution against John Landis. In a meeting between Trope and Reiner in the DA’s office, Reiner officially blessed the deal and guaranteed that if Wingo’s cooperation proved acceptable the DA would offer dismissal of the charges against him. The key meeting of the DA’s men with Wingo took place in the office of the Trope law firm on February 4, exactly two weeks before Landis would surprise the courtroom and take the stand. Reiner and his top advisers had agreed that Lea D’Agostino should not attend the session because Trope was too “intimidated” by her.

Reiner and his top advisers had agreed that Lea D’Agostino should not attend the session because Trope was too “intimidated” by her. That left the highly sensitive debriefing of the pilot to investigators Budds and Loeb, neither of whom had the prosecutor’s breadth of understanding of the case. In addition to the investigators, the session was attended by two attorneys, Dick Hecht, of the triumvirate with Reiner and Garcetti, and the DA’s chief expert on appellate matters, Harry Sonnheim. In a three-hour recorded interview Wingo gave a much more personal impression of his two nights at Indian Dunes. He described for the first time his own observations of the director’s erratic actions; charming one moment, abusive, foul-mouthed and tyrannical the next. Although Wingo said that he had never heard Landis refer to him abusively, he mentioned numerous instances when he had heard the director yell, “fuck you,” and other four-letter words. He recalled Landis’ outburst at the best boy, “chickenshit,” for refusing to climb a tottering scaffolding on the set. He remarked on Landis at times behaving “just like somebody who asked for a pie in the face.” He spoke in terms that frequently contradicted the idea of a plan, especially in a key phrase where he stated that he had been “blown out of the sky.” Unexpectedly, like so many of the contretemps in which the case abounded, the meeting was marked by a potentially spectacular encounter in the hallway of Trope’s Westside legal suite. Taking Hecht aside during a break in Wingo’s interview, Trope told the highest ranking DA lawyer in attendance that, during the trial, the former Watergate prosecutor had made attempts to get Wingo to change his story – in Hecht’s words, “to suborn perjury.” Trope advised Hecht that when the interview resumed, he should ask Wingo about it on the record. Hecht returned to the room and, before the pilot had the chance to confer with his lawyer, Hecht questioned him and heard Wingo confirm under oath that one of the defense lawyers had attempted to persuade him to alter his version of the facts. Astonished by the allegations made by another officer of the court, and corroborated by a defendant in the case, that James Neal would try to suborn perjury, Hecht was nonplussed by the way in which it had supposedly been done. He wondered if Trope’s shocking revelation might be a trick by the defense to cause a mistrial. He faced the unsettling element of surprise which others in the case had experienced before him.

Confounded, Hecht explained to himself that he was not there for the purpose of opening up perjury charges; he quietly let the matter rest. Loeb and Hecht, both excited about the transcript from their three hours with Wingo in Trope’s office, the next day played a 30- minute portion of the tape for Ira Reiner. The DA was pleased. He particularly liked the key sections where Wingo talked about how he was blasted out of the sky, with which the DA hoped to show that Landis had no safety plan. With the single reservation that Wingo needed more work, Hecht joined Loeb in communicating the sense of a breakthrough in the case. They all agreed it was a “go,” and Reiner proposed a press conference with himself in attendance. There was tremendous excitement, even talk of further debriefing the pilot and using the nearby New Otani Hotel as a safe house to keep Wingo out of Landis’ clutches. The trouble began, however, when Loeb and Budds brought the tapes of Wingo’s interrogation to be played for the prosecutor in her office. She went into a fury and threw a temper tantrum of the sort familiar to her inner circle, to which both Loeb and Budds unhappily at that moment, belonged. When informed of Reiner’s plan for a press conference the prosecutor raged that her boss had evaluated the issue without her even seeing the transcript. She resented Reiner for taking all the credit. Earlier, when it first appeared that the recruitment of Wingo might succeed, there had already been ego battles between the prosecutor and the DA about who was going to preside over the headline-making press conference to announce the deal. In the end the prosecutor rejected Wingo’s story. Despite its far more critical view of Landis, and for all the raw personal detail, she felt dissatisfied that he still hedged and held to the position that there were meetings, that there was planning, and that the director was not entirely responsible for the crash. Apart from John Landis’ role in the fatal scene, the question for Hol-lywood was not whether the director was guilty but why Landis obvious question was whether Steven Spielberg, through Frank Marshall and Kathleen Kennedy, had known that children were being employed illegally on the set, and if so, why wasn’t he or someone from his organization on trial?

Why weren’t Spielberg, Marshall and Marshall’s girl-friend, Kathleen Kennedy, ever questioned? And what did the big studio know of the illegal hiring? His absence was perfectly consistent with the gentleman’s agreement that had been hammered out three years earlier among all the defense lawyers. At one of the most important strategy meetings in the offices of O’Melveny & Myers the gentlemen had, in effect, pledged to prevent their adversaries from becoming aware of the differences that existed among them. According to the people at Spielberg’s Amblin Entertainment at Universal City, Marshall’s absence was due to his work on two new Spielberg productions, Empire of the Sun and Roger Zemeckis’ Who Framed Roger Rabbit? Spielberg’s closest associate was kept away from the entire judicial proceedings, sparing the trial what would have certainly become a sensational face-off. For there could be little doubt that, if called to testify, Marshall would give damaging testimony against Landis. An open confrontation between the two men would have also drawn Warner Bros., unavoidably, into a public exposure in the criminal case – clearly not in the interest of either. Even should Marshall comply with Landis’ earlier request and admit at the trial that he, and by implication Spielberg, knew about the illegal hiring of Myca and Renee, it would not necessarily guarantee that the jury would go any lighter on the director and the other defendants. At best it might encourage sympathy for the director as being the lone fall guy. On the other hand, the prosecutor could always argue that the act of just knowing about the illegal hiring was far different from actually exposing the children to hazardous conditions. She could argue that Spielberg and Marshall had little to do with the actual event relating to the deaths on the set. At the same time, an open denial by Marshall that he, the studio, or anyone else associated with the Spielberg side of the production knew about the illegal scheme to employ the children would pit Spielberg squarely against Landis, both of whom along with Warner Bros., were still co-defendants in the multi-million-dollar civil suits of the Le and Chen families. Aside from Spielberg and Marshall, only the executives at Warner realized the havoc a confrontation between the two movie partners would bring in its wake.

Marshall and his lawyers had made it clear to Warner executives that Spielberg’s man knew nothing about the illegal hiring. At the same time Warner had been warned by the phalanx at the “showdown” meeting four years before that the young director, if pushed, was prepared to point the finger at Frank Marshall, Kathleen Kennedy, Warner’s Lucy Fisher and Spielberg himself. It would have been easy for Landis’ lawyers to show that throughout the affair Marshall acted like someone who had something to hide. Had it surfaced through a court confrontation, the image of Spielberg’s close associate carrying the crushed body of little Renee Chen from the river to her wailing mother and then dashing from the scene before the police arrived would have made a very poor impression on both the jury and the public. Apart from confiding in his lawyers and Steven Spielberg, the only account Marshall gave of his role in the seamy affair was to Warner’s own high-level investigators shortly after the Indian Dunes disaster. Through close consultations with Marshall’s own lawyer, Tom Pollock, the men from Warner heard his assertion that at the time of the fatal shot he had been standing with Dick Vane across the river, watching the scene in the belief that Vic was carrying dummies. Vane was the only person on the set who supported Marshall’s version of the story, even though the location manager had admitted that he knew the kids were still on the set illegally at 2 : 20A.M . Just how destructive an open confrontation between Marshall and Landis would be was revealed in a highly confidential Warner memo in which Spielberg’s man maintained that he had been deceived by the Landis people. Marshall claimed that he was told nothing by Folsey about the use of the kids in the fatal scene. About the $2, 000 check used to get the cash to pay the kids with his signature on it, Marshall confided to Warner that Folsey had told him it was a “salary advance.’’ According to Marshall’s version, when his own accountant, Bonnie Radford, brought him the check, neither he nor Radford knew its actual purpose. Indeed, Marshall depicted an M.O. involving deception as having been rampant on the Landis segment. Marshall’s accountant had reported having already once before blocked an attempt by Allingham to pay electricians “under the table.” Characterizing the Landis operation as “shoddy,” Marshall insisted to Warner that he had let Allingham know his concern about making the right arrangements for the kids and getting the right permits.

But while impugning Landis in his highly colored account to the studio investigators, the attempt to extricate himself knotted Marshall into numerous inconsistencies. Even as he admitted to having discussed the children’s scenes, he maintained that neither Landis, Folsey, nor Allingham ever told him anything about the illegal hiring plan. At the one meeting where the subject of the two explosion scenes involving the kids came up, Marshall said he had warned Allingham that Landis’ idea of using fourand five-year-olds at night would pose a problem if the scenes were to be shot after 6 : 30 P.M . He suggested, in the version he gave Warner, that for one of the village shots Folsey and Allingham consider using young-looking 12-year-olds as he and Spielberg had done in E.T., explaining that with 12-year-olds waivers could be obtained until 12:00 or 12:30 a.m. – an assertion the implication of which could not have failed to be noted by the sharp studio lawyers. It simply meant that Landis’ motive for breaking the law had not been the late hour! A waiver could have been obtained, as Marshall pointed out. The inference was inescapable that Landis had not chosen to obtain a waiver because it would have included a studio teacher to see to the safety of the kids in a shot whose super-realism demanded that they be placed near explosives!!! When the meeting’s agenda turned to the final exploding village scene, Marshall claimed Allingham had assured him that there wouldn’t be any problem with real kids because it would be a “long shot” – doubles or dolls would be used with cameras back far enough from the set so the difference wouldn’t be apparent on screen. Having contended with a similar problem in a scene in Poltergeist in which a woman appears to be running with her child, while in actuality, a lighter and less cumbersome doll, Marshall said his experience with the doll made Allingham’s explanation sound reasonable. The studio heard Marshall indicate that until the night of the crash the issue of the kids never came up again. As he had done on most of the 12 days of Landis’ night shooting schedule, Marshall came for the wrap and this time brought his girlfriend and business partner Kathleen Kennedy with him. Together they watched the filming of the 9:30 scene in which they saw the kids with the explosions going off behind them.", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634243667_cleaned.txt:317:fc7f891a5c79", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 1921, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634243667_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634243667", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634243667_cleaned", "chunk_index": 318, "text": "Allingham’s explanation sound reasonable.

Together they watched the filming of the 9:30 scene in which they saw the kids with the explosions going off behind them. It was his belief at the time, so Marshall stated to his listeners from the studio echelons, that Allingham and Folsey had taken up his suggestion of using 12-yearolds with waivers to film past 6:30 since in his eyes the kids looked “big.” With Kathleen Kennedy he next watched the 11:30 rage scene; his listeners were informed that he didn’t think it was dangerous. After they had dinner together with Dick Vane around midnight, Marshall’s girl-friend went home, leaving Marshall and Vane to watch the final shot. When the final action began, Marshall told the Warner brass that he was standing next to Vane and was dumbfounded to see live children in Morrow’s arms as the actor crossed the river. Marshall said he expressed disbelief to Vane who replied that he, too, thought that dolls were to be used. Marshall noted that even the film’s paperwork and documents backed him up in showing that he could not have known about the use of real children in the final scene. He maintained that the notations in Landis’ actual shooting schedule were consistent with Allingham’s explanation that dolls or dummies would be used in that scene. Specifically, the notation in the shooting schedule “DBL/Bill,” indicating that a double would be used for Vic, conveyed to him the assurance that cameras would be shooting from a distance. The story in which Spielberg’s man pointed the finger directly at Landis remained known only to a select group of powerful executives at Universal and Warner. Marshall’s attorney, Rick Rosen, confidentially let it be known that he and his client believed that Landis had created an “incredibly dangerous situation putting the kids below the chopper with bombs going.” To only a select few Rosen circulated the story that Marshall never knew about the kids and had he known he never would have let it happen. Marshall’s account never received a public airing in a court of law or otherwise and so the fundamental differences between Spielberg and Landis did not turn into a messy credibility contest before the public or the jury. But in the hallway of the Criminal Court building the feeling among many of the defendants was that they had been abandoned by Spielberg and Marshall. Their anger was expressed in accusations of betrayal, dishonesty and weakness.

But in the hallway of the Criminal Court building the feeling among many of the defendants was that they had been abandoned by Spielberg and Marshall. Their anger was expressed in accusations of betrayal, dishonesty and weakness. Only the most trusted insiders were privy to this resentment felt by the Landis people against the Spielberg organization. To the contrary, in the courtroom and elsewhere, James Neal tried to convey the impression that everything was harmonious between Landis and Spielberg. Folsey and Allingham were the most resentful. Their position, never expressed publicly or directly, ran counter to every single tenet in Marshall’s account. They blasted with bitter sarcasm Marshall’s claim of how he first thought that Vic was carrying dummies in the final shot. They derided Spielberg’s man as having been the only one on the set that night who didn’t see the children over on the village shore with Vic Morrow just seconds before the shot started. Recalling the background differently from Marshall, they had him attending two meetings and not one; at one of which, after being specifically informed of Landis’ wish to use real children with explosions and a low-flying helicopter at night, Marshall even had his girlfriend, Kathleen Kennedy, place a blind call to the labor commissioner to see if they could use the kids legally. It was the labor commissioner’s reply that it would be too late at night to permit the use of children, Folsey and Allingham asserted, that set the stage for the illegal hiring. At the second meeting in Landis’ Universal bungalow, they maintained, Marshall told them to “forget it,” with reference to getting proper approval from the labor commissioner’s office to use the kids legally. It was then agreed that the children would have to be hired without permits outside ordinary channels. Because Marshall stayed far out of reach during the trial proceedings, and Spielberg was never even summoned during the entire five-year affair, both sides were spared having the truth of their respective versions put to the test. It served all the wrangling parties concerned in the defense. Any victory could only be “Pyrrhic”; neither side could escape an open confrontation unscathed. Even had Marshall defended his claim that he’d been told doubles or dummies would be used, his argument would only pit his word against Landis’. Marshall’s incriminating connection to the hiring scheme was dramatically corroborated when Marci Liroff, the casting director, testified that upon learning of the illegal plan she had phoned Marshall who “said he would take care of it.” Also, the studio had knowledge that its own Lucy Fisher had specifically mentioned to Marshall her concern about problems with filming the kids this way.

In her debriefing by the man from O’Melveny, Scott Dunham, only days after the accident, she stated that she asked Landis and Marshall on two separate occasions about casting the children’s roles. With regard to Marshall’s explanation of the $2, 000 check prepared by Bonnie Radford and signed by Marshall himself, Folsey labeled it plainly false. “Frank knew what the money was for.” Folsey pointed out that even if Marshall’s and Bonnie Radford’s claim about not knowing the true purpose of the first check was correct, how could they explain the $1, 000 in cash in a sealed envelope that went to the second series of illegal payments? – part of the complex scheme of concealing the illegal cash payments supplied by Warner, a scheme which even the prosecutor failed to understand and was never revealed during the entire five year-long case! What made Folsey angriest was Marshall’s alibi supplied by Dick Vane. Vane knew all along about the concealment plan, Folsey maintained. As location manager, Vane was actually the first on the set to alert him to the presence of Jack Tice. Vane helped keep tabs on the location of the firemen and, according to Folsey, it was impossible for him not to have known about the children for the 2:20 shot. At the time he was called as a witness at the trial, Dick Vane had testified only once before on Marshall’s role in the fatal shot. His account given three years earlier at the grand jury, in fact, was the only time authorities would ever raise the subject of Frank Marshall’s involvement in the illegal hiring. Under oath Vane had testified to the grand jurors that as the cameras began rolling for the 2:20 shot both he and Marshall believed that Vic was carrying dummies. Vane’s sworn testimony was sufficient to keep the investigation away from Marshall. More importantly, it kept the DA’s indictment efforts focused solely on Landis and his group. Along with the NTSB’s Steven Spielberg affidavit, consisting of a one-line statement in which Spielberg indicated he was not on the set the night of the accident, Dick Vane’s story was key in keeping public awareness of Spielberg’s and Marshall’s involvement in the incident to a bare minimum.

Folsey pointed out that Dick Vane was employed by Following an opening torrent, the trial soon settled into a sluggish pace. After a few months the courtroom activity was reduced to Repetition was inevitable among the many witnesses but what bogged the proceedings down were two common legal conventions, the “sidebar” and the 402 hearing, which constantly interrupted the normal course of testimony. Although both maneuvers were originally designed to keep a jury free from prejudicial information, in the TZ case they became the twin tactics used by the defense to take the wind out of many of the most damaging statements witnesses were prepared to offer concerning John Landis. Nothing symbolized the proceedings like the breaks in testimony – the “sidebars” – than the sight of Lea D’Agostino as Mother Goose, indefatigably leading the brood of a half-dozen short-statured defense lawyers towered over by six-footer Braun back and forth to the judge’s side bar. The “sidebars” resulted from the judge’s ruling barring “speaking” objections, that is, those objections in which the lawyer stands up and objects, and then speaks his reasons behind the objection. Under the judge’s ruling all objections in the trial had to be first announced in open court with the actual objection heard privately in whispers to the judge at his “side bar,” so the jury could not hear what was being said. The ^(α)402^(′′) was another dilatory tactic. It allows the defense to request that the jury be kept in the jury room while in the courtroom a witness is being examined and cross-examined; a kind of prescreening, it permits the judge to determine whether the witness might say something about the defendant which could be prejudicial and irrelevant to the specific facts of the case. The logic behind the 402 was that once a witness testifies, you can’t unring the bell. At the TZ trial the defense in particular benefited from 402’s since it gave an angry witness the chance to get things off his chest, so that with his emotion spent, his subsequent testimony before the jury tended to be flattened.

At the TZ trial the defense in particular benefited from 402’s since it gave an angry witness the chance to get things off his chest, so that with his emotion spent, his subsequent testimony before the jury tended to be flattened. As the trial slowly wound on those in the courtroom saw John Landis mostly bent down over a yellow legal pad furiously scrawling. Everybody wanted to know what he was writing, and the curious would perhaps have been disappointed to learn that the sheets he filled day after day for ten months were letters to his wife, each headed with the date and “Dear Deborah.” Between daily sessions, the “Dear Deborah” letters were secured inside the desk of the court bailiff, the LA sheriff who in a rare rapprochement became the director’s best friend in the courtroom. Larry the Bailiff performed little odd services for the famous director and Landis, in return, surreptitiously slipped him small gifts like a National Geographic videotape or an autographed photo of Dan Aykroyd. And when Aykroyd appeared at the trial from the set of Dragnet, which he was then filming, the director introduced them, “Dan, this is Larry.” At other times John Landis’ wife exchanged her freshest baby pics with the beaming bailiff who also had small children. Larry was in turn very helpful in making special seating arrangements for the director’s friends and supporters. Perhaps it was not lost on the director that Larry the Bailiff would stay with the jury during final deliberations as they came to their verdict, guarding them and acting as their sole liaison to the judge and the outside world. While in the courtroom, with a few exceptions, John Landis’ behavior remained under control, his Aunt Gloria, Uncle Ben’s widow, caused concern in Judge Boren’s mind after he spotted her one day emerging from the private chambers behind the courtroom. Aunt Gloria could usually be found in the hallway doling out pieces of hard candy. Her husband had passed away the year before, but as a judge’s wife she continued to use his key to enter areas that were off-limits to the public, including the judge’s elevator and the private parking lot. Following this discovery, Judge Boren hastily called a conference with the defense lawyers to point out the inappropriateness and request that Aunt Gloria return the judge’s key! On rare occasions John Landis emerged in the hallway from his courtroom shell and showed more of his true personal style. In general, he kept the morale up by tirelessly joking and beaming a lopsided smirk.

On rare occasions John Landis emerged in the hallway from his courtroom shell and showed more of his true personal style. In general, he kept the morale up by tirelessly joking and beaming a lopsided smirk. He lost control once when, physically seizing and shaking a frail, studious-looking young photographer, he denounced this individual as the “most obnoxious paparazzi” he’d ever seen. His behavior often strikingly exemplified the “seduction/intimidation” method he had once expounded to his phalanx. Still photographer Morgan Renard on the day he testified got the intimidation treatment. “He used a lot of body language,” Renard recalled. “He sort of moved in front of me, kind of blocking my entrance to the courtroom, so I would have to brush shoulders with him to pass by. And his wife was right behind him. She’s even bigger than he is.” With the person who represented the greatest potential danger of any witness, Landis alternated intimidation with seduction when they met in the hallway; at the time of the trial, Andy House, pressured at Disney over the case, had just lost another job there. “I understand you’re mad at me,” the director said it friendly enough just outside the courtroom – but House felt intimidated; and when next on the witness stand he saw Universal’s Sean Daniel seated in the gallery the thought ran through his mind, “I’ll never work on a feature film at Universal.” The chill felt by Andy House was felt by Alpha Campbell even before the trial. Within minutes after prosecutor D’Agostino paid a visit to her Universal Studios office, Landis’ former secretary suddenly received a series of phone calls from the director she hadn’t heard from since he sent her the box of fancy cookies. She never returned the calls. But the coincidence began to make sense when at the trial on the day she was called to testify she heard Deborah Landis in the hallway refer pointedly loud in her presence to a secretary who sat next to her at her Universal office; “Let’s get Ahuva to come in and say how Alpha is out to get John.” Shocked and angry at what she considered a clear attempt at intimidation by the director’s wife, she nevertheless entered the courtroom and related from the stand how Landis told her to destroy certain copies of the script. Upon her return to her office the following day, Alpha confronted the woman with the Israeli name who sat at the desk behind her. Ahuva didn’t deny being the office leak to Landis. In fact, she warned Alpha that John Landis had friends in high places at the studio and mentioned Sean Daniel. When Alpha reported this brazen example of office surveillance to her superiors, she encountered mixed results; Ahuva was immediately transferred but at the same time Alpha was informed", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634243667_cleaned.txt:323:d2e8eff31cfc", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 1927, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634243667_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634243667", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634243667_cleaned", "chunk_index": 324, "text": "her return to her office the following day, Alpha confronted the woman with the Israeli name who sat at the desk behind her.

When Alpha reported this brazen example of office surveillance to her superiors, she encountered mixed results; Ahuva was immediately transferred but at the same time Alpha was informed that, mysteriously, her entire seventeen-year personnel file had disappeared. A different type of intimidation was brought to bear on the prosecutor whose family had fled the Nazis. Playing on the sense of Jewish persecution, Landis lashed out at her one day in the hallway with a biting, “Schande for the goyim!” James Neal was puzzled until its meaning was explained to him as a Yiddish epithet for “traitor.” Neal liked the phrase, and in the hallway hummed it to a Nashville beat, Schande for the goyim .… Schande for the goyim.… Possibly expecting more indecipherable outbursts from the director, several reporters the next day brought to the hallway Leo Rosten’s Joys of Yiddish. The indisputable mistress of the hallway was Deborah “Nadoolman” Landis. Virtually banned by her husband from the prelim two years before (he kept her away, he intimated at the time, because he felt she didn’t photograph well) Landis’ wife and business partner this time assumed an imposing presence on the 15th floor. She brought pork buns from Chinatown and acted as a kind of social secretary in the affairs of Department 132. With Larry the Bailiff in the courtroom, Aunt Gloria on the judge’s elevator, Deborah in the hallway and the phalanx patrolling everywhere, it often appeared to be a question of time before the Criminal Court building, the entire judicial structure, would fall to the wunderkind in the Twilight Zone case. Monitoring who came and went, and who was talking to whom, Deborah Landis’ chief function appeared to be orchestrating the media. A number of times she joined her husband in taking sudden flight from reporters and photographers, both Landises dashing down the 15th floor emergency stairs as if intent on drawing attention from the press. Craning over the crowd from her great long-legged height, she at times enforced a blackout policy with regard to the press, alerting her husband, for instance, to Folsey’s frequent attempts to speak to reporters without John’s approval. She decided what days were best for supporters to come. On some days she would encourage visitors to stay home, judging it was better that Lea D’Agostino didn’t have a big crowd.

Most of the Hollywood stars in the hallway were familiar faces from Landis movies. Their frequency of visits was in proportion to what Landis had done for them. The careers of stars like Dan Aykroyd and Ralph Bellamy had benefited strongly from the director, being launched in Aykroyd’s case (he appeared in five of Landis’ eight movies) and resurrected in the case of the 73-year-old Ralph Bellamy with the success of Trading Places. It was very nice of the elderly actor to stand behind the troubled young director. Like Vic Morrow, Bellamy appeared grateful to be working again. Personally invited by the director to attend the legal proceedings, Bellamy tried to sell the idea of Landis’ concern for safety by telling the journalists in the hallway that once John Landis had rescued him when he fell on the steps of the New York Stock Exchange during filming of Trading Places. Bellamy came to the trial several more times, echoing Landis’ feelings by grousing that the case was “politically motivated” and “legally upside down.” Bellamy was a favorite with the jurors. They recognized the actor who played FDR in Sunrise at Campobello and, not surprisingly, the court burst into uproar when D’Agostino, angered by Bellamy’s hallway characterizations of the incident at Indian Dunes, sought to subpoena the venerable movie relic. Many in the prosecutor’s own office thought that her attempt to discredit Ralph Bellamy was “tacky.” Though the judge immediately quashed the subpoena, it had the effect, as the prosecutor proudly pointed out, of capturing headlines and upstaging the formidable fact of a famous Hollywood star who supported Landis. The stars who came to the trial were usually brought from Century City to the Criminal Court building and back to Century City in a one-vehicle legal motorcade dubbed by one defense counsel, the “Landismobile.” A long white van leased by John Landis, it transported every day for nearly a year the director and his wife, along with James Neal and Jim Sanders, usually along with a guest or possibly one or another lawyer. The arrival of the white van at the building on Temple Street was a Hollywood occasion; it was often possible to catch coming out of the van not only the famous young director but one or more stars. Dan Aykroyd was one of the better-known names at the trial and a frequent visitor.

The arrival of the white van at the building on Temple Street was a Hollywood occasion; it was often possible to catch coming out of the van not only the famous young director but one or more stars. Dan Aykroyd was one of the better-known names at the trial and a frequent visitor. On his first visit he sported two buttons on his lapel; one button plugged LA’s Hard Rock Cafe in which he was an investor, the other button was for Dragnet, the movie he was then making. For legal reasons Aykroyd refused to comment on the case other than to say that it concerned an “industrial accident.” He spoke in metaphysical terms. “There might be a higher authority involved.” In pure Hollywood tones, ”I love John,” he described the chief defendant as “a superior human being,” vowing, ‘To go to the wall with him. I pray to God that it ends in a positive outcome.” The visits by other young stars probably went unnoticed by a generation of jurors more attuned to Ralph Bellamy or Don Ameche than to the star of Into the Night, Jeff Goldblum, or Michelle Pfeiffer, then filming The Witches of Eastwick, or Randy Newman, the “I Love LA” singer/songwriter and now a first-time co-writer on Three Amigos, or Tony Edwards, the young actor from Top Gun. Even the appearance in the courtroom by Carrie Fisher, Princess Leia of Star Wars, who had a role in Blues Brothers and had been the real-life girlfriend of Dan Aykroyd, probably escaped the jurors. They might have been hard pressed to identify the awkward, plain-looking girl in the above-the-knee dress as Princess Leia, but they would have known Eddie Fisher and Debbie Reynolds, her famous parents. Carrie Fisher visited on the same day Dorcey Wingo took the stand, testifying very much against the wishes of Landis, Neal, and Landis’ wife. Deborah made sure to introduce the pilot in the courtroom to some Hollywood friends. Carrie Fisher happened to be an idol of Wingo’s and he was overwhelmed. “Wow!” he exclaimed as he shook hands with the heroine of Star Wars. The actress carried a book on dramatic writing by Lajos Egri. She was in the middle of writing her memoirs of life with the Belushi crowd to be published the following year. In the courtroom Deborah and Carrie sat together and talked about the case. Carrie Fisher said she had heard from her mother about very gory scenes on movie sets where stuntmen had been “ripped and shredded up.” Deborah confided the key problem their side faced in calling another movie director to the stand. “There are all kinds of directors we could call, but if we did have a director testify you", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634243667_cleaned.txt:326:4e34ff808b6e", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 1930, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634243667_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634243667", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634243667_cleaned", "chunk_index": 327, "text": "the Belushi crowd to be published the following year.

Carrie Fisher never made it to the hallway, not even during recess. Deborah Landis appeared determined to shield her from the press. The end of the day saw her being rushed past reporters out of the courthouse between James Neal and Jim Sanders and safely shut behind the doors of the waiting, revving Landismobile. A lot of the luminaries visiting the trial were drawn from Hollywood’s new generation of studio chiefs and corporate powers. They were quiet and unobtrusive, like Landis’ longtime supporter Jeff Katzenberg, nicknamed the “golden retriever,” president of Walt Disney’s booming film division. Hollywood life went on as usual alongside the trial; Disney had just released The Color of Money and as he sat in the courtroom lending support to his embattled friend Katzenberg happily thumbed through the favorable first reviews of Disney’s yuppie sequel to The Hustler. Landis’ best friend, Sean Daniel, attended often and brought lower-ranking Universal execs. A faithful visitor was rotund, balding Bob Weiss, the corpulent Blues Brothers producer who was doing Dragnet at the time with Dan Aykroyd. One of Hollywood’s new female powerbrokers, Dawn Steel, then Paramount production president, came to the courtroom while in the middle of negotiations to replace David Puttnam as the head at Columbia. Among the visitors from the ranks of Hollywood directors who showed up to offer their moral support was Landis’ loudest advocate inside the DGA’s executive leadership, Jeremy Kagan (The Chosen), and Judith Cates, wife of DGA president Gil Cates and a friend of Deborah Landis, as well as directors Costa-Gavras of Missing, “horror master” Larry Cohen, Paul Bartel (Eating Raoul), Michael Ritchie (Fletch); Tobe Hooper (Poltergeist, The Texas Chainsaw Massacre); Miss Piggy’s creator, Frank o_(Z) (Muppets Take Manhattan) and British television director Jonathan Lynn (Clue).

Deborah Landis brought a costume designer’s perspective to the proceedings. As mistress of the hallway, she helped guide famous Hollywood visitors and kept up a running commentary (“I’m going to write a piece for Vogue on what’s good and what’s not good in a trial.” “This afternoon we have a good witness because he loves John.” “Lea wears a lot of lavender which is a good color for her”…). The appearance by the famous and glamorous at the trial affected everybody, including the press. It struck the young Los Angeles Times reporter whose mother, visiting the trial from Boston, was proudly introduced by her son to Watergate’s James Neal. For AP reporter Linda Deutsch it was the time she misidentified John Landis’ Uncle Sid as Swifty Lazar in a report circulated to hundreds of newspapers. The Hollywood glamour was so overpowering that even the prosecutor’s assistant Tom Budds began to dream out loud. His Twilight Zone investigations constantly threw him in the way of pretty Hollywood women; early in the case, after interviewing Cynthia Nigh one Friday night over a glass of wine, he came back to Kesselman with the glowing report that she was a “dish”; after interviewing Jaqueline Compton, Landis’ former driver, he raved to Lea D’Agostino how “foxy” she was. During the trial he openly fantasized whether it might be possible for one of the defense attorneys to fix him up with a date with Carrie Fisher. The names of celebrities were a constant bombardment on Budds, capped with James Neal’s promise to get him a signed photograph of President Reagan from his Tennessee friend, Howard Baker. But in the end Budds never had his date with a movie star nor the signed photograph of the chief of state. Only a singular piece of memorabilia was to remind him of his glory days in Hollywood. Two years before the actual trial began, he had turned a blind side to department protocol by removing from the helicopter the colorful nose cone with its painted eagle and outstretched talons.

Local network KNBC-TV’s Elizabeth Anderson earned for her solid reporting, muttered, under-thebreath profanities and open sneers from Deborah Landis. The subject of the star-struck syndrome was raised with Neal by one of its dizziest victims, the young Los Angeles Times reporter Paul Feldman – wondering if it was proper for Landis to have all the stars show up at the courthouse; he asked the old pro from Nashville whether it was part of the director’s scenario for the trial. “Paul,” Neal said, looking pensive, “to answer you honestly, I don’t know. My guess is he did not. These people are his friends and I imagine they would call him up and say, ‘I’m coming down,’ and he’d say, ‘Fine,’ and he was grateful for that, and if I were on trial being prosecuted by Mizz De Owgustino, or anybody else, I’d be grateful if my friends showed up.” As part of the trial, the jury members ventured out of the Criminal Court building on three separate occasions. Once they went to visit the Indian Dunes disaster site and on two different occasions, once early in the trial, the other near the end, they left the courtroom to watch the crash footage on the big screen. Each of the excursions was attended by bizarre frills that had come to be expected in the case. The first viewing of the film was bitterly opposed by the defense. The prosecutor had been able to get permission from the Motion Picture Academy of Arts and Sciences to use its prestigious Samuel B. Goldwyn Theatre in Beverly Hills for the screening. The defense felt out maneuvered. Landis was fuming. Folsey, whose father had been a founding member of the Academy, expressed shock and disdain that the organization would lend its approval. He telephoned his aged father immediately. And whether or not as the result of his complaints, or for other reasons, the two oversize Oscars that ordinarily graced the theatre were removed for the Twilight Zone screening. The director’s arrival at the Academy in the Landismobile wasn’t anything like the glitter and flashbulbs on Oscar night. Landis was agitated. Inside the theatre he could be heard loudly voicing technical disagreement with the screen presentation. Before the jury and press arrived, he lashed out at the projectionist, “Don’t you realize they’re trying to put me in jail!” Before the screening took place there had been detailed discussions between the judge and Landis’ attorneys.

The Hollywood people wanted to be satisfied on all the important technical points, from where the jury should sit to how high the volume should be. The jury’s second excursion, to view the crash site, was arranged with some difficulty. The prosecutor’s original idea was to treat the jurors to an elaborate and costly demonstration involving a real exploding village and a low-flying helicopter. In order to prove her point she pursued a zeal for realism that almost matched the director’s own. Investigator Jerry Loeb was turned into a UPM and helped her make the office over into a virtual movie production company where the talk was about budgets, scheduling and insurance. While Judge Boren cut back the spectacular, he permitted the prosecutor to take the jury to Indian Dunes; he deferred, however, making the decision as to whether or not he would permit the jurors to see a low-flying helicopter until he first saw the on-site demonstration himself. It was a critical decision. To have a combat helicopter with its infernal noise hover in the air just over the heads of the jurors was to give them a real feeling for the danger of the scene that was shot on that bedeviled night of July 23, 1982. As a judge, Boren had to consider that it could also be prejudicial: the result was a unique 402 hearing on the bank of the Santa Clara. An actual court was set up on the sand and gravel shore under the trees. The court reporter sat at her stenography machine facing the bluff. On the shore John and Deborah Landis, both in outdoor wear, sweaters and sturdy boots, stood close together holding hands like newly-weds. The helicopter was brought in before the jury arrived; the grim rotor-driven exhibit came clattering over the cliff in front of the judge, the defendants, their attorneys, and a throng of reporters. Suddenly it dropped to a hover position at the same height Wingo’s Huey occupied before it plummeted. The prosecutor again showed her emotions all too plainly. She visibly recoiled. She made a great demonstration of shielding her eyes from the sand and debris kicked up by the propwash. The sight of Lea D’Agostino cowering, almost prostrate with fear, was noted by Judge Boren who canceled the jury view of the helicopter, persuaded, in part, by the prosecutor’s terror-stricken response that the exhibition could be prejudicial.

The actual jury view of the site ended benignly. The jurors would have needed tremendous imagination to picture what had happened on the very site on the night of the final shot five years ago. Without the village, the helicopter, the explosives and the dark night, the bend of the Santa Clara looked like a pleasant picnic ground. The sampan, the No. 4 hut, the dam – none of the structures the jurors had been hearing about in months of trial testimony was there. The spit of sand where Landis directed – the “island” – had been eroded and was barely visible in the shallow river. The smoke burns on the granite wall were washed away and the gas vapors had long since vanished from where the village once stood. In the final act before resting her case, the prosecutor called for a second, and final, big-screen viewing of the film by the jury. It was held on the old Warner lot in Hollywood. After twice viewing the fatal footage on the big screen, the jurors were as shocked as they had been the first time. The fresh screening again heard their deep, disbelieving gasps. The final master shot in which the helicopter’s main rotor blade cuts into Vic Morrow was followed by the same stunned silence and subdued exit. As he was the first Hollywood director to stand trial on manslaughter charges there was the feeling of a historic Hollywood precedent. There was a media mob. The courtroom was packed with Landis friends and family: Aunt Gloria, his mother Shirley Levine, Uncle Sid and his wife; Universal’s Sean Daniel with Landis’ agent Mike Marcus; Dan Goldstine, the Berkeley psychologist, along with the usual flock of junior lawyers and legal secretaries from Joel Behr’s office. The throng in the hallway pressed against the doors of Department 132 to get the best seats. Larry the Bailiff tried to calm them: “I don’t want you coming in here like a herd of cattle.” Meanwhile, he seated Landis’ supporters and legal staff first, almost filling the entire first three rows. He acted like a uniformed usher in a theatre showing a new comedy by the husband of Deborah Landis. Standing with the bailiff at the courtroom’s entrance she watched the courtroom fill. To a late arrival she shrugged, ”I can’t give you a seat.” For a lot of people, it was strictly SRO. Neal had been reluctant to let the director take the stand.

To a late arrival she shrugged, ”I can’t give you a seat.” For a lot of people, it was strictly SRO. Neal had been reluctant to let the director take the stand. But after all the name-calling and negative characterizations by the prosecution he realized that the defense opening required a strong response. In a series of meetings immediately preceding the director’s appearance Neal tried to bring the other attorneys in line. Marked “confidential,” a memo was circulated which listed only John Landis of the five defendants among the small number of defense witnesses to be called. The memo indicated that the singular mention of the director didn’t mean that the other four shouldn’t testify, but the message was clearly understood that Neal wanted only Landis on the stand. Although both Neal and Behr found it difficult to control the disparate parts of the defense machine, the five lead lawyers remained united against Lea D’Agostino. Despite internal frictions, they realized that the jury focus would be on Landis. In fact, after a few weeks it was easy to forget that four other defendants were also on trial. Landis’ appearance on the stand was a strongly charged emotional event. Already the feud between the director and D’Agostino who had breathed fire at him for the preceding six months was legendary. Though Neal led off questioning the chief defense witness, it was really Landis’ encounter on cross-examination with the Dragon Lady that everyone was intensely curious to see. As Neal opened his direct examination of the trial’s most important witness, he read from a list of questions all typed out in perfect order; obviously there would be no surprises. For the jury it was the first time they saw John Landis without his being bent over a yellow legal pad. It was also the first time they got to hear his piercing nasal voice. Addressing the witness in a calm, soothing tone, alternating between calling him John and Mr. Landis, Neal’s direct examination took the 36-year-old director through a perfectly rehearsed tale in which the hero was Horatio Alger. The jury heard how John Landis got his first job as a mail boy in the studio and did odd jobs like working at Hamburger Hamlet in Westwood. He was a waiter and actor; he also had a “job engraving little signs that go in buildings that say where the doctors are.” The story Landis told at Neal’s prompting began with Steven Spielberg telephoning him in March 1982.

Spielberg proposed a dinner meeting. They met and discussed various joint projects, one of which was the concept of creating a movie from TV’s Twilight Zone series. Landis said that after reaching an agreement with Spielberg he went ahead and wrote what would become known as the Landis segment. Under Neal’s supportive questioning Landis mentioned that he was a big fan of Rod Serling. He pointedly remarked to the predominantly minority jury that in his own script he wanted to use the element of fantasy to deal with social issues and that the idea behind his segment was racism as depicted by Bill who lives the lives of his victims. But after distributing the first draft to Spielberg and the Warner people, Landis said he learned that Warner’s Lucy Fisher and president Terry Semel had a criticism of the story. Landis said he met with Fisher and Semel numerous times and that at one meeting, which took place at Semel’s house, they decided to write an additional scene to “soften” Bill. The witness explained how the concept was written into the June 13, 1982 revision, the third draft. Marshall, George Folsey Jr. and Dan Allingham where they discussed the problem of using the children at night. In an account that clashed sharply with what had been spelled out among Frank Marshall’s secret communications with Warner Bros.’ lawyers, the movie director blithely implicated Spielberg’s assistant. Landis testified that Marshall promised he would have someone from his office call the labor board to find out if they could get a waiver for the kids. At a follow-up meeting with the same people present, he testified, Marshall informed the group that the labor board was willing to give a waiver, but only until 8 : 30 P.M . Since it was still light at that time, Landis said, the waiver would not do them any good. Hidden in the director’s chastened response was his use of the first-person plural pronoun. Neal’s mild rebuke substituted the demonstrative for the personal pronoun – ”John, that was wrong” – thus conveying the idea of collective blame; even in this most poignant confession there was the devolution of personal responsibility, a tactic designed not so much against his co-defendants who ultimately could be shown to have followed orders given by the director: “We decided wrongly to violate the labor code” was aimed at Frank Marshall; and by inference at Steven Spielberg.

Having been thoroughly drilled by his lawyers, having for weeks batted questions shot at him from every angle by Neal and Behr, on the stand the director did exactly as his lawyers told him; and his confession of wrong-doing was immediately amended by a “softening” disclaimer. While failing to honor the letter of the law, he testified, he had acted in its spirit both by explaining to the parents what the scene entailed and by asking them to be on the set as guardians for the children. There never was any suggestion or mention of danger, Landis maintained, and even though he discussed the use of dummies or “small people” with Allingham, it was only in connection with the problem they had with the labor code about night shooting. One of the strangest stories he told the court was that not until he heard 1st AD Elie Cohn testify at the trial on the “lower, lower” issue – only a few months ago! – did he realize for the first time that maybe those words were spoken. He said he thought the 1st AD gave the cues over his radio to start the machine gun-firing that prompted the explosions. Even stranger was his denial of having ever been told at a June 16, 1982, casting meeting with Mike Fenton and Marci Liroff that the scene was dangerous. “Absolutely not!” It was impossible, he testified, that he could have even told Liroff at the time how the scene was going to be shot. He told the jurors that he didn’t even know that he was to shoot the scene with real kids in one take without the use of “inserts,” because at that time the budget had not yet been approved by Warner Bros., and he hadn’t even made the decision how to film the scene. The “plan” took up the chief part of Neal’s questioning. Certain key phrases, a “safe distance away,” “the other side of the river” and “camera platform,” were made familiar to the ears of the jurors by being constantly repeated. The director stressed the many meetings and careful preparation of a plan in which the helicopter would be on “the other side of the river” before the final shoreline explosives were detonated. Landis elucidated that once the helicopter was out of the scene on “the other side of the river” it would function as a “camera platform,” filming the shoreline explosions going off.

Landis elucidated that once the helicopter was out of the scene on “the other side of the river” it would function as a “camera platform,” filming the shoreline explosions going off. The jurors were informed that what they had seen on the film was mostly “illusion,” including the enigmatic last-second incident where Vic falls to his knees in the river and Renee is shaken loose from his grip and dropped into the river just seconds before the crash. Landis said that just before the final scene he told the parents “so they wouldn’t be concerned” that Vic was going to stumble. Stating, “I saw Vic fall where we discussed he would fall” literally seconds before the actor was decapitated, he again emphasized the illusionary process of film-making. In the same vein he referred to the 9:30 shot which Jackie Cooper had criticized for showing the kids too close to explosives. The young director explained to the jurors that by using certain camera angles and sound effects it only appeared that Vic and the kids were close to the explosions when actually they were not. With Landis’ calm performance as a witness, it was easy to forget that his trial testimony was wholly inconsistent with what he had told the NTSB almost five years before, and a year later to the grand jury. The only consistent element was his same blanket refusal to accept any responsibility as a director for what had happened on his set. His trial testimony continued and extended the steam-roller strategy first conceived by Joel The “gray-haired eminence” had been able to draw out of the chaotic personality the humanly affecting side. There was vast improvement in the movie maker’s story-telling technique. Unlike Bill in the script, his creator had evolved and become more sympathetic. Under Neal’s gently firm, almost rueful questioning, ran a tone of forgiveness for the prodigal son. Neal skillfully built an evangelical occasion, filled with religious accents from the Bible Belt, with tragedy and joy, sadness and hope. Sometimes a white hanky fluttered from the witness stand and a snuffling sound came through the mike. There were frequent tears from the witness and synchronous ones from a tall, sobbing Hollywood woman in the first row of the gallery who was the young director’s suffering wife… The prosecutor tried to counter the Horatio Alger hero portrayed by Neal with the more pedestrian version of someone who had made it in Hollywood by being very lucky.

Later she would bring up Spielberg one more time, asking the witness about the rivalry between them (“We were not in competition,” the director replied). Under Neal’s questioning the rueful format had permitted little scope for the director’s fund of film lore. But the prosecutor offered him numerous openings to present the fascination of the consummate fan with Hollywood. Some of the movie stories were of special interest to the ethnically varied jury. Responding to D’Agostino’s criticism about his bent for realism in filming, he told of a scene in Trading Places to which Paramount objected because it didn’t want Don Ameche to call Eddie Murphy “nigger.” Landis related how he convinced Paramount to change its mind, pointing out that “nigger” was necessary to show the ugliness of racism. Of the prior testimony that the Landis defense feared most the witness focused on the statements of the casting agent, Marci Liroff, and even more so, that of the cameraman, Steve Lydecker. On the stand Landis denied Lydecker’s testimony in toto. He denied Lydecker’s contentions that the helicopter was not supposed to be in the frame of the final shot, or that live ammunition was used in certain scenes, or that he had ever said to Lydecker, “We may lose the helicopter,” or that he excoriated one of the electricians for being “chickenshit.” He denied “C” Camera assistant Lee Redmond’s account of the incident where he told a cameraman to go home if he didn’t want to do a dangerous shot. He denied that the Wednesday filming was delayed because of interruptions in certain shots caused by the children’s constant giggling. He denied any characterization of himself as using four-letter words and vulgarities or as the “screamer.” He also denied the parents’ allegations that he had not told them about any helicopter or explosions in connection with the use of their children.

Against this tide of denial, the prosecutor chose his claim that Vic’s last-second stumble was planned as conclusive demonstration of the witness’s ability to manufacture stories. For trapped by the fall, Vic, the film showed, lost the opportunity to dive for cover. Moreover, there was nothing in the script calling for Vic to trip. Even Landis’ friend Elie Cohn had testified that he didn’t attend any meeting where a stumble was discussed. One could hear a pin drop during this exchange. The jurors had seen the film and seen Vic’s fall. In the courtroom they saw the director leave the stand to indicate on a map where exactly he and Vic had planned the stumble to occur. “I told the kids Vic was going to stumble.” He even insisted that he had asked both the parents, and the children, if the children could swim. The prosecutor caught him with rapid-fire questioning. Did he tell the helicopter pilot about the stumble? Or Dan Allingham who held the light? What about the 1st AD? And why in five years had he never mentioned the stumble? He answered as he did to many questions that pointed up contradictions with his earlier statements, shrugging: he had never been asked. It would perhaps have been easier to prove from a film maker’s viewpoint that the stumble didn’t make any film sense. It had no logical necessity. The director of photography’s understanding was that Vic was to complete the scene and leave the frame as fast as possible; DP Steve Larner had never heard of a stumble, nor had any of his cameramen. In any event, even allowing that the stumble was planned, it wasn’t planned very well because the little girl slipped from Vic’s arm into the water. But more importantly, everybody knew it was a one-shot take in which a planned stumble would create too many problems. There was no way for Landis to call it off; there was no contingency plan; if in the event of a stumble the children started to behave unprofessionally, like their giggling on the previous night, and they dropped out of Vic’s arm, the shot would be ruined and there was nothing the director could have salvaged. Landis had already told the court that he had been prepared beforehand for his testimony, but the thoroughness of this drill never ceased to be a revelation.

Landis told the prosecutor that it was his method of joking in order to calm people down. In the same casual vein, he explained a different sticky question that had tripped up Kathryn Wooten at the prelim. Without admitting that he knew the final shot was dangerous, as he’d done in confidential interviews with his legal phalanx, he resorted to unverifiable movie lore and testified that his call on the bullhorn asking everyone to stand up was a habit he had picked up in Spain, from the “famous” assistant director Jose Ochoa (who used the practice, Landis said, when filming around heavy machinery). When the prosecutor moved on to show how the movie makers cut corners by doubling up, with Allingham serving both as UPM and 1st AD, Landis denied that it was done for cost-cutting reasons (“It wouldn’t be saving that much”). And after his example of Jose Ochoa, he dipped deeper into Hollywood apocrypha to cite the example of someone who had distinguished himself for doing two jobs at once on the set. His name was Tommy Shaw. “Tommy Shaw,” the jury learned, “always functioned that way for John Huston.” Landis fell back on blanket denial when the questioning turned to a critical photograph that showed the marble-gun shooter standing right next to him, actually Landis’ long-time associate, propman Mike Milgrom, the man he had grabbed by the shoulder as Morrow fell to his knees in the final seconds. The director replied that he “was unaware there was anyone firing a marble gun. At only one point was the trial provided the rare instance of hearing mention of the bouffant-crested general of the phalanx. The name surfaced as D’Agostino brought up Landis’ controversial NTSB interview which showed him going off the record 25-30 times to talk to a lawyer named Joel Behr. She asked Landis why Behr hadn’t taken the opportunity to jog the director’s memory in order to make mention of the “camera platform” and “the plan.” If the director had failed to mention the helicopter’s camera platform role to the NTSB, didn’t he have a second chance to explain it a year later during his grand jury appearance?

It was by force of relentless, non-stop, dive-bomb-type questioning that the prosecutor was able to lay bare the cracks in “the plan.” Landis said that he’d never been told about the mortars inside the huts center stage to all of the action, nor as a director was it important if he knew. Nor had he heard the discussion the SFX men had testified to in which he was quoted as saying he wanted to see the “huts going up.” At another point Landis was stumped and he couldn’t tell her how the SFX men would know what the cue for the plan was. He gave up trying to pinpoint the intended location of the chopper according to the plan; it was “somewhere in the middle of the river, I couldn’t tell you exactly where now.” He resisted any characterization of his set as being dangerous that night; against the most incontrovertible, undeniable and overwhelming evidence, he even insisted “the children were not under a hovering helicopter on my set!!!” When D’Agostino turned to the elaborate concealment plan that night the director admitted knowing about the fire marshal who was also a child welfare worker. He said he simply told his people after finding out about Tice that there was not much they could do about it. He even implied that the studio teacher knew about their presence – “Tice couldn’t have missed the kids.” As for George Folsey’s role in telling Mrs. Chen and Dr. Le to hush up about the children if they ran into any firemen, Landis distanced himself from the actions of his friend, saying he’d first learned about this story when it was testified to in the courtroom. Those who had known the director prior to his appearance in court were flabbergasted by his unruffled performance on the witness stand under the prosecutor’s merciless questioning. His calmness so puzzled the Los Angeles Times reporter who’d come to know him that he asked Neal in the hallway whether Landis had taken a tranquilizer. Neal could only brusquely snort, “You’d have to be a horse’s ass to do that.” At the very end of the chief defendant’s testimony the prosecutor returned to the story of casting agent Marci Liroff.

Nothing seemed to highlight the contradictions in the mass of his testimony more than Liroff s June 16, 1982 handwritten note with the mention of the kids: 2 Vietnamese kids boy and girl (Chinese, Thai or Korean). Again, he couldn’t explain the note. It was one of the strangest ironies that only days before the prosecutor was to begin her long-awaited cross-examination of the director, on February 14, she received a wire from Interpol stating that Frank Marshall’s girlfriend had been detained in Spain. Responding to the request from the LA DA’s office, Spanish authorities strip-searched Spielberg’s partner and treated her like a common fugitive. Kathleen Kennedy’s name was on the Interpol list along with Marshall’s. Marshall would be stopped, too, if he tried to enter Spain where he had been spending a lot of time working on Spielberg’s Empire of the Sun. Suddenly the Interpol message presented the prosecutor with the possibility of finally snaring Marshall. But it was too late. She had closed the prosecution’s phase of the case just a few days before the Interpol wire arrived. Four months had gone by since the district attorney’s office first got Interpol to search for Marshall after he skipped England and thumbed his nose at the brisk lady from the embassy who with Budds was waiting to serve him the subpoena. The idea of going after Marshall was no longer practical. So, when, in a panic Marshall’s lawyer Rick Rosen called Lea D’Agostino, he was able to persuade the prosecutor to lift the hold on Kathleen Kennedy and inform Interpol that she was no longer needed as a witness in the Twilight Zone manslaughter case. The end of the prosecutor’s cross-examination of John Landis, but for a few remaining questions by opposing counsel, brought to an days were left for the other four defendants to decide whether or not to take the stand. Neal planned on calling only a few witnesses before resting his case. Neal’s list was small because many of the witnesses called earlier by the prosecution, like Cohn, McLarty or Wooten, had already provided sufficient evidence to support the defense position. Other possible candidates were rejected because on certain key issues they tended to back up dangerous prosecution witnesses like Lydecker or Schuman. That explained, for instance, why Neal did not call the director of photography, Steve Larner, who in a potentially damaging interview with Neal’s Jim Sanders on the eve of the trial virtually demolished the defense case when he couldn’t recall the use of the helicopter as a “camera platform” in “the plan.” Certain statements", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634243667_cleaned.txt:340:ba94af0746ff", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 1944, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634243667_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634243667", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634243667_cleaned", "chunk_index": 341, "text": "support the defense position.

But most seriously damaging would have been the chief photographer’s insistence on his understanding at the time of the crash that the helicopter was to be above Lydecker’s camera ‘B’ master shot. This affirmation of Lydecker’s testimony, that Landis told him not to worry about the helicopter’s position because it was not to be in his shot anyway, would have dealt another mortal blow to the “plan.” It would have strengthened D’Agostino’s argument that Landis ordered the chopper to fly directly into the SFX explosions in a last-minute, reckless attempt to improve the shot and by inference to those cognizant of the director’s ruling obsession, to “out-Spielberg Spielberg.” The few witnesses Neal did put on presented a strikingly odd combination. The single person from the actual Twilight Zone movie set was an obscure gaffer. Neal called Curtis Hanson, the only other movie director besides Jackie Cooper to testify in the case; Hanson (Losing It, Bedroom Window), Kathryn Wooten’s former husband, was known as sympathetic to the Landis’s dilemma. Neal also called a very surprised Andy Furillo who, after sitting in the press gallery for six months, suddenly learned that he was to become a participant in the drama. Another surprise to the prosecution was witness Robert Frasco, Landis’ private investigator. Neal’s list presented no greater contrast than the “carrot-top” and the executive-looking gumshoe Frasco. Yet both were felt to be important by Neal in order to discredit cameraman Steve Lydecker, the man the phalanx considered to be Landis’ most damaging opponent. Lydecker had been the prosecution’s great hope. He had told the jurors of having been brought into the business by his dad at age nine, of having worked as a stunt double; one of his very first jobs, he mentioned, was stunt double in John Wayne’s Wake of the Red Witch; and of having worked in SFX capacity on Psycho and The Warlords. With a background in guns and hunting he should have demolished Neal’s claim that less lethal “red jets” had been used in the controversial scene disparagingly referred to by the defense as “the banana", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634243667_cleaned.txt:341:04c117392a04", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 1945, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634243667_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634243667", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634243667_cleaned", "chunk_index": 342, "text": "the business by his dad at age nine, of having worked as a stunt double; one of his very first jobs, he mentioned, was stunt double in John Wayne’s Wake of the Red Witch; and of having worked in SFX capacity on Psycho and The Warlords. With a background in guns and hunting he should have demolished Neal’s claim that less lethal “red jets” had been used in the controversial scene disparagingly referred to by the defense as “the banana plant murder.” Lydecker was able to identify from memory the type of live ammo Stewart used by the direction of Landis when marble guns failed to produce the desired mayhem in the banana plant scene; “.12 gauge shotgun shells, Remington SP-High Base .00 buck.” Lydecker’s report of the director’s response to his warning about flying the helicopter too close to the cliff, ”So, we lose the helicopter,” brought Andy Furillo to the stand. Furillo in an article had quoted the master shot as saying that he believed Landis had been joking. On the stand Furillo’s testimony was limited merely to stating whether or not the quote as it appeared in the article was accurate. Neal’s questioning of Furillo must have been bewildering to the jury, if only because, joking apart, Landis denied there having been any discussion at all between himself and Lydecker about flying the helicopter too close to the cliff. Neal called Robert Frasco because the detective had tape-recorded a statement by Lydecker just after the crash which Neal believed favored Landis vis-a-vis the “lower, lower” issue. The detective’s appearance was limited solely to discrediting and thereby neutralizing Lydecker. Neither the jury nor the public at large ever heard the true story of the disaster as it was shockingly laid out in Frasco’s files. Frasco’s testimony consisted of the private eye quoting Lydecker from a lengthy three-hour taped interview done early in the case, brief selections of which were played in open court, in which the cameraman’s knowledge of John Landis shouting “lower, lower” was stated as having come from another cameraman, implying that he had not heard it himself. The only movie director Neal called to the witness stand, Curtis Hanson, was socially close to the Landis circle. Youthful-looking, in his late thirties, he’d dated Folsey’s future wife Belinda, and was the nephew of Jack Hanson of the famous Beverly Hills clothier, Jack’s, Hollywood’s inplace to buy clothes in the 60s. At the trial Neal prompted him to contradict the notes Tom Budds made during his interview with Kathryn Wooten at her Venice Beach home nearly five years before. By his own admission, Hanson had been in and out of the room where the interview took place, yet in his answers he was able to back up with fine detail Kathryn Wooten’s trial testimony in which she retracted all the previous statements she had made to Budds", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634243667_cleaned.txt:342:38948029ece7", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 1946, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634243667_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634243667", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634243667_cleaned", "chunk_index": 343, "text": "clothes in the 60s.

Neal’s final witness was Alan Goldenhar. From a technical standpoint, Goldenhar held an important position on the set as the chief electrician, the gaffer, who set up the crucial lighting for the shots that night. Whenever possible Neal attempted to show that there was always a higher degree of planning on the set than had been indicated by earlier witnesses. The middle-aged gaffer, resembling the jurors in age and manner, in brief and narrow testimony, especially supported Landis’ claim of many “meetings.” The obscure gaffer left the stand and after six days and four witnesses, in addition to Landis, James Neal rested his case. Of the remaining four defendants, three had pretty much decided not to testify in the trial. The decision not to let Folsey take the stand, according to Harland Braun, was reached after video-taped rehearsals showed Folsey projecting a weak image. His high, straining, flutey voice came through wavering and uncertain. In any event, Folsey had not been directly involved with the set during the last night’s shooting. There was not much he could talk about beyond his role in chaperoning the parents that night, leaving it for the prosecution to determine in how far his actions contributed to deceiving Dr. Le and Mrs. Chen, in addition to shielding them from the inquiring eyes of Jack Tice. With Allingham the situation was far more complex since, functioning in something like four jobs that night, he had been pivotal to the operation of the set and, in contrast to Folsey, he would have had very much to talk about. More than any other witness he was the prisoner of previous statements that wholly contradicted everything Landis had told the court concerning meetings, planning and rehearsal. When asked at the grand jury in reference to the rage scene, “Did anyone express concern over the helicopter being blasted by water and fire mortars?” Allingham had coyly replied that all he had heard about complaints afterwards was, “Boy, that was a little warm.” The fifth defendant, Paul Stewart, would have presented an only slightly lesser disaster had he decided to appear in his own defense. Stewart previously had informed investigators of his walking the set with the director and showing him where SFX explosives were placed, in sharp contrast to Landis’ testimony which held that the director didn’t even know", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634243667_cleaned.txt:343:48c8c1906ae6", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 1947, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634243667_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634243667", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634243667_cleaned", "chunk_index": 344, "text": "water and fire mortars?” Allingham had coyly replied that all he had heard about complaints afterwards was, “Boy, that was a little warm.” The fifth defendant, Paul Stewart, would have presented an only slightly lesser disaster had he decided to appear in his own defense. Stewart previously had informed investigators of his walking the set with the director and showing him where SFX explosives were placed, in sharp contrast to Landis’ testimony which held that the director didn’t even know there was an explosive under the lethal hut No. 4! Devastating to Landis’ “plan,” especially one which Landis claimed was actually improved upon after the run-in with explosions during the rage scene, was Stewart’s earliest statement, made more than five years ago, revealing that he had not even been informed of the 11:30 near miss! “Nobody ever said anything about the explosions being close to the helicopter,” Stewart had recalled, and as far as the so-called “rehearsal” was concerned, Stewart informed the NTSB and police, “They could’ve flown through … and they could’ve been turning the camera and I’d never know.” Indeed, except for exchanging a few words with the pilot before the crash, he said he’d never talked with Wingo on the set about the location of the explosives. Keeping at least three of the four witnesses off the stand was not difficult for Neal. Folsey and Allingham, while technically represented in court by Braun and Levine, still sought their major counsel from Joel Behr and their income from Landis, while Stewart’s lawyer Arnie Klein, though distant from Landis’ Hollywood lawyers, was a close friend of Braun and subject to his persuasion. Only Dorcey Wingo, the wild card, fighting for his soul, remained outside the orbit of Century City. Like Folsey, Allingham and Stewart, the pilot represented a Pandora’s box of earlier statements that were both inconsistent with the plan and contrary to John Landis’ trial testimony. But unlike his three co-defendants the pilot’s mouth would not be easily shut and, to the end of keeping him off the stand, a campaign was unleashed whose emotional intensity had not been seen before in the trial. At the time it began, Neal and Wingo’s lawyer were at dagger’s drawn. In fact, on the day John Landis finished his testimony, Eugene Trope jolted Neal and the others by announcing as a near certainty that Wingo would take the stand. The memo suggested the ease with which the prosecutor could turn against Wingo his previous confessions to investigators. It cited Wingo in statement upon statement which flew directly in the face of John Landis’ recent testimony. Each example was followed by pointed comments like, “Contradicts Landis’ testimony of numerous meetings between him and Stewart and Wingo”; “Displays Dorcey’s total ignorance of special effects,” or “Direct contradiction to the testimony of the plan.” One statement alone, according to the authors of the memo,", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634243667_cleaned.txt:344:50860b1356a5", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 1948, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634243667_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634243667", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634243667_cleaned", "chunk_index": 345, "text": "suggested the ease with which the prosecutor could turn against Wingo his previous confessions to investigators.

After a thorough analysis of the pilot’s prior confessions, they concluded bleakly: “Dorcey is not even aware there are fireballs along the shoreline at all, let alone a plan to turn his helicopter and be a safe distance away before the explosions were set off!” At this time, it became impossible to tell by Landis’ familiarity with Wingo that not until very recently had he resumed speaking to the pilot after a four-year hiatus. Landis greeted him like a family friend, “Hello, Wingo.” Dorcey’s wife brought her new-born baby to the trial to be admired by Deborah. The Landises invited the Wingos to Sunday brunch at home on Lloyd Crest. Nevertheless, this onslaught of cordiality fell on stony Oklahoma caution. Despite Wingo’s obvious desire still to work in motion pictures, he was being constantly warned by his lawyer to steer clear of the hospitable Landises. The pilot’s own wry comments on the proceedings were contained in the “court-toons” he doodled while sitting through the endless sessions. Landis noted the pilot’s work approvingly. Perhaps nothing better illustrated the differences between the cowboy-pilot from Oklahoma and the self-conscious Hollywood auteur than a portrait of Landis which Wingo intended to present him as a gift. Like most of the pilot’s art, it contained an element of the grotesque. The movie director criticized this particular “court-toon” for showing him with a “Jewish nose,” and Wingo awkwardly retracted the gift and returned to his sketch pad where he solved the dilemma by drawing a portrait, bespectacled and bearded, but with an unexpected touch of surrealism by depicting the likeness without a nose.", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634243667_cleaned.txt:345:0fc00be79a48", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 1949, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634243995_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634243995", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634243995_cleaned", "chunk_index": 0, "text": "As with cannabis in the ancient world, Frankincense was a prized exotic substance and preserved generally for ritual use, or by royalty.

And it has been suggested that even in modern church rituals, the mild mood elevating effects of this may help to create a religious state of mind in parishioners close enough to inhale its effects. However, this alleged effect has been hard to reproduce in any notable way under clinic conditions. Luck noted this, explaining that “No two kinds of frankincense… have exactly the same effect. There are many varieties, coming from different regions along the ancient incense route, and some of the more potent ones may not be available any more.

Cannabis History Uncovered in the Desert Sands of Arad n June of 2020, in the midst of a world seized and distracted by a I pandemic, and the twitter account of an American President gone mad, some revelatory headlines passed through the world’s news agencies. Considering the implications of these headlines regarding the origins of some of the world’s oldest and largest religions, they fell short of the sort of impact they might have held in less intense times. The Journal of the Institute of Archaeology of Tel Aviv University, Volume 47, May 28, 2020 – Issue 1, published the paper “Cannabis and Frankincense at the Judahite Shrine of Arad,” by Eran Arie, Baruch Rosen & Dvory Namdar. The article was based around the analysis of unidentified dark material preserved on the upper surfaces of two altars that were used at a 2,800 year old Jewish temple site. The temple in question was located in a larger fortress complex in Jerusalem, known as the ‘fortress mound’ of tel Arad, which had guarded the Judahite kingdom’s southern border. The initial excavations of the site took place between 1962−1967 by the Institute of Archaeology of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, however, the research indicating the role of cannabis at Arad, relied on technologies of analysis that have only come into their role in archaeology more recently. • Newsweek – Cannabis Discovered in Shrine From Biblical Israeli Kingdom May Have Been Used in Hallucinogenic Cult Rituals • BBC – “Cannabis burned during worship” by ancient Israelites – study • Popular Archeology – New research reveals Cannabis and Frankincense at the Judahite Shrine of Biblical Arad • The Times (UK) – Judean worshipers were high on cannabis, archaeologists reveal • Haaretz – Ancient Israelites Used Cannabis as Temple Offering, Study Finds: Analysis of altar residue shows worshipers burned pot at a Judahite desert shrine – and may have done the", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634243995_cleaned.txt:0:d58dfa45d287", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 1950, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634243995_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634243995", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634243995_cleaned", "chunk_index": 1, "text": "Have Been Used in Hallucinogenic Cult Rituals • BBC – “Cannabis burned during worship” by ancient Israelites – study • Popular Archeology – New research reveals Cannabis and Frankincense at the Judahite Shrine of Biblical Arad • The Times (UK) – Judean worshipers were high on cannabis, archaeologists reveal • Haaretz – Ancient Israelites Used Cannabis as Temple Offering, Study Finds: Analysis of altar residue shows worshipers burned pot at a Judahite desert shrine – and may have done the same at the First Temple in Jerusalem “The new evidence from Arad shows for the first time that the official cult of Judah – at least during the 8th century B.C. – involved hallucinogenic ingredients.

The temple is in the top right, the inner Holy of Holies where the shrines were located would have been in the enclosed room, in the far back right corner. Arad is marked as a Jewish archaeological site, not just through its location, but rather due to archaeological finds of numerous inor 7th century BCE, when the kingdom fell to the Assyrians, or just before they fell again to the Babylonians a century later. Most of these unscripted clay shards detail administration activities, however one ostraca, housed and displayed at the Israel Museum reads “the house of YHWH,” i.e. a place of worship dedicated to the Hebrew God, likely in reference to the shrine located within the fortress. Iron Age temples in the region were commonly built on an eastwest axis and generally held a courtyard, a main prayer hall and a small, raised inner room: the holy of holies. Due to its similar structure, the temple site in the Arad fortress is seen by researchers as a sort of miniature Holy of Holies, the inner chamber of the Temple of Jerusalem, where the High Priest conferred with God. The “cella’” inner chamber of the Temple at Arad, as reconstructed at the Israel Museum from the original archaeological finds. The larger altar on the left held residues of frankincense and the smaller altar on the right cannabis resins.

On the other altar, cannabis substance was mixed with animal dung to enable its mild heating.” Based on the finds unearthed here and in comparison with other Near Eastern temples it was concluded that the cella was the heart of the shrine; it was therefore termed “Holy of Holies” or debir. The Arad shrine was compared to the First Temple in Jerusalem … and it seems that the two indeed share similar architectural characteristics (e.g., the east−west axis and the division of the architectural spaces). This may allude to similarity in cultic rituals performed in these structures. Today, the Muslim holy places atop the Temple Mount make that site inaccessible to archaeologists, so Arad, as well as other similar shrines across the Levant, have functioned as sort of proxies for scholars to study and understand the structure and functioning of the first incarnation of the Temple, of which almost no extra-biblical evidence is known. (David, 2020). Within the Holy of Holies at Arad, archaeologists discovered a standing stone, with possible indications of a second, that is believed to be a “massebah” a ritual object that would have represented the deity within the shrine, alongside the two limestone altars that contained the residues of frankincense and cannabis. Interestingly, the altars had been placed on their sides and purposely buried under a plaster floor when the temple had been decommissioned from use around 700 BCE The altars had residues from the resins of material burnt upon them, which due to their deliberate burial and the dryness of the desert, were considerably well preserved. These residues were submitted for analysis at two unrelated laboratories that both used similar established extraction methods. As the original paper on this discovery noted: On the smaller altar, residues of cannabinoids such as Δ9 -tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), cannabidiol (CBD) and cannabinol (CBN) were detected, along with an assortment of terpenes and terpenoids, suggesting that cannabis inflorescences had been burnt on it. Organic residues attributed to animal dung were also found, suggesting that the cannabis resin had been mixed with dung to enable mild heating. The larger altar contained an assemblage of indicative triterpenes such as boswellic acid and norursatriene, which derives from frankincense. The additional presence of animal fat – in related compounds such as testosterone, androstene and cholesterol – suggests that resin was mixed with it to facilitate evaporation. These well-preserved residues shed new light on the use of 8th century Arad altars and on incense offerings in Judah during the Iron Age.

These well-preserved residues shed new light on the use of 8th century Arad altars and on incense offerings in Judah during the Iron Age. The authors believe the evidence suggests “that the use of cannabis on the Arad altar had a deliberate psychoactive role. Cannabis odors are not appealing, and do not justify bringing the inflorescences from afar. The frequent use of hallucinogenic materials for cultic purposes in the Ancient Near East and beyond is well known and goes back as early as prehistoric periods.… These psychoactive ingredients were destined to stimulate ecstasy as part of cultic ceremonies. As shown in this study, 8th century Judah may now be added to the places where these rituals took place.” The indications are that hallucinogenic incensety of substances likely came into use. The 2014 paper “Tracking Down Cult: Production, Function and Content of Chalices in Iron Age Philistia,” (which was co-authored by Dvory Namdar, one of the co-authors on the paper analyzing the altars from Arad) identified hallucinogenic properties in this context in their chemical analysis of artifacts believed to have been used for burning incenses: The significant lipids identified show that the Philistine chalices were used for heating incense and evaporating psycho-active compounds. As opposed to their relatively free-style construction patterns their use seems to have been uniform, related to ritual contexts. The “mother” compound – trimyristin – is highly abundant in plants that are known to cause hallucinogenic effects when inhaled or digested.… We therefore suggest that the chalices were used as incense burners, in which an oily bed was liquefied in order to help evaporate the hallucinogenic substances (Gadot, Finkelstein, Iserlis, Maeir, Nahshoni,Namdar, 2014). For as long as there has been civilization, there have been mind-altering drugs. Alcohol was distilled at least 10,000 years ago in the Fertile Crescent, about the same time that agriculture took hold there. Elsewhere, for example in Mesoamerica, other psychoactive drugs were an important part of culture. But the ancient Near East had seemed curiously drug-free – until recently. Now, new techniques for analyzing residues in excavated jars and identifying tiny amounts of plant material suggest that ancient Near Easterners indulged in a range of psychoactive substances. Recent advances in identifying traces of organic fats, waxes, and resins invisible to the eye have allowed scientists to pinpoint the presence of various substances with a degree of accuracy unthinkable a decade or two ago (Lawler, 2018). Archaeologist David Collard, who discovered evidence of ritual opium use in Cyprus, dating further back than the first millennium BCE, has noted that “The archaeology of the", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634243995_cleaned.txt:3:cb57574658ca", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 1953, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634243995_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634243995", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634243995_cleaned", "chunk_index": 4, "text": "of plant material suggest that ancient Near Easterners indulged in a range of psychoactive substances.

Archaeologist David Collard, who discovered evidence of ritual opium use in Cyprus, dating further back than the first millennium BCE, has noted that “The archaeology of the ancient Near East is traditionally conservative.” More recently the paper “Opium trade and use during the Late Bronze Age: Organic residue analysis of ceramic vessels from the burials of Tel Yehud, Israel” (2022) identified the likely ritual use of the poppy in the Holy Land. “Organic residue analysis was conducted on various vessels from burials at Tel Yehud, Israel. The analyses led to new reliable evidence for the presence of opioid alkaloids and their decomposition products. This research revitalizes a decades-old discussion on the presence and function of the opium trade across a cultural region of utmost significance in the Ancient Near East” (Linares, Jakoel, Be’eri, Lipschits, Neumann, & Gadot, 2022). The first known mention of the opium poppy in antiquity is found on Sumerian clay tablets written in Cuneiform script c. 3000 BCE.… The tablets were found at Nippur and describe the cultivation of the opium poppy.… The Sumerians named opium ‘Gil,’ (happiness), which is a term still applied to opium in certain world cultures today.… The Assyrians, like the Sumerians, collected poppy juice early in the morning by scraping the poppy capsule with an iron scoop and placed these collections in clay vessels.… The ancient Egyptians cultivated their own opium poppies in Thebes called opium thebaicum and thebaine. This opium was generally restricted to priests, magicians and warriors, and was associated with religious cultism.… Evidence of the poppy harvest is known from the New Kingdom period in Egypt and the LBA in the Levant. It is possible that various jewels, such as gold earrings and pendants discovered in tombs, symbolize the poppy capsules… On the island of Crete a ceramic figurine of a female deity with her hands raised and a crown wrapped around her head was found. The crown is adorned with three poppy-shaped grooves.… The goddess’s face is seen in a state of intoxication, suggesting that opium was used as a hallucinogen during a ritual. A gold seal ring found in Burial Circle A in Mycenae, attributed to the 16th–15th centuries BCE, shows the goddess holding the three poppy capsules (Linares, Jakoel, Be’eri, Lipschits, Neumann, & Gadot, 2022). The Haaretz article states that Linares, the head researcher on the paper about the opium vessels, feels that the fact these vessels “once held opium points to the importance to the ancient Canaanites of the substance in the mortuary rituals – and perhaps other aspects of life.” As", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634243995_cleaned.txt:4:5e46ac784118", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 1954, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634243995_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634243995", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634243995_cleaned", "chunk_index": 5, "text": "gold seal ring found in Burial Circle A in Mycenae, attributed to the 16th–15th centuries BCE, shows the goddess holding the three poppy capsules (Linares, Jakoel, Be’eri, Lipschits, Neumann, & Gadot, 2022). The Haaretz article states that Linares, the head researcher on the paper about the opium vessels, feels that the fact these vessels “once held opium points to the importance to the ancient Canaanites of the substance in the mortuary rituals – and perhaps other aspects of life.” As the Haaretz article further explains, “the opium may have been intended for use both by the dearly departed to ease their passage into the next world, and also by the living, who may have actually consumed it at the funeral or during commemoration ceremonies to achieve an ecstatic state and commune with the dead (or think they were communing with the dead)” referring to the speculations of co-author on the paper Be’eri. Interestingly, opium residues were also recovered at a burial site in Megiddo, and this may give some indications how it was used in mortuary rituals. In “Transformations in Death: The Archaeology of Funerary Practices and Personhood in the Bronze Age Levant” Melissa S. Cradic has noted a number of lamps found in a tomb at a Northern Israeli site, “importantly, residue analysis from one lamp unexpectedly yielded morphine-derived compounds”: The enclosed space of the tomb chamber may have facilitated morphine consumption through fumigation. The presence of such a powerful and disorienting psychotropic substance inside the tomb carries important implications concerning the ritualistic, symbolic, and sensorial aspects of the funerary sequence during close encounters with the dead. In the wider region, the presence of opium has been documented during the Bronze Age in Egypt, and it is also known from residues of opium alkaloids in Cypriot Base Ring juglets to a limited degree.… Two Base Ring juglets were found inside [the] Tomb…, possibly providing additional indirect evidence of the presence of opium in this funerary context. Although the use of psychedelic drugs in funerary contexts is not currently known in the second millennium B.C.E. Levant, the presence of mind-altering drugs in other sacred spaces in the Levant and globally has a long history that contextualizes the presence of opium in the mortuary realm. A ceramic storage jar from the temple courtyard at Late Bronze Age Kamid el-Loz, for example, contained ten liters of Viper’s Bugloss (Echium linné), a powerful hallucinogen.… Beyond the Levant, botanically derived psychoactive drugs have been found in diverse mortuary contexts spanning several millennia and continents (Cradic, 2017). Many researchers have suggested that Hebrew references to Gall, (as with the “wine to drink, mixed with gall” given to Jesus on the cross) were an adoption of the suggested Sumerian name for the opium poppy noted by the authors “Gil.” But both of these designations have been hotly disputed.

Many researchers have suggested that Hebrew references to Gall, (as with the “wine to drink, mixed with gall” given to Jesus on the cross) were an adoption of the suggested Sumerian name for the opium poppy noted by the authors “Gil.” But both of these designations have been hotly disputed. As it stands, there is no confirmed word for the opium poppy in either Akkadian or Sumerian texts, there have been suggestions in the past, but those are now widely rejected, as Barbara Böck has noted “It seems that Papaver somniferum is absent from the cuneiform record or the plant is hidden behind one of the many plant names that cannot be identified” (Böck, 2021). Similar statements have been made about cannabis and the linguistic identifications challenged. However, as with the archeology of Arad, this new evidence has also confirmed the ritual use of opium in the Holy Land. Similarly, there have been etymological, or linguistic claims about evidence of cannabis, interpreted from ancient texts, including the Bible. However these have been generally dismissed or overlooked by the wider academic community. As with the evidence of ritual opium use at Tel Yehud, the archaeology out of Arad now provides physical proof of cannabis’ ritual role in the ancient Near East and these claims should now be harder to ignore. Eran Arie, curator for archaeology of the Iron Age and Persian Pe-riod at the Israel Museum in Jerusalem, which now houses the on the altars from Arad, stated in an interview with Haaretz on the evidence of ritual cannabis use at the site: “This may reflect the cultic activities in Jerusalem, in Judah and possibly in the broader region,” he says. “If the shrine at Arad was built according to the plan of the Temple in Jerusalem, then why shouldn’t the religious practices be the same?” Co-author Dvory Namdar, a chemist and archaeologist from the Volcanic Agricultural Research Center, also see this use as likely indicating a mainstream practice which had been officially sanctioned and financed by the monarchy of that time. The authors of the paper are not alone in this respect. Yifat Thareani, an archaeologist from Hebrew Union College in Jerusalem, who read the paper with great interest, is in agreement with the authors’ view that cannabis likely played a role throughout the region. “We don’t have remains from the First Temple so we can only assume what kind of cultic activity went on there,” she says. “But there are enough indications from Arad to give us a sense, or in this case a smell, of how the rituals in Jerusalem were performed.” (Quoted in Haaretz) The species also has a number of medicinal properties, from which the best known is its pain relieving ability, especially pain", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634243995_cleaned.txt:6:98a22bf20624", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 1956, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634243995_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634243995", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634243995_cleaned", "chunk_index": 7, "text": "likely played a role throughout the region. “We don’t have remains from the First Temple so we can only assume what kind of cultic activity went on there,” she says. “But there are enough indications from Arad to give us a sense, or in this case a smell, of how the rituals in Jerusalem were performed.” (Quoted in Haaretz) The species also has a number of medicinal properties, from which the best known is its pain relieving ability, especially pain associated with childbirth. In Africa, the Sotho smoked the leaves and other parts of the plant for this reason.… In Morocco, midwives used the smoke of cannabis to induce abortion in pregnant women wishing to terminate their pregnancy…. In the archaeological record, in a cave dated to the 4th century CE in Jerusalem, remains of a 14-year-old girl who died during labor were found, with the skeleton of a 40-week fetus trapped in her pelvis. A juglet with black material in it was retrieved near the skeletons. The analysis of the dark material revealed the presence of Δ6 -THC, an acid catalytic by-product of Δ1 -THC and cannabidiol (CBD). Zias et al. (1993) concluded that the purpose of feeding the cannabis to the girl (by inhalation) was to increase the force of uterine contractions and to reduce birth pain. In this case, there were indications of both burnt, and topical use of cannabis. Besides evidence cannabis was burnt for medical purposes at Bet Shemesh, a balm of cannabis had been rubbed on the girl’s pelvis. This indicates a record of about 1200 years of known use of cannabis in the region, extending into the first centuries after Christ. In both this 4th century CE find from Bet Shemesh Jerusalem, and the 8th century BCE find in Arad, it is also interesting to note that a refined resin product was in use, not raw leaves or flowers. [P]ollen analysis carried out on samples taken from both altars by Dafna Langutt (Tel Aviv University) concluded that no plant material was preserved on the Arad altars. In fact, no cannabis seeds or pollen remains are known from archaeological contexts in the Ancient Near East, as opposed to northeast China or southeast Russia, where all parts of the cannabis plant and seed were found at different archaeological sites and contexts and were dated as early as 2000 BCE…. Therefore, we suggest that cannabis female inflorescences may have been imported from distant origins and were transported as dried resin (commonly known as hashish). As the authors of the original paper have noted “The very high price of frankincense, and presumably that of cannabis, reinforces the assumption that the fort of Arad was an official institution, owned by the Kingdom of Judah. Being part of the kingdom administration, the residents of the fort could have had the resources to obtain such precious materials.” Indeed, the precious", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634243995_cleaned.txt:7:e8b0816e067b", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 1957, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634243995_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634243995", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634243995_cleaned", "chunk_index": 8, "text": "inflorescences may have been imported from distant origins and were transported as dried resin (commonly known as hashish).

Being part of the kingdom administration, the residents of the fort could have had the resources to obtain such precious materials.” Indeed, the precious spice road, bringing in exotic goods to the region, is believed to have passed through Arad, and this is a likely avenue that both the cannabis and frankincense took in reaching the ancient Israelites as there are no indications that it was grown in the region at that time, but rather came as a finished and refined product. The researchers identified other chemicals in their analysis, and this indicated that both the cannabis and frankincense had been mixed with other ingredients, likely to help them burn better. In the case of frankincense animal fat was used, and with the cannabis resins, animal dung, a common fuel in the iron age, was combined. The fat would have helped achieve the high temperature of around 260 degrees Celsius at which frankincense releases its aroma, while the dung would have burned the cannabis at a lower temperature, below 150 degrees Celsius, which is necessary to activate the drug’s psychoactive compounds. Fire it higher and all you get is soot. Eran Arie explains that “If they just wanted to make the temple smell nice, they could have burned some sage, which grows in the area of Jerusalem… Importing cannabis and frankincense was a big investment that could not be made by some isolated group of nomads, it required backing from a powerful state entity.” It is believed that both the frankincense and cannabis traveled from afar, along ancient spice routes, as a refined product, likely dried resin, Arie suggests a hashish like product. Likewise with the frankincense, collected from Boswellia trees and this came via traders from southern Arabia. Over and above being a temple site, Arad was positioned as both a major military fortress at the border of the kingdom as well as a stronghold that protected the spice road caravan trade that passed through the region, bringing precious goods to the kingdom. “Frankincense comes from Arabia. Therefore, the presence of frankincense at Arad indicates the participation of Judah in the south Arabian trade even before the patronage and encouragement of the Assyrian empire. Arad provides the earliest evidence for frankincense in a clear cultic context. Frankincense is mentioned as a component of the incense that was burned in the Temple of Jerusalem for its pleasant aroma” (David, 2020). Unfortunately the potential psycho-activity of the frankincense at Arad was not explored in the paper on the altar residues.

Unfortunately the potential psycho-activity of the frankincense at Arad was not explored in the paper on the altar residues. Aromatherapy expert Susanne Fischer-Rizzi noted: “We once called all herbs burnt as incense ‘frankincense’” (Fischer-Rizzi 1990). “The article now known as frankincense is the resin called thus, a common, inodorous article, little better than common white rosin. The article once so highly valued … must have been some other drug more precious than pine or spruce resin.” Today the word frankincense has come to specify the gum resin from the North African tree Boswellia and Fischer-Rizzi, points out that this modern source also contains psychoactive properties, and is still used in churches to instill a chemically induced feeling of religious awe: In the last few years, scientists have grown interested in frankincense. They were intrigued by reports that inhaling certain fragrances became addictive for some people, such as altar boys. Some members of the Academy of science in Leipzig, Germany, found in 1981 that when frankincense is burned, another chemical is produced, trahydrocannabinole. This psychoactive substance expands the subconscious. Scholars have long debated why the temple at Arad was decommissioned and its ritual objects, like the two altars, carefully buried. Some believe this was a way to protect the holy place ahead of the invasion of Judah by the Assyrians around 701 B.C.E., triggered by a failed region-wide revolt spearheaded by the Judahite King Hezekiah. However, the shrine’s closure seems to precede the Assyrian onslaught by a few years, Arie notes, meaning that it is more likely connected to the religious reforms that were carried out by Hezekiah in the early days of his reign, just around 715 B.C.E. According to the Biblical account, which finds some support in the archaeological record, Hezekiah attempted to centralize the cult of Yahweh at the Temple in Jerusalem and ordered the destruction of competing holy sites throughout his kingdom. Acting on his orders, the Israelites “tore down the high places and altars throughout Judah, Benjamin, Ephraim, and Manasseh, until they were all destroyed” (2 Chronicles 31:1) (David, 2020). The excavator of Arad assumed that the two altars (and the entire shrine) were deliberately buried for ritual reasons…. The motivation for this cultic interment is debated.

Our results cannot side with any of these theories, but the very good preservation of the organic material on the altars does indeed reinforce the assumption that they were intentionally interred. • A metal object, possibly for holding the burning coals, was removed from the head of the sacrificial altar; • The standing stone ( הבצמ ( was laid on its side; • The incense altars were buried below the floor of the debir (“holy of holies”); • No remains of cultic paraphernalia or votive offerings were found, implying that they were removed. Curiously, Herzog left out mention that female pillar figurines associated with Asherah, were also discovered from the tel Arad temple. As noted by archaeologist Dr. Elizabeth Bloch-Smith in ‘Judean Pillar Figurines, 8th century BCE’: “While most figurines derive from household contexts, examples also come from tombs, the Arad temple, and public buildings.” One reason that suppression of the site has been suggested is that Arad holds evidence of polytheistic cultic activities and that besides the two altars at the site, there are indications originally there were two standing stones, and this reconstruction brought about the conclusion that two deities were worshiped at the shrine, and this has suggested to some researchers, a divine couple. Ziony Zevit, an American scholar of biblical literature and Northwest Semitic languages, and a professor at the American Jewish University, explained in The Religions of Ancient Israel: A Synthesis of Parallactic Approaches: “Evidence for the worship of more than one deity, usually in the form of redundant or paired appurtenances such as altars, stands, and steles, is indicated at the temple of Arad XI (ninth century) … Dan (eighth century) … Hazor XI (tenth century) … Lachish (end of tenth century) … Megiddo (end of tenth century)…. My own interpretational preference for the phenomenon of “twoness” … is to consider it a reflection of the worship of YHWH and Asherah, lord and lady of the Israelite pantheon” (Zevit, 2001). [Emphasis added]. This is interesting in light of the clear evidence that shall be discussed, that for large periods of Israeli history, the region was polytheistic, and Yahweh was coupled with a Goddess, Asherah.

Interestingly, even prior to the study of the altars, tel Arad had long been viewed by many scholars as a site indicating the combined worship of Yahweh and the Goddess as Asherah. This has been seized upon by religiously biased historians and archaeologists in response to claims that the ritual use of cannabis in Arad, were indications of what took place within the Holy of Holies in the temple of Jerusalem. The evidence of ritual cannabis use at Arad, is seen here instead as further evidence of polytheistic heresy, and a reason for the original sites ‘ cancellation and burial. Hezekiah did what the LORD said was right…. He broke the memorial stones and cut down the Asherah poles. At that time the Israelites burned incense to the bronze snake made by Moses. This bronze snake was called “Nehushtan.” Hezekiah broke this bronze snake into pieces. Hezekiah trusted in the LORD, the God of Israel. There was no one like Hezekiah among all the kings of Judah before him or after him. He was very faithful to the LORD and did not stop following him. In relation to the serpent referred to in this passage, it is worth noting that Asherah is referred to as the “lady of the serpent” in second-millennium B.C.E. inscriptions. The Hebrew Bible’s narrative is clear, these monotheistic renovations were directed against the worship of the Goddess, and this was also what they taught led to the fall of their kingdom. “All this took place because the Israelites had sinned against the Lord their God…. They set up sacred stones and Asherah poles on every high hill and under every spreading tree. At every high place they burned incense … they … made for themselves two idols cast in the shape of calves….” (2 Kings 17:7-17). The solution to avoiding such punishment had been made clear “Break down their altars, smash their sacred stones and cut down their Ashera poles. Do not worship any other god, for the Lord, whose name is Jealous, is a jealous God” (Exodus 34:13-14). And again: “By this, then, will Jacob’s [figuratively speaking of Israel] guilt be atoned for, and this will be the full fruit of the removal of his sin: When he makes all the altar stones to be like limestone crushed to pieces, no Asherah poles or incense altars will be left standing” (Isaiah 27:9). Both the archaeological record and the words of the Bible itself indicate that the worship of a Mother-Goddess was an early integral part of the religion of ancient Israel", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634243995_cleaned.txt:11:f4e35c7da3e7", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 1961, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634243995_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634243995", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634243995_cleaned", "chunk_index": 12, "text": "this, then, will Jacob’s [figuratively speaking of Israel] guilt be atoned for, and this will be the full fruit of the removal of his sin: When he makes all the altar stones to be like limestone crushed to pieces, no Asherah poles or incense altars will be left standing” (Isaiah 27:9). Both the archaeological record and the words of the Bible itself indicate that the worship of a Mother-Goddess was an early integral part of the religion of ancient Israel for centuries. Throughout the region, finds of countless goddess figurines, ritual objects, alongside other iconography, offer indisputable evidence that goddess worship was practiced throughout ancient Israel. Many studies on Asherah in the Bible have concluded that Asherah was a popular and beloved Mother-Goddess in the religion of Israel. Asherah was regarded as a benevolent, divine kingship (also known as the “Queen of Heaven”) who bestows abundance and protection to the people. The human queens were in charge of Asherah’s worship and hosted her priests. The worship of Asherah, as the Book of Kings itself disapprovingly attests, was conducted within the Holy Temple itself alongside the worship of Yahweh – “And the carved image of Asherah that he had made he set in the house of which the Lord said to David and to Solomon his son, ‘In this house, and in Jerusalem, which I have chosen out of all the tribes of Israel, I will put my name forever’“(2 Kings 21). Although biblical authors cast worship of this divine spouse as idolatry leading up to sin, this characterization was contrary to the prevalent cultic religion in the early days of Israel. This portrayal was intended to preserve the appearance of monotheism. It suited the spirit of religious reform that prevailed in the days of the seventh century king Josiah that abolished all divinities other than Yahweh. This monotheistic outlook took central place in the edited version of the Bible. Essentially, biblical editors presented a new, more stringent cult, in which monotheism was present from the beginning of time, when in fact it was not (Daniely, 2022). The worship of Asherah was popular with the people, but opposed by a faction of kings and prophets in Jerusalem who were devoted exclusively to Yahweh at the First temple in Jerusalem. Most people didn’t actually worship at the temple, it was reserved for elites and royals. It was these same people who composed the The Hebrew Bible. The general population worshiped in small community shrines, or at a site like that at tel Arad. During periods when they held power, this Royal cabal sought to abolish the worship of other deities, particularly Asherah.

It had been some time since I had delved into the topic prior to the discovery of cannabis resins at Arad, but the acceptance of this unavoidable reality, due to increasing archaeological evidence of Goddess worship in ancient Israel, seems to have now won the day. It is generally now accepted by the majority of historians and archaeologists that Yahweh was initially not a monotheistic figure, and like other deities of the Near East headed a pantheon and was coupled with a Goddess. Throughout the many centuries that this popular goddess was worshiped, her mythology combined and overlapped with that of other Near Eastern goddesses (Astarte, Anath, Astargatis, etc.) making it hard at times to see a historical distinction between them. Anat and Astarte were considered to be the daughters of Asherah. The renowned Judaic scholar Raphael Patai was amongst the first to note that together this trinity represented the different aspects of the Triple Goddess, i.e.: Virgin-Maiden-Crone, but he is far from alone in this view. Both in the texts of the Hebrew Bible and “in Canaan there is a tendency for the distinctive functions of the three goddesses to fuse together” (Gray 1969). “It can be assumed that the three goddesses mentioned represent different developments of the motif of the feminine generative power as something divine and important for the continuation of life and the community” (Rinngren 1973). All three of these goddesses were worshiped by the ancient Semites at different times throughout the Biblical period. However Asherah is clearly the most prominent in the Hebrew Bible narrative. Anat is mentioned only once, Astarte just a few times, whereas the term Asherah appears over 40 times. Combined with this is a trove of artifacts from the Kingdom period that attest to her popularity in that era. Complicating things, there are various regional names of the Asherah, such as Elat and Athirat in Canaan, along with titles like Qodesh (Holy One).

As well, regionally Asherah’s origins have been connected with other ancient goddesses, such as Ishtar, Ishara, Cybelle, the Egyptian Hathor and others. “[W]e have to keep in mind that in polytheistic cultures the prevalent tendency often was to identify one god with another, or call one god by the name of another, as we know from many examples in the Egyptian, Babylonian, Hittite or Canaanite religions…” (Patai 1990). Raphael Patai, believed that this factor led to some confusion in the Biblical narrative, and at times this caused Asherah to appear under alternative names such as Ashtoreth, the Goddess introduced to Solomon by his foreign wives in the Hebrew Bible narrative (1 Kings 11:33). “There can be little doubt that it was the worship of Asherah, already popular among the Hebrews for several generations, which was introduced by Solomon into Jerusalem as part of the cult of the royal household, for his Sidonian wife” (Patai 1990). Despite these name variations, and overlapping Goddesses “the one variety of worship in which the Israelites engaged more frequently than any other was the cult of the Goddess Asherah, symbolized and represented by her carved wooden images [Asherah poles]” (Patai 1990). were worshiped right along side Yahweh, with Asherah being referred to as his consort. “Recently discovered tenth-century B.C.E. inscriptions from Judea invoke the blessing of Yahweh and his Asherah testifying to their combined cult” (Gaddon 1989). As we shall see further, the temple at tel Arad testifies to this relationship as well. In much later Hebrew Bible times, during the age of Prophets like Jeremiah, the Hebrew priesthood became particularly incensed with the worshipers of the Goddess, as her cult successfully competed As William G. Dever, the American archaeologist, Hebrew Bible scholar, and historian, noted in his 1984 article, “Asherah, Consort of Yahweh? New Evidence from Kuntillet Ajrfid,’” the silence regarding Asherah as the consort of Yahweh in the existing Hebrew Bible narrative, “may now be understood as the result of a near-total suppression of the cult by 8th-6th century reformers” (Dever, 1984). Ellen White, Ph.D. (Hebrew Bible, University of St. Michael’s College), formerly the senior editor at the Biblical Archaeology Society, likewise explains, in her article “Asherah and the Asherim: Goddess or Cult Symbol?” despite the denial that causes some to view “the idea that Yahweh had a wife disturbing, it was common in the ancient world to believe that gods married and even bore children.

This popular connection between Yahweh and Asherah, and the eventual purging of Asherah from the Israelite cult, is likely a reflection of the emergence of monotheism from the Israelites’ previous polytheistic worldview” (White, 2021). Most references to “asherah” appear as a symbol of the goddess in the Biblical narrative, and one that is clearly rejected and prohibited. The Israelites are repeatedly commanded by god to chop down the asherahim, break it into bits, and burn it. Scholars say this was either a “living tree, or a wooden pole” (Dever, 2013). However half a dozen times Asherah appears as a personal name, such as when the Goddess is coupled with the Canaanite god, Baal. Patai, Dever and other scholars see a direct attempt to bury the Goddess Asherah, by the original authors and editors of the Hebrew Bible texts. Certainly they do not match the archaeological record, which fully attest to her prominence and popularity with the Israelite people. Similarly, William Dever’s book Did God Have a Wife? (2005) compiled archaeological evidence, such as inscriptions and the numerous clay female figures found throughout Israel and known as ‘pillar-base figurines’, due to their sturdy bases, as clear indication of the popularity of Goddess worship in the region throughout the Biblical age of kings. Dever explains that Asherah’s position was as the goddess and consort of Yahweh, and she was recognized as the “Queen of Heaven.” Dever specifically points to the shrine of tel Arad and the indications there of polytheistic practices, two altars, standing stones, as well as figurines of the goddess recovered at the site, as evidence of the combined worship of Yahweh and Asherah. “The only goddess whose name is well attested in the Hebrew Bible (or in ancient Israel generally) is Asherah” (Dever, 2005) Dever is a revisionist, who sees the Hebrew Bible texts as put together by a handful of male elites after the fall of Jerusalem, and in no way representative of the history and beliefs of the past they purport to record. The Hebrew Bible narrative handed down to us, is more like this cabal’s patriarchal wet dream as to how things should have been in their minds. Monotheism was not the original state and from about 1200- 600 BCE Israel was polytheistic. This is what archaeology clearly shows and this is the standard mainstream view among academics now.

This four-tiered cult stand, from the 10th-11th century B.C.E., found at Taanach is thought to represent Yahweh and Asherah, with each deity being depicted on alternating tiers. It is widely recognized that the bottom and upper middle tiers depict a goddess, probably Asherah. The identity of the deity represented by the empty lower middle tier is not as clear. Numbers of researchers believe that it is an early representation of Yahweh, who was not supposed to be depicted pictorially or as a graven image, but this leaves the problem of identifying a deity who is not there. On tier two, which is dedicated to Asherah, is the image of a living tree, often thought to be how the asherim as a cult symbol was expressed. Photo: ⊝ The Israel Museum, Jerusalem/Israel Antiquities Authority (photograph by Avraham Hay). The Taanach stand, almost two feet high is capped by a shallow basin to contain the incense…. The identity and relationship of the deities on this complex tableau is controversial. Holladay suggests that the first and third tiers represent two aspects of Asherah, the second and forth Yahweh. One of the principle epithets of the Canaanite goddess was “Lion Lady.” In Israelite culture, the tree was her most important iconic form. Holladay views the empty space on the second tier as the aniconic representation of Yahweh, the bull calf with the sun disc as his iconic form and the Temple of Solomon his house… If we accept Holladay’s reading,1 the imagery on the Taanach stand reveals a syncretic cult in transition, the combined cult of a God and goddess, not that of a god and his consort. Her symbols are the aniconic tree and the fully anthropomorphic form of the nude female. Yahweh is present in both his invisible form and in his manifestation as bull calf. On the third register a pair of heraldically arranged goats nibble from a stylized tree flanked by two lions who look much like those on the bottom tier. In the center of the upper register, a calf with a sun disk on its head stands between a pair of volutes that represent columns like those described at the entrance of Solomon’s temple (Gadon 1989).

They date from between the 9th century BCE to the early 6th: the Iron Age II up to the Babylonian Period” (Tully, 2011). Almost all of them have been found broken at the neck, and this has caused some to see evidence of purposeful destruction, such as through the reforms indicated in the Hebrew Bible narrative, and that which took place at tel Arad – a time period which fits with their disappearance. Others have suggested such breakage is typical of artifacts in general, and others yet, that they contained prayers or messages and the object had to be broken to deliver the message. In the case of acting as a ritual envelope, this does “not… contradict the idea of Judean Pillar Figurines also representing a goddess who intercedes with a more remote god because if to break is to send, then figurines are still fulfilling the mediating/communicating role. The figurines could very well represent Asherah as a messenger and/or mediator; a more approachable, sympathetic divine figure, a bit like Mary is thought to be in Christian belief” (Tully, 2011). Approximately 1000 examples of Judean Pillar Figurines ( JPF) are known. These female figurines, standing roughly six inches tall, have a pillar-shaped body (no legs indicated), either hollow or solid, with prominent breasts encircled or supported by the arms. Heads are either mold-made with distinctive features and short curly hair or simply pinched to form indented eyes and a protruding nose. Vestiges of paint on some figures indicate colored facial features and adornment with bracelets or necklaces. Surprisingly, these figurines are a predominantly Judean phenomenon, with the greatest numbers from Jerusalem (405), and sites along Judah’s borders to the north (Tell en-Nasbeh, 143 examples), to the south (Tel Beer Sheva, 43 examples), and along the western border with Philistia (Tell Beit Mirsim with 37, Bet Shemesh with 30, and Lachish with 29). While most figurines derive from household contexts, examples also come from tombs, the Arad temple, and public buildings. Early examples date to the late tenth or ninth century BCE but the figurines greatest popularity and distribution dates to the eighth century BCE. Few seventh century BCE examples survive. The prominent breasts suggest a connection to lactation and by extension to infants’ welfare.

Accordingly, the figurines are interpreted as either fertility goddesses, most frequently Asherah or Astarte, or as sympathetic magical items to promote fertility in general and lactation and infant survival more specifically. While female figurines are known from all periods, the sudden appearance of these figurines in the late tenth or ninth century and their widespread distribution in the eighth century are surprising. Why would Israelites in the ninth and especially the eighth century BCE manufacture a figurine depicting a female goddess or a talisman? And why might the practice taper off and cease in the seventh or early sixth century? (Bloch-Smith, 2008). The potential variety and the lack of exclusivity in cultic matters is illustrated by the later sanctuary (late 8th c. B.C.E.) in the Arad fortress…. There, pillar figurines of goddesses, which were typical for Judah and belong to the realm of local production and piety, were found on the surrounding deposit benches of the sacrificial altar in the courtyard. These clay figurines originated during the second half of the 8th c. and found great appeal during the 7th c. They display a goddess who is not identifiable by name (Asherah?) in a bell shaped skirt who supports her breasts. In the niche of the temple there stood a standing stone (or perhaps two of them) and two incense altars. The standing stone(s) and the pillar indicate that multiple deities in different forms (as a standing stone, anthropomorphically as a goddess supporting her breasts, and also zoommorphically) were represented at the temple of Arad, which must be regarded as a local temple of YHWH during that time. In any case, the figurines speak against the generalized conclusions about the anionic character of the religion of Judah during the monarchic period (Oorschot & Witte, 2017). However, the Biblical descriptions do offer some indications of Asherah’s popularity with the wives of kings and women in general throughout the Biblical narrative, and this is indicated by archaeological finds as well. Dever suggests that one of Asherah’s primary functions was the role of a protector of pregnant women. He bases this assertion on cultic sites of Dan, Kuntillet’ Arjud, Schechem, and particularly Arad as well figurines and pictorial representations of the Goddess, along with other artifacts retrieved from these sites.

In this respect, we should note again the use of medical cannabis as an aid in child birth from the later 4th century CE archaeological find in Bet Shemesh, noted in the previous chapter, as well as more ancient references from Egypt, indicate a long standing knowledge of cannabis effectiveness in this area of women’s medicine in the ancient world. The Eber’s Papyrus, circa 1550 BC, one of the oldest and most important medical papyri of ancient Egypt, prescribes cannabis and honey “to cool the uterus and eliminate its heat” during childbirth. This use was likely widespread in the ancient world. In Women and Cannabis Medicine, Science, and Sociology (2002) the authors affirm that “archaeological, and written records substantiate that the plant was often used to treat female ailments, such as dysmenorrhea, ease labor, alleviate morning sickness/ hypermesis gravid arum, and/or facilitate childbirth in places such as: Ancient Egypt, Judea, and Assyria…” (Russo, et. al. 2002). A History of Jewish Gynaecological Texts in the Middle Ages, records a medieval Hebrew medicament for pregnancy that contained cannabis called the “Head Shield,” which included cannabis alongside nard, saffron, frankincense, cassia and other exotic ingredients came down through the medieval Rabbis Sheshet, and Yehudah Harizi. It is unknown if this was based on earlier medical recipes. (Barkai, 1998). This figurine may represent Asherah, the “one of the womb.” According to myth, Asherah gave birth to the twin gods Shahar and Shalem, (who represent dawn and dusk). Other symbols of Asherah on the amulet including the sacred tree with goats nibbling on it, appear on the goddess’ thigh. The figurine was probably an amulet for women in childbirth. It is likely a necklace such as this, that was condemned by the prophet Hosea, when he demands that Israel remove the “adulterous look from her face and the unfaithfulness from between her breasts.” Hosea 2:2). This unfaithfulness was a symbol of Asherah worn at the end of a necklace by the female Hebrew worshipers of the goddess. A galling sight to the god whose name is Jealous. To the polytheistic Hebrews fertility was fostered by sacred sexuality, a theme that will come to light more when we discuss Solomon’s “Song of Songs.” Sacred sexuality was the domain of Asherah. In fact many of the traditional sexual taboos of the Hebrew Bible, likely came about in reaction to the cultic activities of the worshipers of Asherah. The Canaanite [and Near Eastern] pantheon … included goddesses, such as Ashera, consort of El and Baal, She … was a nature deity, symbolizing sexuality and fertility.

In some passages in the Hebrew Bible there are references to an asherah as a wooden pillar, an object of cultic devotion.… All of … [the] gods and goddesses worshiped by Israel’s neighbors near and far were intimately and organically related to nature and the various forces and powers encountered there. For the most part they appeared in male/female pairs and were pictured in the myths and legends creating the world by copulation. They had special responsibility for fecundity and fertility of all sorts of conditions. Their worship apparently required a kind of imitative magic in which male and female devotees yoked their bodies sexually and spilled their seed upon the field they desired to yield bounteous crops. Orgies involving the use of intoxicants and indiscriminate sexual activity played an important part in these cults, and many Israelites gladly became apostates to these weird and wondrous religions. The inexperience of the nomadic Hebrews in the task of agriculture in their new homeland made them easy converts to the local Baals who promised good harvests. The exotic character of the cult with its mystic roots extending far back into antiquity, together with the highly sensual pleasures afforded in the worship, combined to make it an attractive type of religious experience. Any such temple in modern society would encounter no difficulty in attracting large numbers of devotees… (Cole 1959). It has been suggested that the orgiastic worship of Baal and Asherahin this context, began with the introduction of the date palm – a dioecious tree with sexes in separate trees, requiring fertilization by man’s intervention, or by that of cherub nature daemons (wind, birds, bees etc.), thus making the relationship analogous to human sexuality in the mind of primitive people (Smith 1927). This is also particularly true in association with cannabis, which as we have documented played a major role in the Canaanite cult, and like the date palm is dioecious, having two very distinct sexes. Cannabis can be more easily interpreted as the sacred tree on the Asherah pendants above, than the date palm. each year for the seeds of the next generation, unlike the date palm, which grows larger, year after year, resulting in continually standing groves. Thus hemp is a far more likely candidate for the crop which continually required, in the minds of the ancient Near Eastern fertility cult, orgiastic rites of sympathetic magic.

It is also known that “number of traditions developed around the hemp harvest that involved rituals based on intoxication from the volatile resins and oils”(Emboden 1972). The addition of sexual license developing at such pagan rituals does not take a lot of imagination. As the anthropologist Sula Benet noted: Since the plant was associated with religious ritual and the power of healing, magical practices were connected with its cultivation.… The odor of … hemp is stimulating enough to produce euphoria and a desire for sociability and gaiety and harvesting of hemp has always been accompanied by social festivities, dancing, and sometimes even erotic playfulness (Benet 1975). The profession of harlot carried no stigma in Sumerian times, or in Babylonian … temples were staffed by priests, servants, and artisans, and by a number of highly respectable priestesses and nuns, often from the best families, as well as sacred prostitutes who acted as congenial intermediaries between worshiper and deity. The exact purpose of sacred prostitution is obscure; it may well have had its origin in fertility rituals. But by historical times, the sacred prostitutes’ earnings accounted for a substantial part of the temples’ income (Tannahill 1980). This was a widespread cultural trait throughout ancient western Asia. The sanctuary of Aphrodite at Old Paphos on Cyprus “was 1922). “Foreign as the notion is to the modern religious consciousness, the worship of Ishtar and Tammuz was a fertility cult in which union with the hierodule [temple prostitute] consecrated to the service of the goddess was thought to have magical functions and powers. Such hierodules could be either male or female … the singular kadesh in I Kings 14:24 is to be taken as a collective, meaning ‘hierodules as a professional caste’ who were ‘in the land,’” (Dynes, Percy, Johansson, and Donaldson, 1990). This popularity was for a very good reason, this being that in some regions all women were obliged to go to the temple and there partake of the ceremony of fertility by acting as a prostitute and donating the money made to the temple funds.

Indeed, up until recent centuries in India, which has been discussed for its profound similarities to the ancient Near eastern cults, “many girls were dedicated to the temple where they carried out this social and religious duty, which is the gift of love. They received a careful education, including music, dancing, and erotic techniques” (Danielou 1992). Further, the male “client” who had ritualized sex, and paid for it with donations to the temple, was performing a sacred act of worship. In the Old Testament the word qedesim means the male practitioner of temple prostitution, while the feminine ones are described as qedesot, temple prostitutes … the institution … had an important part to play in the fertility cult. The Old Testament prophets direct harsh criticism against the custom, for example Amos 2.7: “son and father both go into the same prostitute”; Hos. 4.14: “men go aside with harlots, and sacrifice with cult prostitutes”; Jer 2.20: “under every green tree you bowed down as a harlot.” Classic authors such as Herodotus, Strabo, and Lucian also attest that sacral prostitution was a custom in the whole north-west Semitic area in their time (Ringgren 1973). Cult prostitution existed from the earliest times: “Time after the time the prophets denounced Israelite women for following Canaanite practices; at first, apparently, with the priests approval – since their habit of dedicating to God the fees thus earned is expressly forbidden in Deuteronomy xxiii. 18.” (Graves and Patai 1963) In Monarchic times the Hebrew Bible condemnations against prostitution are only directed against that of a cultic nature, and has nothing to do with the morality of the issue. “That there was little or no prejudice against purely secular prostitution in Israel seems relatively clear … Judah lay with Tamar, thinking she was a harlot (Genesis 38). Rahab, the whore of Jericho, was singled out for remembrance and praise. Jephtah, the judge of Israel, was the son of a harlot, who despite evil treatment from his half brothers who were of legitimate birth ( Judges 11), rose to prominence in Israel and was used by Yahweh” (Cole 1959). Further, even the active condemnation of cultic prostitution was only periodical, and as often as not the temple prostitutes are present in the kingdom.

In later times the male cult prostitute even penetrated onto the grounds of the Temple of Jerusalem itself! We come full force into what anthropologists call ethnocentricity, or cultural bias when we deal with the ancient and common practice of cult prostitution. The very term prostitute is misleading, although money certainly did change hands at these temples. Like the opinions of the Yahwists of old, which so strongly impressed the morality of our modern era, our cultural experience of prostitution is a world away from the fertility rights practiced in the Fertile Crescent. It is difficult for us to imagine a world in which sex wasn’t felt to be such a rarefied and private act and it is important to convey how different these people’s conceptions of their actions were from our own. Cult sex at the temple was the duty of every member of the culture and as such carried no stigma with it. Our own cultural bias can be seen amongst many of the scholars of ancient western Asian societies who rarely touch on the subject of the ancient fertility rites, and when they have it has generally been in reference to their ‘heinous’ nature. As in the difficulty in obtaining scholarly information about the use of hallucinatory and psycho-active plants in ancient cultures, in trying to discover more about these central and obviously important fertility rituals, over and over again one finds but the scantiest references to them in books on the ancient Near East. Because we have been taught to think of sex as sinful, dirty, titillating or even prurient, the possibility that sex could be sacred, may seem shocking. Even stranger in a world where female genitals are sometimes described as “cunts” (one of the most obscene swear words in the English language), is the idea that women’s bodies – and particularly women’s vaginas – could be sacred (Eisler 1995). In traditions that go back to the dawn of civilization, the female vulva was revered as the magical portal of life, possessed of the power of both physical regeneration and spiritual illumination and transformation.… Far from being seen as a “dirty cunt,” woman’s pubic triangle was the sacred manifestation of creative sexual power. And far from being of a lower, base or carnal order, it was a primary symbol of the powerful figure known in later Western history as the Great Goddess: the divine source of life, pleasure and Love (Eisler 1995).

The ancients saw in the sexual relationship of man and woman, the very secrets of creation itself, and in taking part in that relationship as a part of their religious worship, they felt that they themselves were taking part in the divine drama on a cosmic scale. “Through their bodies, these temple prostitutes, associated with such goddesses as Hathor, Ishtar, Anath, Astarte, and Asherah, offered access to the divine, a pathway to wholeness and unity with the One” (Hutchison 1990). “Thus, in the Sumerian narrative of Gilgamesh, hailed by scholars as the first Western epic, we read that a woman (whom translators alternately call a ‘love-priestess’ of the Goddess, a ‘temple-whore,’ or a ‘temple courtesan’) transforms the wild Enkidu from a beast to a human being by having sex with him – thereby helping him ‘become wise like a god’”(Eisler 1995). “Hesiod said the sensual magic of the sacred whores or Horae ‘mellowed the behavior of men’. Ishtar, the Great Whore of Babylon, announced, ‘A prostitute compassionate am I’” (Walker 1983). In these temples, men were cleansed not sullied, morality was restored not desecrated, sexuality was not perverted but divine… The original whore was a priestess, the conduit to the divine, the one through whose body one entered the sacred arena and was restored. Warriors, soldiers, soiled by combat within the world of men, came to the Holy prostitute … in order to be cleansed and reunited with the gods.… As the body was the means, so inevitably pleasure was an accompaniment, but the essential attribute of sexuality, in this context, was prayer(Metzger 1985). There are many references to this practice within the house of Israel throughout the writings of the prophets. Hosea is very open about it: “the men themselves consort with harlots and sacrifice with shrine prostitutes” (Hosea 4:14). He even makes a reference to the celebration of the New Moon Festival, for which Yahweh will “devour them in their fields” (Hosea 5:7). Here again we see the Israelites participating in the pagan fertility rituals out in the fields under the new moon mimicking the sexual union of the gods and goddesses, to bring fruitfulness to the land and to themselves. The Hebrew hostility towards homosexuals was particularly dithe goddess Ashera, challenging the more patriarchal priests of Yahweh for popularity with the ancient Semites. The Hebrew Bible refers quite clearly to these ancient priestly transvestites, who were known as the qedeshim, “holy ones,” and alternatively as kelabim, or dogs. “The epithet ‘dog’ is not necessarily a term of abuse, but merely descriptive of their manner of copulation” (Allegro 1970).

Qadesh is the singular and qedeshim, the plural and the terms are also translated with a K instead of a Q. The Hebrew here translates as “holy one,” however, Biblical translators have rendered it “sodomite” in the past (as in the King James Version). Many modern bibles translate it as “male cult prostitute.” As we read in 1 Kings 14:23-24, of the “disobedient” Israelites: “They … set up for themselves high places, sacred stones and Asherah poles on every high hill and under every spreading tree. There were even male shrine prostitutes in the land.… Evidently, male cult prostitutes were a common phenomenon throughout the years of the monarchy, with some kings supporting them and other kings exterminating them. They went hand in hand with the phallic symbols of pillars and Asherim [Asherah poles], the worship on the high places, the exaltation of fertility and sexuality” (Cole 1959). …It is a key term for understanding the Old Testament references to homosexuality. It occurs as a common noun at least six times (Deuteronomy 23:18, I Kings 14:24, 15: 12 and 22:46, 11 Kings 23:7, Job 36:14). It can also be restored on the basis of textual criticism in 11 Kings 23:24 ( $\\stackrel { \\cdot } { = }$ Septuagint of 11 Chronicles 35:19) and in Hosea 11:12. They all ostensibly designate foreigners (non-lsraelites) who served as sacral prostitutes (hierodules) in the Kingdom of Judah and specifically within the precincts of the first Temple (ca. 950-622 B.C.). That these men had sexual relations with other males and not with women is proven by Hosea 4:14, which castigates the males exclusively for “spending their manhood” in drunken orgies with hierodules, while their wives remained at home, alone and unsatisfied, and by the reading of Isaiah 65:3 in the Qumran manuscript: “And they (m. pl.) sucked their phalli upon the stones.” Their involvement in the Ishtar-Tammuz cult – an obvious rival of the monotheistic Jahweh religion-is responsible for the Biblical equation of homosexuality with idolatry and paganism and the exclusion of the individual engaging in homosexual activity from the “congregation of Israel,” which persists in the fundamentalist condemnation of all homosexual expression to this day. …To understand that the condemnation of the kadesh was a cultic prohibition and the self-definition of a religious community, not a moral judgment on other acts taking place outside the sphere of the sacral, it is necessary to see the kadesh or male hierodule (with the kedesha", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634243995_cleaned.txt:25:c320d9c18caf", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 1975, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634243995_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634243995", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634243995_cleaned", "chunk_index": 26, "text": "homosexuality with idolatry and paganism and the exclusion of the individual engaging in homosexual activity from the “congregation of Israel,” which persists in the fundamentalist condemnation of all homosexual expression to this day. …To understand that the condemnation of the kadesh was a cultic prohibition and the self-definition of a religious community, not a moral judgment on other acts taking place outside the sphere of the sacral, it is necessary to see the kadesh or male hierodule (with the kedesha as his female counterpart) in his historical and cultural setting, as a part of Northwest Semitic religion on the territory of the Kingdom of Judah down to the reforms of King Josiah (622 B.C.). The commandments forbidding male homosexual activity on pain of death in the Holiness Code (Leviticus 18:22 and 20:13) were added only in the Persian period (first half of the fifth pre-Christian century specifically). Critical scholarship generally dates the Holiness Code to the beginning of that period, but Martin Noth in his major commentary Leviticus (Philadelphia, 1965) ascribes this part of Leviticus to a time slightly after 520 B.C, ., when the new and reformed Jewish religion set about throwing off all the associations believed responsible for the catastrophe of 586 B.C., the destruction of the first Temple and the exile of the population of Judah to Babylon. The proof of the later origin of the verses indicated above is the prophetic reading (“haphyariih”) for the portion of the Torah including Leviticus 18, namely Ezekiel 22: 10-1 1, a comparison of which shows that Ezekiel was alluding to a text which in the final years of the First Commonwealth began with Leviticus 18:7 and ended with 18:20, as if to say “You have committed every sexual sin in the book.” While there are those who maintain that the Levitical references condemn all male homosexual acts, the character of the Holiness Code suggests that it had the sacral aspect of the sexual liaison in mind (Dynes, Percy, Johansson, and Donaldson, 1990). The qedeshim dressed in multi-colored caftans, and may have worn veils over their faces. They maintained the Temple grounds and sacred groves as well as creating ritual objects, such as pots and weavings. Besides their ritual homosexuality, to the horror of the ancient priests of Yahweh, the qedeshim employed self-wounding and flagellation in a sacred dance, in order to reach altered states of consciousness. They also utilized cannabis, in the form of ointments and incense, as means of achieving shamanistic ecstasy, and there are indications that this was practiced by some of the regional counterparts, such as the transvestite kurgarrus who served Ishtar and the Gallus of Cybelle, who shall be discussed. “The qedeshim were condemned by the Israelites on four accounts.

First, they were mostly Canaanites, although biblical passages suggest that a number of Jewish men and women may have forsaken Judaism to become qedeshim and qedeshtu [feminine]. Second, they worshiped the Goddess and her male consort rather than Yahweh, or Jehovah. Third, they were effeminate, dressing in feminine attire and behaving in a gender-variant manner. Fourth, they engaged in cultic eroticism and, more specifically, in same-sex eroticism” (Conner 1993). Having sex with either the male or female cult prostitutes of Asherah was believed to bring the ancient worshiper into intimate contact with the goddess herself. It is believed by some scholars that the qedeshim may have used anal-intercourse as a means of achieving shamanistic trance. Conner states that this “practice will be familiar to students of Indian tantra. Gay male practitioners of tantra employ anal intercourse to stimulate the kundalini, the serpentine Goddess of Wisdom, in the body of the receptive partner”(Conner 1993). Conner quotes Samuel Terrien on the qedeshim, “The function of the male prostitutes … was related to an ecstatic … divination technique.” A statement echoed by W.L. Moran who commented that the qedeshim “may well have obtained his oracular function through sophisticated techniques of sexual trance.” It has been suggested that the use of intoxicants also played a role in such rites, and this is indicated in ancient literature as well, as shall be noted. We see a similar connection with the use of cannabis and other psychoactive substances in Indian Tantric rites, which are thought to go back to much more ancient times. Homosexuality was a very common trait in shamans of tribal peoples, worldwide, who believed that these people, who had characteristics of both sexes, were somehow also living in two worlds, and could travel between the two. The messages “channeled” by these ancient diviners was taken as authoritative advice by the chieftains and the tribe. In this sense, the Shamans acted as the conscience or mind of the whole group. The Goddess Cybelle’s original Phrygian priests, known as Gallus, or Galli, assumed women’s clothing after a sacrificial castration, the gender transfer being a form of worship of the Goddess by identification. “We know that the Phrygian tribes … during the 1st millennium BCE were weavers of hemp (and possibly imbibers of intoxicating hemp preparations)” (Merlin, 1973).

Referring to the visionary dream which was said to awaken the Gallus to their new identification with the Goddess, Randy P. Conner commented; “It is possible to see the … drinking or eating of special substances as a fated occurrence that triggered the awareness of one’s destiny. Such experiences were said to cause an individual to experience sophrene, to ‘recover one’s senses’” Conner 1993). Recent archaeological finds have established that Cybelle was worshiped among the Thracian tribes, who were known for using cannabis to attain mystic states, especially amongst their own transvestite shamans. Interestingly, certain male functionaries of Cybelle and Attis’ cult were known as cannophori, which has usually been translated as “reed-bearers,” but linguistically, with “canno,” this may have implications of “cannabis-bearers” instead. As William Bell noted more than a century and a half ago of this: “The Latin name of cannabis, perhaps rectius cannevas, as the Italian name is cannevacchio (our English canvass was made from it) would connect it with … the cannephoroi…” (Bell, 1852). Archaeological evidence shows the Phrygian culture from which the religion arose used hemp (Abel 1980). Likewise, with Inanna the ancient Mesopotamian goddess of love, war, and fertility, who overlaps with Ishtar over time, and possibly also in origins. Ancient Babylonian records refer to large amounts of cannabis being delivered to the temple of Eanna, in Uruk which was dedicated to her. As with these other Goddesses, she had her own cultic prostitutes, both male and female. A branch of transvestite priestesses known as gala served in Inanna’s temple. Male-born individuals who became gala sometimes adopted female names and their songs were composed in the Sumerian eme-sal dialect, which, in literary texts, is normally reserved for the speech of female characters. Similar cannabis-using transvestite worshipers of the Goddess, known as Enaries, could be found amongst the Scythians, who were closely related to the Thracians, referred to above, and who possibly picked the cultic practice up from contact with the Galli, or alternatively carried it on from an even earlier identical source. It has been recorded that the Scythians believed that the feminine characteristics of the shamans was punishment from the Great Goddess for desecrating her shrine at Ashkelon in Israel.

Interestingly, as we have been discussing Goddesses and cannabis, a Scythian tomb found by the Russian archaeologist Sergei Rudenko that held the implements for fumigating with cannabis, in the form of a tent bowl and brazier with rocks, that held the carbonized remains of burnt cannabis and its seeds, also held a carpet, pos- The only deity shown in Scythian art was the Great goddess whom the Greeks called Artemis, or Hestia or Gaea (The Earth) … Scythians were governed by priestess-queens, usually buried alone in richly furnished Kurgans (queen graves).… The moon-sickle used in mythical castrations of god was a Scythian weapon. A long handled form therefore came to be called a scythe, and was assigned to the Grim Reaper, who was originally Rhea Kronia in the guise of Mother Time, or Death – the Earth who devoured her own children. Scythian women apparently used such weapons in battle as well as religious ceremonies and agriculture” (Walker, 1986). Walker’s comments regarding the use of the scythe and agriculture, can be particularly applied to the Scythians favorite and most versatile crop, cannabis hemp, as the long handled scythe with its curved blade, is particularly well designed for harvesting hemp, enabling the harvester to cut the hemp along the soil line thus preserving its long fiberous stalks. One thing that differentiated the sites of the tombs of Royal Scythian Queens, with that of the kings, is the complete lack of human sacrifices. A 1995 episode of The National Geographic Explorer, “The Frozen Siberian Tombs,” profiled a dig centered around a recently discovered Kurgan, and the program televised such things as an over 2,000 year old hemp shirt, weaved as fine as silk; A beautifully embroidered and decorated bag, used for holding marijuana; And an exotic Persian rug, testifying to wide ancient trade routes. In the case of the Scythians, we are not only dealing with male to female transvestism, but also female to male, and it is now believed that some Scythian tombs thought to have been those of male warriors, may in fact have been females, in traditionally male attire. Scythian women in general had a reputation for fighting in battle alongside their men.

The mental breakdowns, suicides, and unstable relationships that have been attributed to homosexuals in past decades, have little to do with the collective mental state of those who choose to tread “gaily” down the path of life, and far more to do with local cultural pressures from a rejecting society that has been strongly influenced by Judaic-Christian homophobic views. “Homosexuals in many societies are not incompetent, but they may be such if the culture asks adjustment of them that would strain any man’s vitality. Wherever homosexuality has been given an honorable place in any society, those to whom it is congenial have filled adequately the honorable role society assigns them”(Benedict 1934). In other cultures, such as certain tribes of North American Indians, as well as other indigenous peoples, and especially during the classic period of Greece, where Platonic love was accepted without prejudice, gay people have adjusted fully into the culture, rising to positions of prominence and even taking roles of leadership, as they have been able to again in recent years with the lessening of societal pressures against them. Discussing the “Aftermath and Parallels” of the suppression of the Qedeshim, the Editors of The Encyclopedia of Homosexuality (Dynes, Percy, Johansson, and Donaldson, 1990) wrote that “The taboo on homosexuality in Western civilization is thus a legacy of the religious rivalries and conflicts in Ancient Israel, and of the formation of the Jewish community after the Babylonian captivity as a client-ethnos of the Persian monarchy.” In the original Hebrew, kadesh [qedesh], literally “holy one,” is the word which in translation was writ as “sodomite” – not exactly a complimentary substitute. In the Christian liturgy the resounding passage, “Holy, holy, holy, is the Lord of hosts: The whole earth is full of his glory” (Isaiah 6:3), is a quite familiar one. In Hebrew the word for Holy is kadosh. This passage is recited solemnly beginning in the words, “Kadosh, kadosh, kadosh” – Holy, holy, holy. It is not difficult to surmise how the word kadesh evolved to describe someone set apart for holy purpose. In later years, the term was used to refer to “devotees of the fertility cult.” Without this historic background, the association of the word kadosh (holy) with kadesh (sodomite) would appear wholly ludicrous.

The “Sin” of homosexuality, came as part and parcel of the suppression of Goddess worship, along with the power of women and the disappearance of ritual cannabis use, and all part of the same religious-based pogrom that led to the cancelation of the temple site at tel Arad. The Biblical fundamentalist, who tries to claim religious morality as a basis for scientific analysis, referring to homosexuality as an “unnatural act,” and evidence of “deviant behavior,” has no logical basis for these claims, making them solely from a theological standpoint. In the natural world, homosexual behavior has been observed in a number of species such as dogs, cats as well as more complex life forms such as apes, and especially dolphins, (the males of which have a slit that other males can penetrate). Recent scientific studies on the brain patterns of homosexuals, have shown that their minds often operate in a gender specific way that is opposite to that of their bodies. Such research has been seen as indicative that some people are “naturally” pre-inclined for homosexual behavior. This is an important difference in regards to the acceptance of these traits, between the polytheistic and matriarchal cultures that proceeded the patriarchal monotheism depicted in the Hebrew Bible These findings are evidence for a widespread cult of Asherah and connect her worship, specifically to a woman’s cult. Evidence for the existence of this cult can also be found in the Jewish Bible, though it is primarily through negative polemic. The symbol for the Goddess Asherah often found at these sites was a wooden pole or a tree that represented the “tree of life.” This “tree of life” originated in the ancient Near East sometime in the 3rd millennium BCE. By the 13th century BCE, it had become the symbol of the goddess in ancient Israel. We can surmise that the asherah was more than a Canaanite import based upon analysis of the inscriptions and the biblical evidence. The asherah appears to have been an accepted religious cultic symbol in ancient Israel during the pre-exilic period.

Biblical texts indicate that as time progressed, the asherah cult became partially or fully integrated into the worship of YHWH. Deuteronomic history rarely criticizes the goddess; it focuses its attention on the cultic symbol of the asherah. Biblical texts indicate that asherah worship continued during the period of Judges (1200-1000) and lasted to a few decades before the fall of the southern kingdom of Judah (587/586) (Tronetti, 2020). Some see evidence for the worship of Asherah as dating as far back as 5,500 BCE, which would make Asherah’s worship long pre date that of the Bible’s first texts, or even the concept of Yahweh. A Haaretz article “7,500-year-old Burial in Eilat Contains Earliest Asherah” suggests that a “Juniper tree trunk in a grave in Eilat” is “the earliest ‘Asherah’ discovered so far in the Near East … dated by radiocarbon analysis to 4540 B.C.E. It is the oldest ‘Ashera’ found anywhere” (Greenboim Rich, 2022). In light of this ancient date, it is worth noting that Sula Benet, the woman who first identified kaneh bosm as cannabis, connected the ritual use of cannabis worship to the Goddess cults that preceded the rise of Yahweh and Patriarchal monotheism. “Taking into account the matriarchal element of Semitic culture, one is led to believe that Asia Minor was the original point of expansion for both the society based on the matriarchal circle and the mass use of hashish” (Benet, 1936). The Matriarchal theory holds that as humanity made the transition from a nomadic hunter-gatherer, into a pastoral agriculturist, much of the earlier focus on animal totems (humanity’s oldest religious symbols which were used to symbolically attract game), later became focused on the image of the Great Goddess, Mother Earth and the proper worship of her so that the earth would bear its fruits. As the developing mind of humanity struggled to comprehend the patterns of order in the seemingly chaotic world around them, they perceived that all new life was given birth by the feminine. “In the presence of birth, they were doubtful not merely about the father’s identity but about his existence. Sex relations occurred without pregnancy; why should not pregnancy occur without sex relations? Woman alone was the visible life bestower” (Ashe 1976). In paleolithic times it was natural for a woman to be pregnant, and there was no particular reason to wonder how it came about…. Man’s role in procreation was not one that could be easily deduced from the pattern of everyday paleolithic life, when intercourse was frequent and pregnancy commonplace, when the only calendar was the moon, and", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634243995_cleaned.txt:32:817e8fddd487", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 1982, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634243995_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634243995", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634243995_cleaned", "chunk_index": 33, "text": "Sex relations occurred without pregnancy; why should not pregnancy occur without sex relations?

Man’s role in procreation was not one that could be easily deduced from the pattern of everyday paleolithic life, when intercourse was frequent and pregnancy commonplace, when the only calendar was the moon, and nine months in relation to life expectancy almost as long as two years today…. there is nothing in all the long millennia of the paleolithic era to prove that … [man] knew about … [his role in procreation] (Tannahill 1982). In the early situation of human culture, the group psyche was dominant. A relation of participation mystique prevailed between the individual and his group and its environment, particularly the world of plants and animals.… For many good reasons, the basic matriarchal view saw no relation between the sexual act and the bearing of children. Pregnancy and sexuality were disassociated both in the inner and outward experience of woman. This may be readily understood when we consider that these early societies were characterized by a promiscuous sex life that began far before sexual maturity…In the primordial phase therefore, the woman always conceived by an extrahuman, transpersonal power… (Neumann 1955\\1974). This primeval concept of the female as the sole creatrix of life gave rise to the cult of the Great Mother and thus many of the most ancient surviving religious artifacts are images of the female form. Her millennia of worship and veneration lasted well into Biblical times. “Evidence that worship of divinity in its feminine aspect had a place of importance in Canaan and Syria is given by the numerous small female statuettes with sexual characteristics emphasized which have been found by archaeologists … it is clear that the worship of the goddess fits in well with the Canaanite fertility cult, and the number of these figurines attest to the high measure of popularity which she enjoyed” (Ringgren 1973). This is the cultural environment within which the origins of the Bible were rooted. The Patriarchal monotheism of the Bible was virtually unknown. In the majority of hunter-gatherer societies Women generally balanced the males, supply of game with their collected harvest from the surrounding wilderness. It is believed that women, who acted as the gatherers in the early nomadic clan, were the first to recognize how the plants they collected propagated themselves, and this led to the development of agriculture. “Since the cultivation of plants was first undertaken by women, their importance in the social structure greatly increased, which, in turn, gave rise to a cult of Mother Earth, as well as to a mythology of the moon conceived as female” (Patai 1967). Agriculture, and an abundant harvest, led to more settled", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634243995_cleaned.txt:33:b2963cfa409d", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 1983, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634243995_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634243995", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634243995_cleaned", "chunk_index": 34, "text": "as the gatherers in the early nomadic clan, were the first to recognize how the plants they collected propagated themselves, and this led to the development of agriculture. “Since the cultivation of plants was first undertaken by women, their importance in the social structure greatly increased, which, in turn, gave rise to a cult of Mother Earth, as well as to a mythology of the moon conceived as female” (Patai 1967). Agriculture, and an abundant harvest, led to more settled communities, and in light of this, it is not at all surprising to find that most of the earliest civilizations were both matriarchally structured and agriculturally based, i.e., Mohenjo-Daro, where evidence of ancient cannabis cloth has been recovered dating back to 9,000 BCE These early agriculturally based communities had a relationship and knowledge of the natural world around them that was likely comparable to that of the few un-Christianized aboriginal communities that have managed to survive down to our modern day – groups that have such an intense knowledge of the properties of the plants around them that it astounds many an academically trained botanist and chemist. As Anthropologist Richard Rudgley has commented on the early matriarchal situation; While animal proteins are highly prized, the bulk of the staples are usually the result of female labor. This division of labor may suggest that in prehistoric times women’s role vis-a-vis plants were not limited to the culinary or even medical spheres, but extended into the discovery of psychoactive plants (this has a distant echo in the female dominated European witchcraft tradition…). Gatherers have an extremely detailed knowledge of their land and its natural resources, and having considered the technical and intellectual achievements of hunter-gatherer communities past and present we should not be surprised that they were able to identify, collect and process a variety of species… (Rudgley 1993). As goddess of the food-giving plants, herbs, and fruits, she numinously transforms these basic elements into intoxications and poisons. It is quite evident that the preparation and storage of food taught woman the process of fermentation and the manufacture of intoxicants, and that, as a gatherer and later preparer of herbs, plants, and fruits, she was the inventor and guardian of the first healing potions, medicines, and poisons…. The goddess is therefore not only the queen of the ennobled fruit of the soil but also of the spirit matter of transformation that is embodied in … wine [and other intoxicants]… With her primordial association with the magical poppy, it is not so surprising to find the Goddess connected with other sacred plants as well. As noted the development of agriculture first took place during what is known as the matriarchal period of human culture when the image of the mother Goddess was the most widespread and common motif. Carl Sagan has suggested that cannabis was humanity’s first agricultural crop (1977).

Carl Sagan has suggested that cannabis was humanity’s first agricultural crop (1977). Likewise the entheogen and aphrodisiac researcher Christian Rätsch has noted; “No other plant has been with humans as long as hemp. It is most certainly one of humanity’s oldest cultural objects” (Rätsch 1997). With the views of such eminent scholars in mind along with the historically known popularity of the goddess at this same time, it only seems conclusive that there had to have been a deep rooted relationship between the ancient hemp crop and the Great Mother worshiped by the people who originally planted it. A hypothesis which is strengthened immensely with a look through the historical record. Let us look at the factors which could have contributed to the start of mass use of hashish in the matriarchal circle. One important factor is that in preparing fiber from plants and during the harvest the strong odor intoxicates the workers. According to ancient customs still surviving in modern times, all work involving hemp is done in mass. Since antiquity the hemp harvest has been considered a holiday, especially for the young people. In many countries the harvest is a sort of reunion to which guests come with or without masks and give all sorts of presents to the workers. Here we see an obvious link with the masculine secret societies in the matriarchal circle in which there is mass use of hashish (Benet/Benetowa, 1936). Benet takes us back to a time period from which one of the most prevailing artifacts recovered has been various artifacts relating to the worship of the Great Goddess. A theory postulated by some anthropologists, that is fostered by these artifacts, suggests that in Palaeolithic, Mesolithic eras and/or Neolithic Europe and Western Asia and North Africa, a singular, monotheistic female deity was worshiped prior to the development of the polytheistic pagan religions of the Bronze Age and Iron Age. Asherah’s origins are believed to have developed out of early incarnations of the Goddess and her cult. Considering the length of time here, it’s not surprising to find that the various regional offshoots of the Goddess took on a variety of new names and mythologies. However there are still commonalities that help to identify their shared origins. Prior to the rise of the Israelites and their God in the region, it is believed that Asherah was worshiped as Athirat, by the Canaanites who inhabited the region prior to the Israelite dominance of the area. One of Athirat’s titles was", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634243995_cleaned.txt:35:0c74908d2297", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 1985, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634243995_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634243995", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634243995_cleaned", "chunk_index": 36, "text": "length of time here, it’s not surprising to find that the various regional offshoots of the Goddess took on a variety of new names and mythologies.

Prior to the rise of the Israelites and their God in the region, it is believed that Asherah was worshiped as Athirat, by the Canaanites who inhabited the region prior to the Israelite dominance of the area. One of Athirat’s titles was “Elat” meaning “the Goddess,” the feminine form of “El” (God). William Dever refers to a Canaanite clay jar shard that reads “A lamb, a gift for my lady, Elat” as Dever notes “Elat, is the feminine form of El, so you have the male and the female deity El and Elat … there are two name in the Hebrew Bible for God, one is Yahweh, [translated as “Lord”] the National Hebrew deity, the other name is El, the name of the old Canaanite high God and it appears not only in this singular, but in the plural ‘the gods’” [i.e. Elohim] (Dever, 2013). Here Dever sees more evidence of the Goddess and the earlier cosmology hidden by the final authors and editors of the Hebrew Bible texts. As Caroline Tully, who holds a PhD. in archeology and has written about cult objects associated with Asherah, has noted “We know that in mythology Athirat interceded with El on behalf of petitioners, both gods and humans. Asherah may have interceded in the same way with Yahweh when he took over from El as chief god of the Israelites”: “Athirat” … was a queen mother and consort to El, the chief god of Ugarit. Athirat also appeared in other cultures such as Mesopotamia and South Arabia where she was similarly associated with the chief male deity. In Ugaritic myth Athirat was … considered to be the mother of both gods and kings, and her function as the queen mother was to assign gods and mortals their roles in life. Athirat was also renowned as a successful intercessor with El – often only she could persuade El about something when everyone else had failed. Both gods and humans sought the ear of El through her. Athirat may also have been a deity petitioned particularly by women: she is described as holding a spindle, the typical tool of the housewife and her name may even be related to the Ugaritic word for woman, “att” … Most scholars agree that Canaanite Athirat is equivalent to the biblical Asherah (Tully, 2011). In relation to Athirat’s spindles, its worth noting that “in the temple of the Lord … women did weaving for Asherah” (2 Kings 23:7). Both forms of the Goddess also seem to have held a role in funerary cults, and in respect to weaving and funerary cults, and in respect to the findings of Arad, there", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634243995_cleaned.txt:36:b0fdcea28bbe", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 1986, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634243995_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634243995", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634243995_cleaned", "chunk_index": 37, "text": "be related to the Ugaritic word for woman, “att” … Most scholars agree that Canaanite Athirat is equivalent to the biblical Asherah (Tully, 2011).

Both forms of the Goddess also seem to have held a role in funerary cults, and in respect to weaving and funerary cults, and in respect to the findings of Arad, there have been claims that it was at one time a religious requirement in Mishnic times that the dead be buried in hemp shirts. In her article “Asherah and Textiles” Jeannette H. Boertien noted “In Ugaritic texts Asherah … is described … with a spindle in her hand, dropping the spindle from her hand ( [= spinning).” Boertien refers to two archaeological sites that indicate the weaving of ritual garments and cloths, that may be associated with Asherah or one of her regional counterparts, where hemp cloth was found in this context: Fragments of textile were also found. Most were carbonized threads retrieved from the holes of some loom weights. In a room directly south of the benched room a small fragment of fabric, measuring 52 x 32 m m , was still lying in situ between 38 loom weights. These finds were analyzed by Dr. W.D. Cook of the Manchester Department of Textiles using a Scanning Electron Microscope.… The fabric turned out to be a very fine hemp cloth, a textile rarely encountered in the Middle East.… Deir ‘Alla is the only known site in the Levant where hemp fiber has been identified in an archaeological context. The find of a fragment of finely woven hemp cloth … is very exceptional, as hemp cloth has never before been reported from Iron Age levels in the Levant. Beside wool, linen is the most commonly used plant fiber. The presence of cloth made of the fiber hemp in the same complex in which a cult room with a religious inscription is found raises the question whether this special kind of cloth could have had a cultic use (Boertien 2007). This aspect of weaving and spindles, seems to have been somewhat of a common factor with Goddesses associated with Asherah, who are believed to have come from a shared older origin, but took on their own regional names and myths over time. Professor of Northwest Semitic Languages at Yale University, Marvin Pope referred to an ancient hymn to Ishtar in this context: “The expert singers sit before her on the ground, those who play the lyre, the harp and the clappers … the kurgarrus the spindle … and the whip, ease her mind with (incense of) ‘sweet reeds’.” Pope compares these “sweet reeds” to references to the Bible that “The ‘sweet reed’ … with which the goddess’ inwards are soothed, is presumably the", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634243995_cleaned.txt:37:834282381ccf", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 1987, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634243995_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634243995", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634243995_cleaned", "chunk_index": 38, "text": "of Northwest Semitic Languages at Yale University, Marvin Pope referred to an ancient hymn to Ishtar in this context: “The expert singers sit before her on the ground, those who play the lyre, the harp and the clappers … the kurgarrus the spindle … and the whip, ease her mind with (incense of) ‘sweet reeds’.” Pope compares these “sweet reeds” to references to the Bible that “The ‘sweet reed’ … with which the goddess’ inwards are soothed, is presumably the same ‘aromatic cane’ of Exodus 30:23 and the ‘sweet cane’ of Jer 6:20; Isa 43:24; Ezek 27:19 and simply ‘cane’ in Canticles 4 : 14^(′′) (Pope 1977). Interestingly, these same references to “cane” are the references that we will be looking at in the next chapters, as Sula Benet identified them in 1936 as references to cannabis. In the case of Ishtar, the use of cannabis seems likely as this is indicated in ancient Assyrian inscriptions as well. More interestingly, as we shall see, is that Ishtar is directly connected to cannabis in Assyrian and Babylonian texts. Assyriologist Erica Reiner reveals a connection between the goddesses Ishara and Ishtar and cannabis that is not mentioned in more than a couple of books on the ancient Near East in reference to the: “herb called Sim.Ishara ‘aromatic of the Goddess Ishtar,’ which is equated with the Akkadian qunnabu, ‘cannabis’, [which] may indeed conjure up an aphrodisiac through the association with Ishara, goddess of love, and also calls to mind the plant called ki.na Ishtar” (Reiner, 1995). This is also the view of Barbara Böck, of the Institute of Languages and Cultures of the Mediterranean and Near East, who stated that “A small cuneiform tablet which states ‘qunnubu is the aromatic plant of the goddess Ishkhara’ [sic-Isharra] is notable because it has been interpreted that Cannabis sativa might have been used as an aphrodisiac” (Böck, 2022). It should be noted that throughout the centuries in literature referring to cannabis, including medical journals, the aphrodisiac potential of the plant is acknowledged (Mikuriya, M.D. 1973, Grinspoon, M.D., & Bakalar 1993). In The Encyclopedia of Erotic Wisdom, which contains a number of entries regarding different preparations and utilizations of hemp, Rufus C. Camphausen notes that, “It is well known among the users of hashish and marijuana that THC, the main active ingredient of cannabis, is – among other things – a strong aphrodisiac, a fact even recognized by the Encyclopedia Britannica” (Camphausen 1991). In fact, so renowned is cannabis for its aphrodisiacal properties, that in his extensive book on aphrodisiacs, Plants of Love, Christian Rätsch writes “No matter which culture, no matter what time: hemp has been repeatedly deemed the aphrodisiac” (Rätsch 1997). A 2002 edition of the Compte Rendu, Rencontre Assyriologique Internationale, a journal from the Rencontre Assyriologique Internationale (RAI) [which is the annual Assyriological Conference], (Parpola & Whiting ed. 2002) has a paper on", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634243995_cleaned.txt:38:084d875e3118", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 1988, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634243995_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634243995", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634243995_cleaned", "chunk_index": 39, "text": "recognized by the Encyclopedia Britannica” (Camphausen 1991).

ŠIM Iš - ha - ra qu - nu - bu - ‘The herb of Ishara ( is ).” The paper also noted the use of cannabis in ritual aromatic oils and delivery of large quantities of cannabis to Eanna, the temple of Inanna, the ancient Sumerian goddess of love, sensuality, fertility, procreation, and also of war. Inanna later became identified by the Akkadians and Assyrians as the goddess Ishtar, and further with the Hittite Sauska, the Phoenician Astarte and the Greek Aphrodite, among many others. As Fales explains “the connection between the salve of the plant qunubu and the name of this goddess might be sought in the aspect of the latter as deity of love. On qunubu … as cannabis … another [Assyrian] attestation of the plant [is translated]… (She) said: ‘what is required for the ritual?’ Quality oil, wax, quality salves (and particularly) salve of myrrh and salve of cannabis…” (Fales, 1983). …The multifaceted goddess Ishara. She does not appear to be a native Mesopotamian deity, but was worshiped by many people throughout the ancient Near East, which has led to a confusing array of attributions – she is known as a great goddess to the Hurrians, the wife of Dagon among the West Semites, and to the Akkadians she was a goddess of love with close affinities to Ishtar, whose sacred plant cannabis (qunnabu) was known as the aromatic of Ishara … from her widespread worship she is also known as the queen of the inhabited world (White, 2008). Ishara may represent a possible origin point for the use of cannabis in these ancient Goddess cults. It has been suggested that her name may come from an Indo-European root that means “rope” or “bind” likely in references to her role in oath keeping agreements, a role she shares with the Semitic Asherah. She was worshiped by the Hittites and they had the oldest attested Indo-European language. “Ishara” is affirmed as a loanword in the 19th century BC Assyrian Kültepe texts, and as such this would be among the earliest evidence of a written word of any Indo-European language. Variations of “Ishara” appear as “Ašḫara” (in a treaty of Naram-Suen of Akkad with Hita of Elam) and “Ušḫara” (in Ugarite texts).

Variations of “Ishara” appear as “Ašḫara” (in a treaty of Naram-Suen of Akkad with Hita of Elam) and “Ušḫara” (in Ugarite texts). In the archaeological site at Alalah, her name appeared with the Akkadogram IŠTAR plus a phonetic complement “-ra,” as IŠTAR-“ra.” All phonetically similar to Asherah and Ishtar. The connection to Ishtar here is interesting, as this Goddess’ cult, like that of Asherah’s was known for its shamanic priestesses. As the British Archaeologist Diana Stein has noted “Inspired prophecy is a Mesopotamian phenomenon that is linked, in particular, to the ecstatic cult of Ishtar. The cult of Ishtar is described as an esoteric mystery cult that promises transcendental salvation and eternal life to its initiates. Altered states of consciousness, visions, and inspired prophecies were achieved by means of various ecstatic techniques…” (Stein, 2009). We can see here that cannabis and likely other entheogenic substances were a part of this technique. Volkert Haas, a German Assyrologist and Hittitologist stated in Geschichte der hethitischen Religion (1994) that: “the nature of Išḫara is closely related with that of the goddess Ištar [sic-Ishtar]. At the end of the 2nd millennium BC Išḫara is hard to distinguish from Ištar anymore. For instance in a cuneiform lexical list ‘the star of Išḫara’ is similar with ‘Ištar, the mistress of the Lands.’ In the beginning of the 1st mil. her aspect as goddess of sexuality is completed with goddess of war. Then epithets like ‘Išḫara, Mistress of Mankind’ show that henceforth she is melded with Ištar.” Considering the Indo-European (IE) ritual use of cannabis in funerary rites is indicated as far back as 3,500 BCE in Romania and the Ukraine regions, and is known to have spread throughout the ancient world with IE culture in the Mid-East, China and India, combined with the known goddess worship of cannabis using IE groups like the Scythians, Ishara worship by Indo-European speaking Hittites, does seem a likely ancient avenue of ritual cannabis use into the region. However, this Indo-European etymology of the name Ishara has been called into question, since the goddess appears from as early as the mid-3rd millennium as one of the chief goddesses of Ebla. Although her worship by the IE language Hittites assures that cannabis could still have been adopted by her cult.

Before the Syrian civil war, archaeologists digging in Ebla collected samples from a site that was described as a “kitchen,” although there were no indications of the plant and animal remains that would usually be associated with food preparation. However as noted in the April 20th, 2018, issue of Science, in the story, “Cannabis, opium use part of ancient Near Eastern cultures”: The researchers found traces of wild plants often used for medicine, such as poppy for opium to dull pain, heliotrope to fight viral infections, and chamomile to reduce inflammation. Given that the space contained eight hearths and pots that could hold 40 to 70 liters, the drugs could have been made in large quantities…. Some of these extracts, such as opium, can induce hallucinations, although it’s unclear whether the potions were used in ritual or medicine. The kitchen’s location near the heart of the palace suggests its products were used for ceremonial occasions, and cuneiform tablets from the building mention special priests associated with ritual beverages.… The distinction between medicine and mind-altering drug may have been lost on ancient peoples (Lawler, 1918). Cannabis coming in via IE trade routes to the Hittites, would likely only have been added to the domain of an already existing Goddess who was associated with sacred plants. Thus regardless of her origins, Ishara still seems like an early possible avenue for the ritual use of cannabis to have been introduced in the Near East, as well as account for the plant’s association with other Near Eastern Goddesses, such as Asherah and Ishtar, both of whose origins are likely tied back with the earlier Ishara. However, many sources see an older relationship between Ishtar and Inanna, another goddess that holds ties with cannabis. Like Ishtar, who she is conflated with, Inanna was an ancient Mesopotamian goddess of love, war, and fertility. She is also associated with beauty, sex, divine justice, and political power. As with other similar near Eastern Goddesses, Inanna also seems to have had strong ties with the ritual use of cannabis. Inanna had a famous cultic temple in Eanna, and as noted “later Neo-Babylonian text records the delivery of large quantities of qunnabu [cannabis] to the great temple of Eanna” (Stein, 2009). Cannabis also “appears as one of two ingredients in a sacrifice for another goddess, namely Tašmetu, divine spouse of the god Nabu” (Böck, 2022).

Cannabis also “appears as one of two ingredients in a sacrifice for another goddess, namely Tašmetu, divine spouse of the god Nabu” (Böck, 2022). Tašmetu’s main position was that of wife to Nabu, divine scribe of destinies. Nabu functions as a god of wisdom, because knowledge and learning were often transmitted via writing and thus by association, Tašmetu also became bound with wisdom, and is deemed a wise goddess in a fragmentary prayer (CTN 4, 166). Like Ishara, Ishtar and Asherah, Tašmetu has a link with sexual attractiveness, which may stem from a shared aspect with the goddess Nanaya, a Mesopotamian goddess of love, who is closely associated with Inanna. In first-millennium Assyria, Tašmetu was Nabu’s consort but in Babylonia this role was taken by the goddess Nanaya (Inanna/Ištar). “Tašmetu is mentioned in association with both sexual attractiveness and wisdom in first-millennium prayers. In another prayer (CTN 4, 168) she is described as the ‘queen and lady of the fates’ (obv. ii 53). The same prayer also describes Tašmetu as a ‘goddess of sex appeal and sensuality’ (rrev. i 25) and ‘mistress of the lovers in the inhabited world’ (rev. ii 19). Tašmetu’s associations with both sex and wisdom may stem from a shared aspect with Nabu’s other consort Nanaya/ Ištar” (Horry, 2013). The name of the Babylonian goddess Beltu (var. Belit, Belti) is the feminine form of Bel (“Lord”) and means “Lady.” She is identified either with Ishtar or Ṣarpanitu [Wife of Marduk, and a goddess of childbirth]. Her mention in the Hebrew Bible is conjectural … biltî in Isa. 10.4 into bēltî, “my Lady.” … Since the name Beltu is not really a name but an epithet (“Lady”), the identification with a specific deity is beset with problems. Used in genetical constructions such as Belet-Akkadi or Belet-ekaliim, the term “Lady” is an element in the name (or epithet) of numerous Babylonian and Assyrian … goddesses.… The goddess to have been designated most frequently by this epithet, both in Sumerian … and Akkadian … is no doubt Ishtar. This is notable in relation to references to Ishtar in 18th century BCE tablets from the Palace of Mari, which was located in modern day Syria. These texts refer to a ritual dedicated to the Ishtar and refer to a drink given to ecstatic seers, who spoke on behalf of the Goddess.“Presumably this drink contained psychoactive substances, perhaps mixed with wine, as Mari was a key center in the wine trade” (Stein, et. al., 2022).

(This passage is also interesting in relation to references in Jeremiah 44, that shall be discussed in a later chapter, which condemn both the burning of incense to the “Queen of Heaven” as well as “pouring out drink offerings” to her.) Asherah shares many traits with these other near Eastern God- desses, and many scholars believe this is due to a much more ancient common origin. In light of the findings in Arad, it is interesting that Asherah has similarly been connected to cannabis. The first time I read about this was in a chapter on cannabis by the Botanist William Emboden which stated that “There is a classic Greek term, cannabeizen, which means to smoke Cannabis. Cannabeizen frequently took the form of inhaling vapors from an incense burner in which these resins were mixed with other resins, such as myrrh, balsam, frankincense, and perfumes; this is the manner of the shamanistic Ashera priestesses of pre-reformation Jerusalem, who anointed their skins with the mixture as well as burned it” (Emboden 1972). Taking cannabis is indeed an ancient enough practice; cannabeizein, “to smoke pot,” appears in the ordinary Classical Greek dictionary. Presumably its fumes were absorbed through the pores of the skin when the cannabis itself was smoked over a low fire – the pot taker crouching over it clad only in a poncho. This at least seems to have been how the Ashera priestesses of the pre-Reformation Temple at Jerusalem impregnated their skins with the holy incense, which was mixed with other perfumes (Graves, 1970). Unfortunately, Graves gave no indication for the origins of this claim and I cannot find anything regarding this, beyond his statement. However, what is interesting is that Graves had a very close relationship with Rapahel Patai, author of The Hebrew Goddess (1967) who was discussed earlier. In fact in the early 1960s the two wrote a book together, The Hebrew Myths (1964). I can find nothing indicating Patai ever wrote about such a connection, but interestingly enough, he does seem to be acquainted with the anthropologist and etymologist discussed in the next chapter, Sula Benet. Benet theorized that the Hebrew term kaneh bosem, was actually a reference to cannabis. This new archeology from tel Arad, vindicates her claim, and takes it from being a ‘theory’ into the realm of historical fact. Moreover what these references to cannabis tell, is the story of a plant, once burnt in the Holy of Holies in Jerusalem, that fell out of favor due to", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634243995_cleaned.txt:43:337c658a5ff8", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 1993, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634243995_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634243995", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634243995_cleaned", "chunk_index": 44, "text": "to be acquainted with the anthropologist and etymologist discussed in the next chapter, Sula Benet.

Moreover what these references to cannabis tell, is the story of a plant, once burnt in the Holy of Holies in Jerusalem, that fell out of favor due to its association with the cult of Asherah, the Queen of Heaven, and one time wife of the Biblical God! …we know that even after the Jewish occupation some signs of Canaanite divinities remained here and there, in particular of Asherah, who together with Anat and Astarte, were the Canaanite ideas of fertility. The Old Testament mentions superstitious practices, referring to the aforementioned Canaanite goddess, practices that were opposed by the civil and religious authorities. It can be understood how the priests of pagan gods, who according to St. Paul are demons 1 Cor 10 : 20) , needed certain practices to stimulate concentration in order to get in touch with occult forces.… But this mentality and similar rituals are despised by Holy Scripture (Bellon, 2021).2 Biblical scholars, on their own, are unlikely to explore such “outsiders’” claims, like those who find references to cannabis in the Bible, do. Clearly cannabis was known in the ancient world and people then didn’t have our modern filters of “the war on drugs,” or, as Bennett makes clear, prohibition, to tell them drugs were bad. In fact, traditional cultures around the world believed natural hallucinogens were sacred, or at least gateways to sacred experiences. Bennett presents an overarching revisionist view of the Hebrew Bible (including the Apocrypha). There are many parts where my scholarly spidey-sense was tingling – one of the first things you learn in the academy is that connections have to be tested and retested and run by other scholars for their approval before they can be deemed valid – but overall it’s clear a lot of research went into this. The academic heart that still beats in this weary chest says, “but wait, too many connections are made and it all fits into too tidy a package.” … And yes, Asherah is part of this tidy package too. There are some very interesting ideas here. While scholars argue about J, E, D, and P and their possible non-existence, others have already moved on to some interesting conclusions based on a fiery cup*3 and its contents. I was ousted from the academy for being too liberal in a conservative environment. I have watched how the academy behaves for at least thirty years now.

(Wiggens, 2021) So if the ancient Israelites were joining in on the party, why doesn’t the Bible mention the use of cannabis as a substance used in rituals, just as it does numerous times for frankincense? …One possibility is that cannabis does appear in the text but the name used for the plant is not recognized by researchers, Arie says, adding that hopefully the new study will open up that question for biblical scholars. A question is also raised as to whether this was religiously condoned use or heresy? Some researchers have suggested the evidence of tel Arad indicates the practices of the Holy of Holies at the main temple, other sources see this as proof of the sort of pagan activities taking place at the “high places” which were condemned in the Hebrew Bible narrative, particularly in regards to the cult of Asherah. Another question is raised in that the original research paper on the Arad altars noted that there is little evidence that the frankincense and cannabis resins burnt on the altars at Arad were even produced in the Holy Land, and suggest they were imported into the region. If that is the case, where would they have come from? Tel Arad was of particular interest to me, as for more than three decades, I have been suggesting that there are indications of the ritual use of cannabis in the Biblical narrative. However, this theory was based purely on etymological evidence regarding Hebrew terms, kaneh and kaneh bosm, that a little known Polish Anthropologist and linguist, Sula Benet, first suggested in a 1936 paper, were references to cannabis. What is most interesting, is how closely what we know about the finds of cannabis resins at the shrine in Arad, parallels the story told by the kaneh and kaneh bosm references identified by Sula Benet. Both in the original Hebrew text of the Old Testament and in the Aramaic translation, the word kaneh or keneh is used either alone or linked to the adjective bosm in Hebrew and busma in Aramaic, meaning aromatic. It is cana in Sanskrit, qunnabu in Assyrian, kenab in Persian, kannab in Arabic and kanbun in Chaldean. In Exodus 30: 23, God directed Moses to make a holy oil composed of “myrrh, sweet cinnamon, kaneh bosm and kassia.” In many ancient languages, including Hebrew, the root kan has a double meaning – both hemp and reed.

In many translations of the Bible’s original Hebrew, we find kaneh bosm variously and erroneously translated as “calamus” and “aromatic reed,” a vague term. Calamus, [Calamus aromaticus is a fragrant marsh plant]. The error occurred in the oldest Greek translation of the Hebrew Bible, Septuagint, in the third century B.C., where the terms kaneh, kaneh bosm were incorrectly translated as “calamus.” And in the many translations that followed, including Martin Luther’s, the same error was repeated… In Exodus 30:23 kaneh bosm is translated as “sweet calamus.” In Isaiah 43:24 kaneh is translated as “sweet cane,” although the word “sweet” appears nowhere in the original. In Jeremiah 6:20 kaneh is translated as “sweet cane.” In Ezekiel 27: 19 kaneh is translated as “calamus.” In Song of Songs 4:14 kaneh is translated “calamus.” In the course of time, the two words kaneh and bosm were fused into one, kanabos or kannabus, known to us from Mishnah, the body of traditional Hebrew law. The word bears an unmistakable similarity to the Scythian “cannabis.” Is it too far-fetched to assume that the Semitic word kanbosm and the Scythian word cannabis mean the same thing? (Benet, 1975). There exists a number of historically related words, differing to some degree in the characters employed, but quite clearly derived from the same stem. Sanskrit uses Cana, Hebrew Kaneh and Aramaic Keneh. Persian employs Kenab, Arabic Kannab, Assyrian Qunnabu, Chaldean Kanbun, and Scythian Cannabis. Benet (1975) suggests that, in time, Hebrew and Aramaic linked their root forms with the word meaning ‘aromatic’, namely, bosm and busma, respectively. The result are terms which look much like other Middle East terms, namely kanabos in Hebrew and kannabus in Aramaic (Du Toit, 1996). As Benet has explained, the Hebrew word kaneh-bosm was mistranslated into Greek as calamus at the time the Septuagint was being composed. Calamus is a common marsh plant found throughout much of the Mid East with little monetary worth that does not have the qualities or value ascribed to kaneh-bosm. It should also be noted, the identification of kaneh bosm with calamus, does not discount the use of a psychoactive substance in the Holy anointing oil. Prof. Carl Ruck, a proponent of Benet’s etymological theory, has noted “It is ironic that calamus ‘sweet flag,’ the substitute for the alleged cannabis, is itself a known hallucinogen for which TMA-2 is derived” (Ruck et. al., 2001).

Meyler’s Side Effects of Herbal Medicines also notes this: “Acorus calamus has been used as a hallucinogen since ancient times and it has several uses in folk medicine. It may have been one of the constituents of the Holy Oil that God commanded Moses to make (Exodus 30) and is mentioned by ancient writers on medicine, such as Hippocrates, Theophrastus, Dioscorides, and Celsus” (Aronson, 2008). Although kaneh is described as an item coming in through trade caravans in Ezekiel 27:19, and from a “foreign land” in Jeremiah 6:20, Bible Flowers and Flower Lore (1851) reports that “roots and preparations” from calamus “are still obtained from the East , and principally from the Levant.” This is a longstanding and common view, as noted under “CALAMITIS ( from calamus, a reed )” in Dictionarium Medicum Universale (1749) “This little reed grows in several parts of the Levant, from whence it is brought” (Barrow, 1749). Ancient sources also refer to its production in the countries surrounding Israel, so the idea that the plant would have stopped growing at imagined borders, is preposterous to say the least. Calamus: “An aromatic reed (kalamos euödes; calamus odoratus) was, in fact, to be found in Arabia, according to Theophrastus and Pliny, both of whom knew it to grow in Syria, too; in particular, it grew by the dried-out lake in the Lebanese valley in which sweet rushes (Arabic idhkhir) were also to be found (Theophrastus, Plants, ix, 7: if.; Pliny, Natural History, xn, 104 ff.). It grew in south Arabia, too, according to Agatharchides” (Crone, 2015). Because of this issue and other reasons, alternate sources have suggested the Biblical kaneh was not calamus, but rather “lemon grass” or “ginger grass,” the Andropogon schoenanthus imported from India. However, there is little evidence for this claim, in comparison for the identification of cannabis. As noted in The Perfume Handbook, “the calamus of the ancients … was a different plant from that known as calamus today. It grew, according to the classical authors, in Arabia, the best coming from north Arabia, and Syria as well as in Egypt, and was probably the plant now known as Lemon Grass” (Groom, 2013). The Encyclopedia Judaica (2007) viewed kaneh bosm as a reference to both Lemon grass (Cymbopogon), and Schoenus, a predominately austral genus of sedges, commonly known as bogrushes, or veldrushes, adding to the candidates, based on the reference to calamus in the writings of Theophrastus (371-237 BCE).

Apparently both grew locally, which would discount them as an item of trade: “An interesting problem is posed by the statement of Theophrastus about calamus and schoenus, apparently two species of keneh-bosem – (Cymbopogon) growing in a valley not far from the Lebanon, probably the Ḥuleh area. The English naturalist H.B. Tristram, who explored Ereẓ Israel in the second half of the 19th century, wrote that the second species grew then in the vicinity of Lake Kinneret” (Skolnik, 2007). Admitting that it is hopeless to speculate about which of the possible species (Cymbopogon citratus, Cymbopogon martinii, or Cymbopogon schoenanthus) [Lemon Grass] was intended by the biblical writers, Zohary [Michael Zohary, a pioneering Israeli botanist] led his discussion with ginger grass.… In my first Bible book, I followed Moldenke’s [an American botanist/taxonomist] suggestion it could be Andropogon schoenanthus [Camel Grass] or Andropogon muricatus (which is apparently Vetiveria) and they leaned towards the vetiver. After reading Zohary, I am more inclined to side with him. No one seems to push Acorus calamus.… It seems less likely to have been imported than the Cymbopogon or Vetiveria, to either of which the alternate translation of “sweet [smelling] cane” seems more appropriate (Duke, 2007). Aryeh Kaplan in The Living Torah, quotes four opinions as to the identity of keneh bosem: calamus (Septuagint, Rambam Peirush HaMishnayos, et. al.), Cympopogan (Rambam Mishneh Torah), Cannabis (“some”), and Cinnamon (Radak, Abarbanel): “Fragrant cane Keneh bosem in Hebrew. Ancient sources identify this with the sweet calamus (Septuagint; Rambam on Kerithoth 1:1; Saadia; Ibn Janach). This is the sweetflag or flag-root, Acoras calamus which grows in Europe. It appears that a similar species grew in the Holy Land, in the Hula region in ancient times (Theophrastus, History of Plants 9:7). Other sources apparently indicate that it was the Indian plant, Cympopogan martini, which has the form of red straw (Yad, Kley HaMikdash 1:3). On the basis of cognate pronunciation and Septuagint readings, some identify Keneh bosem with the English and Greek cannabis, the hemp plant. There are, however, some authorities who identify the ‘sweet cane’ with cinnamon bark (Radak, Sherashim). Some say that kinman is the wood, and keneh bosem is the bark (Abarbanel)” (Kaplan, 1981).

Dr. J. Alan Branch, a Professor of Christian Ethics at Midwestern Baptist Theological Seminary, recently wrote an article rejecting Sula Benet’s hypothesis, and made a rather novel generalization about the term kaneh bosm. “Benet’s bizarre assertion is not substantiated by the definitive Hebrew lexicon, The Hebrew and Aramaic Lexicon of the Old Testament, which says the term qanēh-bōśem [kaneh bosm] is referring to a type of balsam oil. Balsam simply refers to aromatic resins derived from certain plants, and not cannabis (Branch, 2022).1 As the recipe given in Exodus 30:23 is elsewhere quite specific on both measurements and ingredients, and includes already a distinct variety of aromatic plants to be prepared in Olive oil, this suggestion seems particularly doubtful, and is not found among the Hebrew sources we have cited here. Although writing his article, in 2022, Professor Branch seems to be sadly unaware of the discovery of cannabis resins on an altar in tel Arad, two years prior.2 What this shows, is the lack of an actual firm identification, of the Biblical kaneh. Candidates include calamus, schoenus, bark of cinnamon, vetiver, ginger grass, camel grass, lemon grass, and cannabis. However, the evidence sits much more firmly with cannabis than any of these other candidates as we shall see, and the evidence for this goes far beyond the similarity in the cognate pronunciation noted by Kaplan. Greek as “parthenos – “virgin.” This single example had a monumental effect on later Christian cosmology and theology as it resulted in the later belief that the Messiah must be born of a virgin. Moreover, in relation to our study, the mistranslation of Hebrew botanical names is also believed to have occurred: The fast-growing plant referred to in the biblical Book of Jonah is most often translated into English as “gourd.” However, this is a mistranslation that dates to the appended Septuagint, the Greek translation of the Hebrew Bible, in which the Hebrew word qiqayon (castor, Ricinus communis, Euphorbiaceae) was transformed into the somewhat similar-sounding Greek word kolokynthi (colocynth, Citrullus colocynthis). In translation of the Greek into Latin, kolokynthi became the similar-sounding cucurbita (gourd). This is reflected in early iconography, the plant most often depicted being a long-fruited Lagenaria siceraria (bottle or calabash gourd), a fast-growing climber. ( Janick & Paris, 2006). I would suggest that a further potential direct use of the term kaneh in reference to cannabis occurs in Genesis 41:22, and this passage, which refers to grains, also disallows an interpretation of calamus, as calamus is not known for edible seeds or grains: “In my [ Joseph] dreams I … saw seven heads of grain, full and", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634243995_cleaned.txt:49:46fd91f07aa3", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 1999, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634243995_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634243995", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634243995_cleaned", "chunk_index": 50, "text": "the plant most often depicted being a long-fruited Lagenaria siceraria (bottle or calabash gourd), a fast-growing climber.

Calamus has a single stalk and head. The hemp seed’s use as a food and oil source can be traced back to the very beginnings of civilization and Hebrew references to the use of it for food are known The German botanist, Immanuel Löw, referred to a sixth century BCE Persian name for a preparation of cannabis seed, Sahdanag (Löw, 1925; reprinted 1967). Sahdanag, translated as “Royal Grain”; or “King’s Grain” demonstrates the high regard the ancient Persians held for the nutritious oil rich seeds that came from the same plant which provided them also with a means of religious revelation by means of the drink bangha, which we will discuss in a later chapter. This fits well with the “kaneh” “grain” noted in Joseph’s dream (Genesis 41:22). Sahdanag was generally prepared in the form of a heart shaped cookie, possibly indicating that the ancient Persians recognized the seed’s close relationship with health and vitality (Löw, 1925; reprinted 1967). Sometime after the Persian Empire took control of the ancient world, the Jews adopted this Persian preparation of hemp seed and retained its name of Sahdanag. In Hebraic Literature: Translations from the Talmud, Midrashim and Kabbala, Maurice Henry Harris records that in the Nedarim, fol. 49. col. 1, “Rav Yehudah [(220-299 CE)] says it is good to eat … the essence of hemp seed in Babylonian broth; but it is not lawful to mention this in the presence of an illiterate man, because he might derive a benefit from the knowledge not meant for him” (Harris, et al., 2004). [This “benefit” may have been acquired from brewing seeds with the THC rich calyx covering the seed, being intact when it was prepared.] Immanuel Löw also suggests that the formerly unidentified Hebrew word, tzli’q, (Tzaddi, Lamed, Yod, Quoph), makes reference to a Jewish meal of roasted hemp seeds that was popular into medieval times and was sold by Jews in European markets. (The first part of the name tzli’q simply means roasted, the final letter, Quoph, an abbreviation of kaneh, which begins with that letter – Löw’s reference to this may also indicate independent support for Benet’s interpretation of the term kaneh as cannabis) (Löw, 1925;", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634243995_cleaned.txt:50:7c77036f2522", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 2000, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634243995_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634243995", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634243995_cleaned", "chunk_index": 51, "text": "suggests that the formerly unidentified Hebrew word, tzli’q, (Tzaddi, Lamed, Yod, Quoph), makes reference to a Jewish meal of roasted hemp seeds that was popular into medieval times and was sold by Jews in European markets.

Benet suggested the use of kaneh in reference to cloth as another example “Another piece of evidence regarding the use of the word kaneh in the sense of hemp rather than reed [or calamus] is the religious requirement that the dead be buried in kaneh shirts. Centuries later linen was substituted for hemp (Klein 1908)” (Benet, 1975). Calamus is not a fiber plant. Benet cited Siegfried Klein’s Tod und Begräbnis in Palästina zur Zeit der Tannaiten (H. Itzkowski, 1908), and unfortunately, that reference is less clear on this matter. Although Klein does identify hemp cloth, he does not use the older term kaneh, as Benet claimed, he used the later Mishnah term kanabos, which does indeed identify cannabis, and which Benet saw as a development of the earlier term kaneh bosm. However other sources would argue the kanabos of Mishnah, marks the adoption of the Greek kannabis, during the Hellenistic period. From what I have seen, I think shesh, which will be discussed in the next chapter is a more likely term for hemp cloth during the earlier period, and later in during Mishnic times, this was identified as kanabos. Sula Benet, noted that kanabos, for “cannabis” appears in the Mishnah, the oldest authoritative post biblical collection and codification of Jewish oral laws, systematically compiled over a period of about two centuries and given final form early in the 3rd century CE. Benet asserts that kanabos derived from kaneh bosm. “In the course of time, the two words ‘kaneh’ and ‘bosm’ were fused into one, ‘kanabos’ or ‘kannabus,’ known to us from Mishnah, the body of traditional Hebrew law” (Benet, 1975). Klein’s reference to hemp cloth refers to “the various types of clothing for the dead mentioned by the Talmud,” and identifies a Persian word, sadra, which identifies a “coarse garment.” Klein notes that the 10th century scholar Rashi explains that it is “(probably κάνναβις) [Greek ‘Cannabis’]” (Klein, 1908). Klein here referring to the term used by Rashi qnbws, also translated kanabos, which Klein equated with the Greek kannabis. Similarly, Nahum Ben-Yehuda, in “Cannabis – Chanvre – Hemp in Rashi’s Commentary to the Talmud,” noted that “Rashi mentions hemp in his exegesis to the Talmud and have interpreted them as reflecting contemporary material culture” (Ben-Yehuda, 2011). convincingly discounted as being a counterpart of the earlier Hebrew kaneh bosm, and is instead claimed as the later Hebrew version of", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634243995_cleaned.txt:51:5917bd329b82", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 2001, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634243995_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634243995", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634243995_cleaned", "chunk_index": 52, "text": "1908).

This may have been a valid argument prior to the discovery of cannabis resins at the shrine in tel Arad. However, the case for a Greek origin of the Mishnah kanabos loses ground now that we have direct evidence for cannabis use during the composition period of the Hebrew Bible. To suggest that the Mishnah term kanabos was derived from the Greek kannabis, would now require the discovery of an alternative ancient Hebrew name for cannabis, unrelated to kaneh bosm, that was replaced by the Greek term, to be believable. Such a move would have garnered discussion from the Rabbis. Regardless of the controversy regarding the identification of the origins of the Mishnah term kanabos, with kaneh bosm or Greek kannabis, cannabis was seen as a suitable cloth for ritual attire well into the 16th century. Chapter 9 of the Shulchan Aruch, Code of Jewish Law, records that prayer shawls could be made from wool, silk, flax or hemp. Recently Rabbi Yosef Glassman, summarized “the Talmud does discuss the growing of fields of cannabis, the Shulchan Aruch, Code of Jewish Law, mentions using cannabis for Shabbat wicks, and many sources talk about cannabis as a staple in Jewish clothing, since it doesn’t absorb spiritual impurity … and it … was found to have been used in ancient Israel as an anesthetic, even during childbirth.” As with finds of cannabis resins in ancient Israel, there is also notable archaeological evidence for hemp cloth. Hemp fiber has been found in the Levant at the 800 BCE archaeological site of Deir ’Alla, in a context which implies ritual use, (Boertien 2007). Hemp fiber has also been recovered from the later Talmudic period “Hemp in ancient rope and fabric from the Christmas Cave in Israel: Talmudic background and DNA sequence identification” (Murphy, et. al., 2011). Prior to the discoveries at tel Arad, only limited academic support had emerged for Benet’s theory on the identification of kaneh with cannabis. Notably, in 1980 the respected anthropologist Weston La Barre (1980) referred to the Biblical references in an essay on cannabis, concurring with Benet’s earlier hypothesis. In that same year respected British Journal New Scientist also ran a story that referred to the Hebrew Old Testament references: “Linguistic evidence indicates that in the original Hebrew and Aramaic texts of the Old Testament the ‘holy oil’ which", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634243995_cleaned.txt:52:7e674b4ec076", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 2002, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634243995_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634243995", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634243995_cleaned", "chunk_index": 53, "text": "limited academic support had emerged for Benet’s theory on the identification of kaneh with cannabis.

Further, online, the Internet’s informative Navigating the Bible, used by countless theological students, also refers to the Exodus 30:23 reference as possibly designating cannabis. Noted cannabinoid researcher and historian, Dr. Ethan Russo, has stated: “I firmly believe that kaneh bosm in the Hebrew was cannabis, so I am absolutely convinced it was there … it’s mentioned in Exodus that kaneh bosm was part of the Holy Anointing Oil, also used as an incense and it really makes sense” Making this statement before the discovery of burnt cannabis resins on the altar in Arad, Russo referred to another archaeological find of cannabis residues in the region: “I think it is absolutely clear that cannabis was in the Holy Land, we have archaeological proof dated to the 4th century [AD] there was this carbonized fragment of cannabis that was found in a cave at Bet Shemesh in Israel” (Russo, 2003). Cannabis is called kaneh bosem in Hebrew, which is now recognized as the Scythian word that Herodotus wrote as kannabis (or cannabis). The translators of the bible translate this usually as “fragrant cane,” i.e., an aromatic grass. Once the word is correctly translated, the use of cannabis in the bible is clear. Large amounts of it were compounded into the ointment for the ordination of the priest. This ointment … was also used to fumigate the holy enclosed space. The ointment (absorbed through the skin) and the fragrance of the vessels (both absorbed by handling and inhaled as perfume) and the smoke of the incense in the confined space would have been a very effective means of administering the psychoactive properties of the plant. Since it was only the High Priest who entered the Tabernacle, it was an experience reserved for him… (Ruck, 2009). The discovery of cannabis residue on an ancient altar in Israel is presented with amazement by the archaeologists although one wonders where they have been for the last century. The kanehbosem of Exodus was identified as cannabis by Sula Benet nearly a century ago and has been the subject of numerous works since.

More recently, Peter Margolis, who holds degrees in Jewish Studies from the Hebrew University in Jerusalem, visited this topic in “Lessons of Eish Zarah: The Ritual use of Kaneh-Bosm.” Noting Sula Benet’s etymological research, the recent archaeological evidence from tel Arad and other evidence, Margolis wrote, “combination of historical, anthropological, archaeological, and etymological studies strongly suggest that one of the ingredients of the Hebrews’ incense was cannabis” (Margolis, 2021). As Israel has become a leading figure in medical cannabis and research, and with the discovery of tel Arad, Jewish religious views seem to be coming more open to the possibility that kaneh bosm is cannabis. Rabbi Baruch HaLevi, the spiritual leader of Congregation Shirat Hayam, one of the fastest growing congregations in the Greater Boston area, was recently quoted in Jewish Boston: “It is not a stretch to say that kaneh bosem in Shemot and the other mentions in Tanach is what we call cannabis.” Benet’s etymological research regarding the Hebrew terms kaneh bosem and kaneh was based in part upon tracing the modern word “cannabis” back through history to show the similarities between the cognitive pronunciation of “cannabis” and “kaneh bosem” and comparing the term to the names used for cannabis by contemporary kingdoms, This author’s view differs in this respect, and I would suggest the term “kaneh bosem,” (also rendered q’neh bosem and keneh bosm) is the Hebrew transliteration of an earlier Indo-European term for the plant “kanna” combined with the Hebrew term for fragrance “bosem.” The Indo-European term “kanna,” was spread around the ancient world by nomadic Scythian tribes, and has left traces through the vernacular “an” seen in various modern terms for cannabis in Indo-European family languages, such as the Indian bhang, the Persian bhanga, the Greek kannabis, the French chanvre, the Dutch canvas and the German hanf. This is also the view of Prof. Carl Ruck who has commented that “kaneh bosem in Hebrew … is now recognized as the Scythian word that Herodotus wrote as kannabis (or cannabis)” (Ruck, 2009). Anthropologist Weston La Barre noted in regard to this as well: The word would seem very old in Indo-European, rather than multiply borrowed.… If as the anthropologist Sula Benet proposes, the cannabis terms are borrowed from a Semitic language, then there is the problem of a seemingly pan-Indo-European term diffused from ancient northern Eurasia.

And cannabis, of course grows wild in north central Eurasia, whence the Indo-Europeans came. That the terms [in IE languages for cannabis] are manifest dialectic equivalents would constitute the solidest possible evidence for the antiquity of the word, since the undivided Neolithic Indo-Europeans began to migrate (spreading prehistorically all the way from Ireland to Ceylon) and to break up dialectically in the early Bronze Age (La Barre, 1980). The Indo-European root for cannabis is kanna and its appearance in the Hebrew language shows that cannabis came to the Near East from foreign sources and, as an item of trade, likely via the Scythians. As an item of trade it retained the same name it arrived with. Indeed, in the Jeremiah 6:20 and Ezekiel 27:19 references to kaneh referred to by Benet, cannabis is identified as coming on a caravan from a foreign land. Certain researchers, who claim the designation of “calamus” as kaneh bosem stands correct, have failed to note that the plant kaneh is clearly described as an item of trade from a foreign land in both the Ezekiel and Jeremiah and these references disallow the Septuagint identification with calamus, as calamus is indigenous to the area in question and can commonly be found throughout the Middle East (Bennett & McQueen, 2001). Besides the linguistic evidence for the Hebrew kaneh, being an adoption of the Indo-European “kanna,” the archaeological evidence clearly indicates that the cannabis used in rituals at tel Arad, also arrived as an item of trade, as did the frankincense that was burned on the altar beside it. This concurs specifically with Jeremiah 6:20 references to both frankincense and kaneh, as coming from a “distant land.” It is likely that cannabis arrived in the ancient Near East via Scythian traders. A number of artifacts attest to the Scythians’ activity in the region, and other IE groups were deeply involved in the trade routes as well. The city now known as Beit She’an was originally called Bethshan but was later renamed Scythopolis by the Greeks during the Hellenistic period, since many Scythians had settled there during the great invasion of Palestine in the seventh-century B.C., during the reforms of Josiah. The Scythians were but a small part of a larger Indo-European cultural complex that used cannabis in funerary rituals. The term Scythian itself, is broadly used here to identify a wide range of interacting Indo European tribes who shared both language and cultural traits, that extend back deep in history.

There is no doubt that Allegro was at one time ogist, but that all went out the window when he wrote The Sacred Mushroom and the Cross (1970). Let me give you an example of some of Allegro’s philological work, in regards to a word that I have spent considerable time studying the origins of, “Cannabis.” Allegro made etymological arguments suggesting that the Greek term “Kannabis” somehow referred to a mushroom top, and “red hashish” belladonna or nightshade! This caused him to miss the actual indications of cannabis use in the Hebrew Bible narrative, now confirmed by archaeological evidence. Here is a quote from Allegro on cannabis: The herb which gave them their name, khaslzish, “Hashish,” means in Arabic no more than ‘dried herbage’. If used of a particular drug it properly requires some qualification, like “Red Hashish,” meaning Belladonna, Deadly Nightshade. The word Hashish alone has become attached to one particular form, Cannabis sativa, or Hemp, and the enervating drug made from its resin. But it is difficult to believe that the “pot”-smokers of today, the weary dotards who wander listlessly round our cities and universities, are the spiritual successors of those drug-crazed enthusiasts who, regardless of their safety, stormed castles and stole as assassins into the strongholds of their enemies. If their “Hashish” correctly interprets Cannabis then the latter must represent some more potent drug. The Greek word Kannabis may now be traced to the Sumerian element GAN, “mushroom top,” followed by the word which we saw earlier was part of the name of the New Testament Barnabas, and meant “red, speckled with white,” denoting, in other words, the color of the Amanita muscaria. As well as the transfer of its name to the less powerful “Hashish,” it underwent a jumbling of its form to produce the Greek Panakës, a mysterious plant also called Asciepion (elsewhere used of the mushroom), which required atonement to the earth of various cereals when pulled up. It seems, therefore probable that the original Cannabis was the sacred fungus, and that the drug which stimulated the medieval Assassins to self – immolation was the same that brought the Zealots to their awful end on Masada a millennium earlier. Indeed, we may now seriously consider the possibility that the Assassin movement was but a resurgence of a cultic practice that was part of Islam from the beginning, and had its real origin thousands of years before that. It seems", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634243995_cleaned.txt:56:d32d27c12f23", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 2006, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634243995_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634243995", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634243995_cleaned", "chunk_index": 57, "text": "seems, therefore probable that the original Cannabis was the sacred fungus, and that the drug which stimulated the medieval Assassins to self – immolation was the same that brought the Zealots to their awful end on Masada a millennium earlier.

It seems to be a pattern of religious movements based on the sacred fungus that long periods of relative calm and stagnation are interspersed with flashes of violent extremism which die away again after persecution, only to reemerge in much later generations. In this, history is reflecting the action of the drug itself on its partakers. After hectic bouts of uncontrolled activity, the fungus-eater will collapse in a stupor from which only a resurgence of the stimulatory poison in his brain will arouse him (Allegro, 1970). Allegro never smoked marijuana, but his own observations of what he referred to as “the ‘pot’-smokers of today, the weary dotards who wander listlessly round our cities and universities,” caused him to discount any possible use of cannabis as a means of achieving spiritual ecstasy. In The Sacred Mushroom and the Cross, Allegro translated the Kaneh-Bosm reference in Exodus as aromatic cane when mentioning the holy unction of the Hebrew Bible, even commenting how the anointing oil would have added to a “kind of intoxicating belief in self-omniscience,” but failed to make the rightful connection with cannabis. The traditional Israelite anointing oil: myrrh, aromatic cane, cinnamon, and cassia, all representing the powerful semen of the god. Under certain enclosed conditions, a mixture of these substances rubbed on the skin could produce the kind of intoxicating belief in self-omniscience referred to.… Furthermore, the atmosphere of the oracular chamber would be charged with reek of sacred incense consisting of “sweet spices. stacte, and onycha, and galbanum, sweet spices with pure frankincense…” (Exod. 30: 34). giving the kind of overpowering hypnotic effect referred to by an early … writer when he speaks of “the frenzy of a lying soothsayer” as a “mere intoxication produced by the reeking fumes of sacrifice.” That these ingredients formed only part of the sacred incense formula is well known. Josephus says there were thirteen elements, and the Talmud names eleven, plus salt, and a secret “herb” which was added to make the smoke rise in a vertical column before spreading outwards at the top. With the characteristic shape of the mushroom in mind, we can hazard a fair guess now at this secret ingredient (Allegro, 1970). It is well known that hashish smoke rises in this exact way, and there are no indications of psychoactive mushrooms in the temple incense by any stretch. Sadly, Allegro’s legacy is a mistaken hypothesis about mushrooms as the", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634243995_cleaned.txt:57:ecea88edf433", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 2007, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634243995_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634243995", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634243995_cleaned", "chunk_index": 58, "text": "secret “herb” which was added to make the smoke rise in a vertical column before spreading outwards at the top.

Sadly, Allegro’s legacy is a mistaken hypothesis about mushrooms as the sacrament of a desert people. Allegro missed the etymological clues for cannabis, the use of which has now been confirmed by archaeological evidence out of tel Arad, documenting its use in a Jewish temple site from 800 BCE. Moreover, the general consensus is that the root word for “Cannabis” originated in a Proto-Indo-European word kanap and from there spread through various later Indo-European family languages. No respected linguist or etymologist supports Allegro’s preposterous assertions on the term “Cannabis.” The IE Roots of Kaneh and Cannabis’ Ritual Use he Indo-European language is the mother tongue of many modern T dialects. Ancient Sanskrit, Greek, Latin, Hittite, Old Irish, Gothic, Old Bulgarian, Old Prussian, and many of the languages of Iran, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Bangladesh, and India have their common roots in Indo-European languages. In our own time, surviving Indo-European languages with over 100 million speakers include English, Hindi-Urdu, Spanish, Bengali, French, Russian, Portuguese, German, and Punjabi (there are others but they are declining and in danger of extinction). Knowledge of the Indo-Europeans comes chiefly from that linguistic reconstruction, along with material evidence from archaeology and archaeogenetics. The Proto-Indo-Europeans likely lived during the late Neolithic, roughly the 4th millennium BCE. Mainstream scholarship places them in the Pontic-Caspian steppe zone in Eastern Europe (present day Ukraine and southern Russia). It is in these same regions we find the earliest evidence of the ritual use of cannabis, and dating back to this same period. This was a technique of religious ecstasy still found at Indo-European sites thousands of years later at diverse locations, Western and Eastern Europe, Persia, India and even stretching into central China with IE groups who settled there.

Archeology has shown how the Proto-Indo-European Yamnaya culture brought cannabis into Europe and the Near East. Ritual use of cannabis in funerary rites in the region inhabited by the Yamnaya goes back at least 5,500 years, as evidenced through a find of skeletal remains and burnt cannabis seeds recovered at a burial mound at modern day Gurbăneşti, Romania. (Rosetti, 1959). The authors of The Encyclopedia of Indo-European Culture note that “Hemp has not only been recovered from sites in Romania but also from a Yamma burial at Gurbanesti (Maldova) where traces were found in a ‘censer’ (a shallow footed bowl believed to have been used in the burning of some aromatic substance). It has been found in a similar context from an early bronze age burial in the north Caucasus.… Ceramics were more elaborate than those of the Yamma culture and included, especially in female burials, low footed vessels interpreted as ‘censers,’ presumed to be used in rituals involving some narcotic substance such as hemp” (Mallory, et al., 1997). The late British archaeologist Andrew Sherratt, notes of this “It seems, therefore, that the practice of burning cannabis as a narcotic is a tradition which goes back in this area some five or six thousand years and was the focus of the social and religious rituals of the pastoral peoples of central Eurasia in prehistoric and early historic times” (Sherratt, 1995). When we add the evidence for the Near East ritual use of cannabis, we can begin to understand how widespread this practice was in the ancient world. Although there is archaeological evidence that cannabis was prepared into a drink at some of these IE sites, the earliest and most widespread evidence indicates it was burnt in Braziers of heated rocks, in enclosed places at the sites of tombs in a rite for the dead. Generally a tipi-like structure held in the fumes. Nomadic Scythians had a portable set-up for their ritual use that consisted of a small bronze brazier and a tent to capture the fumes. Herodotus wrote of their ritual use of cannabis, but this was largely considered mythical until the Russian archaeologist Sergei Rudenko recovered the implements used at a Scythian burial site in Siberia in the 1940s. Since that time several other Scythian burial sites with evidence of ritual cannabis use have been discovered at various locations.

As the authors noted from the collected evidence, “We can start to piece together an image of funerary rites that included flames, rhythmic music, and hallucinogen smoke, all in- Right: Six sticks of a smoking tent frame and brazier, a cloth would have been placed over the frame and then when the cannabis was placed upon the heated rocks on the brazier, the user would place their head inside the tent and inhale the captured fumes.

Cannabis has also been recovered in a similar context at Indo-European sites in China. tended to guide people into an altered state of mind.” Yimin Yang, an archaeologist at the University of Chinese Academy of Sciences and a co-author of the study, further clarified in the media that cannabis was “being used during funeral rituals, possibly to communicate with nature or spirits or deceased people, accompanied by music.” DNA of human remains at some of these sites, as well as artifacts indicates an Indo-European origin for the people and practices, which can be seen reflected in the similar rites of the Scythians and likely originated with the Proto-Indo-Europeans as can be seen through the etymology of the word cannabis, and evidence recovered in Ukraine and Romania which indicates similar funerary rites extending back to 3,500 BCE, noted above. As Melissa S. Cradic has noted in “Sensing the Dead in Household Burials of the Second Millennium BCE,” this sort of use of entheogenic plants is considerably ancient and widespread: “Globally, the presence of psychoactive substances in mortuary contexts has a long and rich history. For example, burnt cannabis seeds have been found in third millennium burials in Eastern Europe and the Caucasus. Intoxicating preparations of wormwood and cannabis occurred in Bronze Age burial mounds in Russia, and beer with hallucinogenic additives was attested in Spain during both the third millennium and second century BCE. From second millennium BCE Iberia opium residues in vessels and opium poppy seeds inside burials showed a similar use…” (Cradic, 2022).

The region in China these particular finds are from, the Pamir Plateau, was an essential channel of cultural communication and trade that connected ancient China, Central Asia, with southwest Asia and was a key point of the ancient Silk Road The Scythian and other Indo-European groups often acted as couriers. It was through such routes that cannabis arrived in the Near East, and indicates how the Hebrews and Assyrians adopted their own variants of the IE term kanna as kaneh bosm and qunubu as well as the ritual use of the plant. In later ritual magic, burning cannabis in this sort of context would be referred to as Capnomancy. As Ernest Bosc De Veze, who wrote A Treatise on Hashish, noted in Petite Encyclopedie Synthetique des Sciences Occultes, in reference to “capnomancy … for divination … the smoke obtained from psychic plants such as verbena, hashish or Indian hemp … [are] used” (Bosc, 1904). In cases like this, not only was there the psychoactive effect of the smoke used, but the smoke provided the partially material basis in which the invoked entity or vision might be viewed. Such use is indicated in one of the foundational documents of Western Magic, the 13th century Latin work Picatrix. Picatrix describes the use of cannabis resins in a incense to invoke the servant of the moon in a pillar of smoke above it, and the 10th century Arabic work from which it was largely copied, the Ghayat AlHakim, describes cannabis used in incense mixtures for temples in India. This ritual fumigation (or rather “suffumigation” through direct inhalation) required the magician, shaman or priest to stand or sit over the burning fumes of the preparation and inhale the smoke in an enclosed space, and from some of the ingredients and amounts used of these substances, we can be sure a ritual intoxications was received. The technique of ritual suffumigation of cannabis resins in an enclosed space, as indicated in tel Arad, likely followed with the adoption of the name kaneh bosm, as IE cultures are well known to have fumigated with cannabis in funerary rites for thousands of years before the time period we are dealing with in the Near East situation. Similar ritual use is indicated in Assyrian references and iconography as well, along with the IE cognate word for cannabis, qunubu. In the second quarter of the first millennium BCE, the “word qunnabu (qunapy, qunubu, qunbu) begins to turn up as for a source of oil, fiber and medicine” (Barber 1989). In our own time, numerous scholars have come to acknowledge qunubu as an early reference to cannabis.

In our own time, numerous scholars have come to acknowledge qunubu as an early reference to cannabis. As Prof. of Botany Richard Evens Schultes and father of LSD Dr Albert Hoffmann have noted “It is said that the Assyrians used hemp as incense in the seventh and eighth century before Christ and called it “Qunubu”( Schultes & Hoffmann 1979). A 2002 edition of the Compte Rendu, Rencontre Assyriologique Internationale, a journal from the Rencontre Assyriologique Internationale (RAI) the annual Assyriological Conference, in a paper on hashish and opium noted “Qunnabu or qunnubu has emerged as the best candidate for identifying cannabis.” The respected journal gives us some insights into the methods and extent of its use: “…A Neo-Assyrian recipe for making perfume speaks of steeped cannabis; a smoking pool is mentioned immediately in front of it. The context is unfortunately destroyed … cannabis together with other aromatics. Oil and wash was used in an unspecified ritual process…. Not insignificant quantities of this plant are delivered to the large temples – Eanna and Ebabbar.” Eanna was an ancient Sumerian temple in Uruk. Considered “the residence of Inanna” and Anu, is mentioned several times in the Epic of Gilgamesh. Ebabbar, was the temple of the sun-god Shamash, the chief deity of the pantheon. These were the main temple sites of the region. The Journal also notes that “In recipes, hemp is often combined with myrrh,” which may prove to be significant in reference to myrrhed wine and other Biblical references.4 The paper from the Compte Rendu, Rencontre Assyriologique Internationale, also refers to a ritual drink, thought to be entheogenic, but of unknown contents. However, as noted in Chapter 2 there is a surviving recipe for infused beer that contained cannabis and other aromatics, and was poured out in a drink offering to Ishtar, under the epithet of Beltu (Lady). In Science and Secrets of Early Medicine, Jurgen Thorwald records: “Quunabu – such was the Assyrian name for Indian hemp. This is basically the same word as it was later known by cannabis (Cannabis India), and hemp is cognate with it … it was often employed in Mesopotamia to relieve the pain of bronchitis, bladder trouble, rheumatism, and as a remedy for insomnia” (Thorwald, 1963). Likewise, as noted in the 1907 German edition of Mitteilungen zur Geschichte der Medizin und der Naturwissenschaften (Notes on the History of Medicine and Science) in reference to “the Indo-European plant names” that appear in Assyrian texts, “the plant qunubu – hemp corresponds exactly to the form of the name cannabis, as well.”", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634243995_cleaned.txt:62:8875efc372df", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 2012, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634243995_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634243995", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634243995_cleaned", "chunk_index": 63, "text": "cognate with it … it was often employed in Mesopotamia to relieve the pain of bronchitis, bladder trouble, rheumatism, and as a remedy for insomnia” (Thorwald, 1963).

Considering the cognate similarity between qunubu and kaneh bosem, there is no real reason to see the Mishnic kanabos, as a Greek adoption, but rather the phonetic continuation of these earlier Near Eastern terms. Indeed, a case could be made for an adoption of the Greek kannabis from these Near Eastern terms, rather than directly through the Scythian language. A plausible candidate for Cannabis sativa in Akkadian5 is the plant term qunnabu or qunubu. The name is a Wanderwort that has entered as loanword not only Akkadian but many other languages and cultures. Interestingly, the name qunnabu is attested relatively late in the ancient Mesopotamian record, namely from the eighth century BCE onwards. This late appearance fits well with the fact that wandering words spread usually through trade connections, and it occurs in cuneiform documents at a time the Assyrian and Babylonian empires reached their greatest territorial expansion and thus expanded commercial contacts. The origin of the Cannabis plant is thought to be Central Asia.… The Persian term is qinnap, re- ferring to both the plant and ropes made of hemp … and in all likelihood, it is the Persian name from which the Akkadian got its name. Interestingly, Persian qinnab and qunnab are often associated with the adjective Hindi “Indian,” pointing to the travel route that the plant took. The form with the final “s” comes from the original Greek qunbus, common Greek kannabis, which becomes Latin Cannabis … Akkadian qunnabu is almost exclusively attested as one ingredient among many in incense blends and perfume mixtures used in the religious cult… (Böck, 2022). Like the Hittites the Persians spoke an IE dialect, and they also traded with the Scythians, or “Saka,” as they were known in that region. In both the Assyrian and Hebrew references Q and K are used by translators of both Kaneh bosm and Qunubu, for the first letter, and the two words are linguistically connected by the same earlier Indo-European root word for cannabis, “kanna.” As well, it is known that cannabis came into India via the same Aryan groups who brought the Vedic religion with them.

The ritual use of Cannabis has continued since ancient times in India, to this day.6 Recipes for cannabis, qunubu, incense, regarded as copies of much older versions, were found in the cuneiform library of the legendary Assyrian king Ashurbanipal, (b. 685-ca. 627 BCE, reigned 669-ca. 631 BCE). Ashurbanipal was a scholar trained in the scribal arts and kept a private library in his palace in Nineveh. He took it upon himself to update and re-edit the medicinal texts of the past and methodically arrange them for better study and access. Ashurbanipal himself is credited with some of these chemical recipes. Cannabis was not only sifted for incense like modern hashish, but the active properties were also extracted into oils. “Translating ‘Letters and Contracts, no.162’ (Keiser, 1921), qu-un-na-pu is noted among a list of spices (Scheil, 1921)(p. 13), and would be translated from French (EBR), ‘(qunnapu): oil of hemp; hashish’” (Russo, 2005). An ancient Babylonian inscription reads: “The glorious gods smell the incense, noble food of heaven; pure wine, which no hand has touched do they enjoy.” According to Donald Alexander Mackenzie, in Babylonian religious rites, “inspiration was derived by burning incense, which, if we follow evidence obtained elsewhere, induced a prophetic trance. The gods were also invoked by incense” (Mackenzie, 1915). “Cannabis as an incense was burned in the temples of Assyria and Babylon ‘because its aroma was pleasing to the Gods’”(Benet 1975). A view that was shared by even earlier researchers: The Chaldean Magus [Mesopotamian holy men of the Chaldean kingdom, circa 400-500 BC] used artificial means, intoxicating drugs for instance, in order to attain to [a] state of excitement … acts of purification and mysterious rituals increased the power of the incantations.… Among these mysterious rituals must be counted the use of enchanted potions which undoubtedly contained drugs that were medically effective (Lenormant 1874). Records from the time of Ashurbanipal’s father Esarhaddon, (reigned 681-669 BC) give clear evidence of the importance of such substances in Mesopotamian rites, as cannabis, ‘qunubu’ is listed as one of the main ingredients of the pivotal ‘Sacred Rites’. This use is contemporary to that indicated in the Bible, and it should be noted both father and son appear in the Hebrew Bible narrative (Esarhaddon – II Kings 19:37, Isaiah 37:38, and Ezra 4:2: Ashurbanipal - Ezra 4:10). In a letter written in 680 BCE to the mother of the Esarhaddon, reference is made to qu-nu-bu, In response to Esarhaddon’s mother’s question as to “What is used in the sacred rites,” a high priest named", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634243995_cleaned.txt:64:8f40b4e39d04", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 2014, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634243995_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634243995", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634243995_cleaned", "chunk_index": 65, "text": "the pivotal ‘Sacred Rites’.

In a letter written in 680 BCE to the mother of the Esarhaddon, reference is made to qu-nu-bu, In response to Esarhaddon’s mother’s question as to “What is used in the sacred rites,” a high priest named Neralsharrani responded that “the main items … for the rites are fine oil, water, honey, odorous plants (and) hemp [qunubu].” Cannabis was clearly an important ritual implement from early on in Mesopotamia. Professor George Hackman referred to 4000 year-old inscriptions indicating cannabis in Temple Documents of the Third Dynasty of Ur From Umma. The inscription is described as a “Memoranda of three regular offerings of hemp” (Hackman, 1937). In The Cults of Uruk and Babylon, Marc Linssen notes another cultic use of cannabis, “some of the known aromatics, such as … qunnabu … are mentioned in the … Kettledrum ritual text TU 44, IV, 5ff… In the list of ingredients for this rite ten shekel qunnabu- aromatics” (Linssen, 2004). The Kettledrum was an object of divine inspiration, and their consecration often accompanied the ceremonies in opening a new temple, even their reskinning was ritualized, as the drum itself was a divine messenger. The sacrificing of a bull raised for this sacred purpose was called for the drum skin, and a priest would whisper incantations in its ear through a reed, which included the words “Great Bull that treadest the celestial herbage” (Hooke 1963). Conceivably the Bull was in a subdued state for both its receiving of incantations and ritual slaughter, and this may have been related to the requirement of cannabis for the ritual. One is reminded of the Biblical account of the Babylonian king Nebuchadnezzar eating “grass as doth an oxen” for seven years, in order to humble himself (Daniel 4:32). Possibly influenced by a common origin, Zoroastrian mythology recounts how the ailing Bull of Creation was eased of its pain with cannabis by the God of Light, Ahura-Mazda, “Ohrmazd gave the healing Cannabis, which is what one calls ‘banj’, to the ‘Gav’ [Bull] to eat” (Bundahishn 4:20). However, the references from Ashurbanipal and Esarhaddon certainly indicate its use by Kings in the sacred rites, and not just bovine! In a 1903 essay, “Indications of the Hachish-Vice in the Old Testament,” Dr. C. Creighton put forth the idea that the Biblical tale of Nebuchadnezzar eating grass “as doth an Ox^(′′) (Daniel 4:33) gave indication of cannabis use. He stated that “in the case of Daniel’s apologue of Nebuchadnezzar’s fall, it arises from the eating of ‘grass’, the Semitic word having both a generic and a colloquial meaning (hachish), as well as from the introduction of the subjective perceptions of", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634243995_cleaned.txt:65:8c8e2614aa5e", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 2015, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634243995_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634243995", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634243995_cleaned", "chunk_index": 66, "text": "In a 1903 essay, “Indications of the Hachish-Vice in the Old Testament,” Dr. C.

Kettledrums were an important ritual object, and imbued with the same sort of sacredness we see in the Exodus descriptions for the tools of the Inner Temple and Tent of the Meeting. From the ancient inscription, it would seem this cannabis fumigation ritual was a guarded secret of the Priests involved, we will see similar prohibitions around kaneh bosm later: You will make a libation of first quality beer, wine and milk. With censer and torch you will consecrate (the kettledrum). You will lead the Kettledrum before the gods.… The ritual procedure you perform, only the novice may see (it); an outsider, someone who is not responsible for the rites may not see (it) (because if this happens) his days will be short. The one who is competent may show the tablet only) to one who is (also) competent; he who is not competent may not see (it). Taboo of Anu, Enlil and Ea, the great gods. In detail from an ancient stele, king Esarhaddon stands before an elaborate curtained incense chamber with an altar base similar to that found in tel Arad. The tent was used to hold the smoke of cannabis incense, which the king would inhale by placing his head inside of it; a common means of marijuana inhalation in the ancient world, and an act of worship. In relation to this practice which like the word qunubu, is indicative of a Scythian influence, Brotteaux referring to ancient Assyrian use of cannabis, noted that “They called it ‘Quounoubo’ and employed it in the manner of the Scythians.”(Brotteaux, 1934) as a connection to the flood mythology, as well as Shamash, the sungod and chief of the pantheon. As noted earlier, Goddesses such as Inanna, Ishtar, and Ishara have been connected not only in their combined origins, but also with the ritual use of qunubu (Reiner, 1995; White, 2008) in the same way and context as Asherah can be with cannabis. These common connections help to identify the extremely ancient nature of this practice to a time period prior to their splitting off into their various regional personalities and rituals. Apparently cannabis was used not only as an incense, but in topical lotions as well, for both medicinal purposes such as skin conditions and dressing wounds, and also for spiritual purposes. As Dr. Ethan Russo noted; “cannabis was used with", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634243995_cleaned.txt:66:4d107fc96191", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 2016, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634243995_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634243995", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634243995_cleaned", "chunk_index": 67, "text": "the same way and context as Asherah can be with cannabis.

As Dr. Ethan Russo noted; “cannabis was used with the plant El in petroleum to anoint swelling … [and] was also employed as a simple poultice” (Russo 2005). More interestingly, records of topical ointments used in the treatment of “Hand of Ghost” an ancient malady now thought to be epilepsy, included cannabis as a key ingredient. A prescription for the disease was “Cannabis, styrax, oak, Ricinus, Oenanthe, linseed, kelp (?), myrrh, wax of honey, lidrusa-plant, sweet oil, together thou shalt mix, anoint him therewith with oil.” The following passage regarding the topical application of cannabis is very interesting when compared alongside the use of the cannabis infused “Holy Oil” for similar purposes amongst ancient Hebrew figures, that will be discussed later. “An Assyrian medical tablet from the Louvre collection (AO 7760)(Labat, 1950)(3,10,16) was transliterated as follows…, ‘ana min sam mastabbariru sam a-zal-la sam tarmus.’ Translating the French [EBR], we obtain, ‘So that god of man and man should be in good rapport:—with hellebore, cannabis and lupine you will rub him.’ (Russo 2005). However this last reference relies on another Assyrian term for its identification of cannabis, azallu, and there is a more general acceptance of the identification of qunubu as cannabis amongst researchers than with azallu, (Reiner, 1995). Although this term as well has its supporters, with some suggesting that azallu represents the earlier name for cannabis, which only later came to be popularly known as qunnubu, in the 8th century BCE: …In a review, Farber (Farber, 1981) pointed out that there is no unequivocal proof of cannabis being the identity of azallu. Other dictionaries have conservatively labeled it as “a medicinal plant” (Black, George & Postgate, 2000; Oppenheim et al., 1968), but, as we have seen, many of the great Assyriologists of the age accepted Thompson’s assignation, and it is certain that no other known plant in nature aside from cannabis remotely conforms to Thompson’s description of its attributes. We have a plant that was considered psychoactive, was used in fabric, was administered as a fumigant, insecticide, orally, cutaneously, and as an enema.

Ritual use of cannabis fiber in ancient Mesopotamia has also been noted: “hu-sab A.ZAL-LA’ to be knotted on a white thread and hung on the neck.” Azalla has also been seen as indicating that beverages were prepared from cannabis as well. “Cannabis was cited as a drink for unknown purposes (Thompson, 1949)(p. 221)(Thompson, 1923)(41,2,7). Similarly, (Oppenheim et al., 1968)(p.524) noted a potion of cannabis, ‘A.ZAL.LA isattima’ in (K. 13418)(97,2,4) (Thompson, 1923)” (Russo, 2005). There are other early Mesopotamian names besides azallu that unlike qunubu do not have any etymological indications of an Indo-European origin, and if they are indeed references to cannabis, this combined with their identification of going back as far as the third millennium, may mark an original indigenous cultic and medicinal use of cannabis. This could possibly be separate in origin to that of the traditions we have been discussing, or alternatively, interactions between these cultures date back to remote periods of time greater than what we have been dealing with in this study (which from what we have learned so far, is a very realistic possibility). As well, that cannabis may have held multiple names over these time periods, is more than a likelihood, as even today, cannabis is likely only second to “sex” for the amount of names which it can be recognized under. As the British Archaeologist Diana Stein has summarized in relation to ancient Near Eastern references: “Cannabis has many variants, and it is possible that these were known by a variety of different names, some cryptic and others descriptive or allegorical (as is the case today: marijuana, hashish, hemp, grass, weed, dope, pot, skunk, kit, bhang, etc.). The use of cannabis for incense during the first millennium BCE certainly suggests that its properties as an intoxicant were already known. The burning of incense tends to be a milder relic of earlier forms of consumption” (Stein, 2009). Qunnabu, the probable Assyrian word for cannabis, is attested in texts of the first millennium BCE. It occurs in a Neo-Assyrian recipe for perfume, and a contemporary letter refers to its use in ritual contexts. A later Neo-Babylonian text records the delivery of large quantities of qunnabu to the great temple of Eanna and Ebabbar, and there are recipes in which", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634243995_cleaned.txt:68:a29221805524", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 2018, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634243995_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634243995", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634243995_cleaned", "chunk_index": 69, "text": "already known.

So cannabis was available in Mesopotamia during the sixth century BCE at the time when the Hebrew Bible was compiled in Babylon (Stein, 2009). For more than a century various researchers have been trying to bring attention to potential cannabis references within the He-brew Bible. There have been a variety of suggestions regarding references to cannabis in scripture, and although the most convincing linguistic evidence for cannabis in the Bible, is Benet’s identification of kaneh bosm, these are worth consideration and discussion as well. These include: 1) Dr. C. Creighton’s 1903 essay, ‘Indications of the Hachish-Vice in the Old Testament’ which suggested Hebrew words for ‘honey wood’ and ‘honeycomb’ were hidden terms for a hashish confection. 2) Cannabis scientist Dr. Raphael Mechoulam’s suggestion of the Hebrew term pannag. 3) 19th century Biblical scholar John Kitto’s suggestion of shesh for fiber cannabis and eshisha for a resin product produced from the fiber plant. A British physician, Dr. C. Creighton, concluded in 1903 that sev- eral references to cannabis can be found in the Hebrew Bible. His examples were the “honeycomb” referred to in the Song of Songs, 5:1, and the “honeywood” in I Samuel 14: 25-45. Creighton felt that in the Hebrew Bible “there are some half-dozen passages where cryptic references to hachish may be discovered.… But that word, which is the key to the meaning, has been knowingly mistranslated in the Vulgate and in the modern version, having been rendered by a variant also by the LXX [Septuagint] in one of the passages, and confessed as unintelligible in the other by the use of a marginal Hebrew word in Greek letters” (Creighton 1903). plant, Cannabis sativa, was used for cordage in ancient times; and it is therefore probable that the resinous exudation, “honey” or “dew,” which is found upon its flowering tops on some soils, or in certain climates (Cannabis Indica), was known for its stimulant or intoxicant properties from an equally early date … we may assume it to have been traditional among the Semites from remote antiquity. There are reasons, in the nature of the case, why there should be no clear history. All vices are veiled from view; they are sub rosa; and that is true especially of the vices of the East.

Where they are alluded to at all, it is in cryptic, subtle … and allegorical terms. Therefore if we are to discover them, we must be prepared to look below the surface of the text (Creighton 1903). Creighton pointed to accounts like Nebuchadnezzar eating “grass as an ox” (Daniel 4:25), King Saul’s madness, Ezekiel’s Vision and other biblical events could be accounted for through the ingestion of cannabis. However, although interesting speculation, with no corroborative linguistic evidence, Creighton’s suggestion has garnered little attention. A copy of Creighton’s full essay has been included as an appendix. Dr. Raphael Mechoulam, is widely regarded for his localization and discovery of the molecule THC, and he has been studying the science and history of cannabis for decades. Mechoulam was aware of Sula Benet’s research, but suggested a different etymology and word. “Benet’s supposition is not unreasonable in view of the close etymological similarity between kaneh-bosem and the semitic forms of the word.… It seems to me more probable, however, that pannagh, an unidentified product exported through, Judea to Tyre, and mentioned by the prophet Ezekiel, was in fact cannabis” (Mechoulam, 1986) Mechoulam and associates at the Hebrew University in Jerusalem have suggested the following etymology for cannabis: Greek cannabis < Arabic kunnab < Syriac qunnappa < Hebrew pannag Ψ̄ = Ψ̄ bhanga in Sanskrit and bang in Persian). Mechoulam explains that in Hebrew, only the consonants form the basis of a word and the letters p and b are frequently interchangeable. In his view, this makes it probable that pannagh, which was seen as indicating a preparation of cannabis rather than a whole plant product, was the plant mentioned by the prophet Ezekiel as being an item of trade on an incoming caravan (27:17)1 . Mechoulam’s suggestion of “pannagh” may have some support through its similarity to the Egyptian Nepenthe, an infused wine many researchers have suggested contains cannabis and which we will look at later in a discussion of infused wines and ‘strong drink’. Interestingly it has been suggested that “Scythians took cannabis into Egypt via Palestine…”(Feinberg and Keenan, 2005). In A Glossary of Colloquial Anglo-Indian Words and Phrases, Yule and Crooke note an interesting connection between a Coptic (Greek-Egyptian) term and the nepenthe; “Bhang is usually derived from Skt. Bhanga, ‘breaking,’ but [Sir Richard] Burton derives both it and the Ar. Banj from the old Coptic Nibanj, ‘meaning a preparation of hemp; and here it is easy to recognize the Homeric Nepenthe’” (Yule, et al.,", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634243995_cleaned.txt:70:f9bfe14e4819", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 2020, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634243995_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634243995", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634243995_cleaned", "chunk_index": 71, "text": "has been suggested that “Scythians took cannabis into Egypt via Palestine…”(Feinberg and Keenan, 2005).

Banj from the old Coptic Nibanj, ‘meaning a preparation of hemp; and here it is easy to recognize the Homeric Nepenthe’” (Yule, et al., 1903/1996). As Abram Smythe Palmer also notes in Folk-etymology: “Nepenthe, the drug which Helen brought from Egypt, is without doubt the Coptic nibendj, which is the plural of bendj, or benj, hemp, ‘bang,’ used as an intoxicant” (Palmer, 1882). When one returns to the contemporary Avestan term for cannabis, b’aŋ’ha, the similarity in this context, ne- b’aŋ’ha, brings us to an even closer to the cognate pronunciation “nepenthe.” There is a lot of debate about the ingredients in nepenthe, so it serves as a questionable source for etymology.2 However, the reference to pannagh in Ezekiel, is the sole appearance of the term in the Hebrew Bible, so there is not a lot to go in regard to its further identification with ancient Israel, and it seems doubtful that it would have identified the precious substance that was burned in the Holy of Holies at tel Arad. n different publications of A Cyclopaedia of Biblical Literature, be-Iginning in 1845 and continuing for decades after, scholar John Kitto put forth two, potentially related, etymologies for both “hemp” and “hashish,” through Hebrew terms Shesh, which originates in reference to some sort of “fiber plant,” and the possibly related word, Eshishah, (E-shesh-ah) which holds connotations of “syrup” or “unguent.” SheshThe Hebrew word shesh, occurs twenty-eight times under another times in Ezekiel. Although often translated as “White linen,” considerable doubts have long been entertained respecting the true meaning of the word. A number of sources have suggested this was a specific reference to hemp cloth. The term shesh also refers to the number six, and some have seen this as identifying the number of stitches in the cloth (a six-ply linen thread). As with finds of cannabis resins in ancient Israel, there is also notable archaeological evidence for hemp cloth. Hemp fiber has been found in the Levant at the 800 BCE archaeological site of Deir ‘Alla, in a context which implies ritual use, (Boertien 2007). Hemp fiber has also been recovered from the later Talmudic period “Hemp in ancient rope and fabric from the Christmas Cave in Israel: Talmudic background and DNA sequence identification” (Murphy, et. al., 2011). “SHESH… also SHESHI, translated fine linen in the Authorized Version, occurs twenty eight times in Exodus, once in Genesis, once in Proverbs, and three times in Ezekiel.

Considerable doubts have, however, always been entertained respecting the true meaning of the word; some have thought it signified fine wool, others silk; the Arabs have translated it by words referring to colors in the passages of Ezekiel and of Proverbs. Some of the Rabbis state that it is the same word as that which denotes the number six, and that it refers to the number of threads of which the yarn was composed.… This interpretation, however, has satisfied but few… Shesh … must … be taken into consideration. In several passages where we find the word used, we do not obtain any information respecting the plant; but it is clear it was spun by women (Exod. xxx. 25), was used as an article of clothing, also for hangings, and even for the sails of ships, as in Ezekiel xxvii. 7. It is evident from these facts that it must have been a plant known as cultivated in Egypt at the earliest period, and which, or its fiber, the Israelites were able to obtain even when in the desert. As cotton does not appear to have been known at this very early period, we must seek for shesh among the other fiber yielding plants, such as flax and hemp. Both these are suited to the purpose, and were procurable in those countries at the times specified. Lexicographers do not give us much assistance in determining the point, from the little certainty in their inferences…. Hemp is a plant which in the present day is extensively distributed, being cultivated in Europe, and extending through Persia to the southernmost parts of India. There is no doubt, therefore, that it might easily have been cultivated in Egypt. We are, indeed, unable at present to prove that it was cultivated in Egypt at an early period, and used for making garments, but there is nothing improbable in its having been so. Indeed, as it was known to various Asiatic nations, it could hardly have been unknown to the Egyptians. Hemp might thus have been used at an early period, along with flax and wool, for making cloth for garments and for hangings, and would be much valued until cotton and the finer kinds of linen came to be known.… There is no doubt … that it might easily have been cultivated in Egypt.” Support for Kitto can be found in numerous sources, particularly in the 19th century but continuing on till the 20th as well.

In the 1901 edition of The Popular and Critical Bible Encyclopedia and Scriptural Dictionary, Samuel Fallows, and his co-authors reiterated much of what Kitto said, and concluded, as did John McClintock in The Strong Biblical Cyclopedia (1867). In The Plants of the Bible, John Hutton Balfour shared the general 19th century view on the subject: “SHESH … The material of which this fine linen was wrought is considered by many to have been the produce of the hemp plant. This is rendered probable also by the similarity between shesh and the Arabic word haschesch which is applied to hemp. Hemp consists of the fibers of Cannabis sativa (Balfour, 1885). Closer to our own time, in The Bible Dictionary, Rand Williams writing under the heading of “Linen” notes that: “Some think [Hebrew] BUTZ, in Latin byssus, denotes cotton cloth, and SHESH that made of hemp” (Williams, 2015). However, this seems to be a minority view, and few modern authorities seem to address hemp as a possibility for shesh and express the more common general view, that the term shesh simply means fine linen, and address no specific plant. In the Institute Of Biblical Studies: The Book Of Genesis, Terry Puett shares the now common view that the “Hebrew word שֵׁשׁ ) shesh) is an Egyptian loanword that describes the fine linen robes that Egyptian royalty wore” (Puett, 2016). Not much of an attempt to identify the source of this fiber is currently being made. Microscopic analysis of Predynastic Egyptian textiles were performed by W.W. Midgley in the first quarter of the twentieth century. Midgley proposed that the fiber from a number of Predynastic, and some Dynastic sites could be identified with “hemp”(Midgley, 1937). Midgley wrote that “Hemp … is found in the Badarian, Predynastic, and Pan – grave clothes, and I find it in the Dynastic fabrics from the Badarian sites also” (Midgley, 1937). However, Midgley’s findings have been called into question, due to the now outdated methods of analysis employed.4 There are also other Archaeological claims of evidence of ancient hemp fragments. In The City of Akhenaten, Thomas Peet referred to “a three-ply hemp cord” (Peet, 1923). In Ancient Egyptian Materials & Industries, Alfred Lucas refers to “a large mat from El-Amârna [City of Akhenaten] was of palm fiber tied with hemp cords” (Lucas, 1937). This was mentioned more recently in An Ancient Egyptian Herbal, Lise Manniche reported hemp fibers recovered from the tomb of Akhenaten (Amenophis IV),", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634243995_cleaned.txt:73:37bfa10398ab", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 2023, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634243995_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634243995", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634243995_cleaned", "chunk_index": 74, "text": "analysis employed.4 There are also other Archaeological claims of evidence of ancient hemp fragments.

This was mentioned more recently in An Ancient Egyptian Herbal, Lise Manniche reported hemp fibers recovered from the tomb of Akhenaten (Amenophis IV), dated ca. 1350 BCE (Manniche, 1989). However here again, there are uncertainties surrounding this identification. n the Hebrew term eshisha, Kitto saw a counterpart to shesh, indi-I cating a syrup or resin product. The word has been translated in various ways, leading to confusion regarding its origin and identity. Moreover, Kitto suggested eshisha as the likely root for the later Arabic term hashish, which most modern researchers suggest is derived from a general Arabic term, meaning “dried herb.” The word shesh … appears to us to have a very great resemblance, with the exception of the aspirate, to the Arabic name of a plant, which, it is curious, was also one of those earliest cultivated for its fiber, namely hemp. Of this plant, one of the Arabic names is … husheesh, or the herb par excellence, the term being sometimes applied to the powdered leaves only, with which an intoxicating electuary is prepared. This name has long been known, and is thought by some to have given origin to our word assassin, or hassasin. Makrizi treats of the hemp in his account of the ancient pleasure grounds in the vicinity of Cairo, “famous above all for the sale of the hasheesha, which is still greedily consumed by the dregs of the people, and from the consumption of which sprung the excesses, which led to the name of ‘assassin’ being given to the Saracens in the holy wars.” (Kitto,1856). ESHISHAH, eshishah, once translated “flagon” only: in three passages “flagon of wine” and once “flagon” with grapes joined to it in the original, as noticed in the margin (Hosea iii. 1). The Sept. renders it in four different ways, viz … “a cake from the frying-pan… ( 2 : S_(am) . vi. 19); in another part, which narrates the same fact … “a sweet cake of fine flour and honey” (1 Chron. xvi. 3) … “a cake made with raisins” (Hos. iii. 1), raisins here corresponding to “grapes” in the Hebrew; and by one copy …”sweet cakes” (Cant. ii. 5) ; but in others “unguents” [!-emphasis added]. In the Targum to the Hebrew… tzappikhith. in Exod. xvi. 31, the Chaldee term is … [Hebrew] ethiilian, “a cake,” rendered in our version by “wafers.” Eshishah has been supposed to be connected with [Hebrew] … ash, “fire” and to denote some sort of “sweet cake” prepared with fire; but the second part of the", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634243995_cleaned.txt:74:448649d63c04", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 2024, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634243995_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634243995", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634243995_cleaned", "chunk_index": 75, "text": "1), raisins here corresponding to “grapes” in the Hebrew; and by one copy …”sweet cakes” (Cant. ii. 5) ; but in others “unguents” [!-emphasis added].

Perhaps the following extract from Olearius (1637) may throw light on the kind of preparations denoted by shemarin [preserves or jellies] and eshishah: “The Persians are permitted to make a sirrup of sweet wine, which they boyl till it be reduc’d to a sixth part, and be grown as thick as oyl. They call this drug duschab [debhash], and when they would take of it, they dissolve it with water.… Sometimes they boyl the duschab so long that they reduce it into a paste, for the convenience of travelers, who cut it with a knife, and dissolve it in water.’ At Tabris they make a certain conserve of it, which they call halva … mixing therewith beaten almonds, flour, &c. They put this mixture into a long and narrow bag, and having set it under the press, they make of it a paste, which grows so hard that a man must have a hatchet to cut it. They make also a kind of conserve of it, much like a pudding, which they call zutzuch, thrusting through the middle of it a small cotton thread to keep the paste together.… Amongst the presents received by the ambassadors there is enumerated ‘a bottle of scherab [syrup] or Persian wine” … This zutzuch is but a harsh corruption of the Hebrew eshishah, and is by others called hashish and achicha. Even this substance, in course of time, was converted into a medium of intoxication by means of drugs. Hemp is cultivated and used as a narcotic over all Arabia. The flowers, when mixed with tobacco, are called hashish. The higher classes eat it (hemp) in a jelly or paste called majoon mixed with honey, or other sweet drugs … De Sacy and Lane derive the name of the Eastern sect of “Assassins” (Hashshusheen), “hemp- eaters,” from their practice of using shahdanaj [Persian – cannabis] to fit them for their dreadful work. El-ldreesee, indeed, applies the term Hasheesheeyeh to the “Assassins”(Kitto, 1845/1854). Another interesting possible derivative of shesh is the Hebrew word for lily - הנשוש / ןשוש shoshana.5 Ibn Ezra connects shoshana to shesh in his analysis of Shir HaShirim 2:2: “It is a white flower of sweet but narcotic perfume, and it receives its name because the flower has, in every case, six [shesh] petals, within which are six long filaments.” The Midrash refers to it", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634243995_cleaned.txt:75:a7ce1ee78c31", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 2025, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634243995_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634243995", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634243995_cleaned", "chunk_index": 76, "text": "for their dreadful work.

An entry in the Jewish Encyclopedia from Rabbi Emil Hirsch, and Rabbi Immanuel Löw, notes that the “identifications of the ‘lily-of-the-valleys’ (ib. ii. 1) and the ‘royal lily’ of the Syriac translation of Ecclus. (Sirach) xxxix. 14 and the Mishnah (Kil. v. 8; ‘Tiḳḳunim,’ iii. 78, l. 2) are uncertain, although the latter has been regarded plausibly as a species of Fritillaria.” Despite differences on whether the term shesh specifically identified “hemp” or “fine linen,” the general view has maintained that the term was an Egyptian loan word, that would have been picked up in the pre sojourn residence of Egypt, prior to the Exodus. The name of cannabis in Egypt, is shemshemet, which would be a big jump phonetically to the Hebrew shesh, but is not without possibility. Egyptian texts with fibrous and medicinal properties, as well as edible seeds, under the name shemshemet, or sm-sm-t, are now generally regarded as identifying cannabis. In ancient Egypt the healing herb shemshemet was believed to have been a creation of the Sun God Ra. Besides this linguistic source, pollen analysis of ancient soil layers and deep tissue samples from Egyptian mummies, have indicated that in Egypt, like much of the rest of the ancient world, cannabis held an important role. In fact from about 3000 BC onward there is evidence of cannabis pollen in Egypt. According to the Codex of Ancient Egyptian Plant Remains, (1997) pollen has been identified at Egyptian sites dating from the Predynastic period (c.3500-3100 BCE); the 12th Dynasty (c.1991-1786 BCE) includes not only pollen, but also a hemp “fiber (ball)”; from the 19th Dynasty (c.1293-1185 BCE) found on the Mummy of Ramses II; and the Ptolemaic period (323-30 BCE) (Vartavan & Asensi, 1997). At this place the Institute of Egyptology of the University of Tubingen is excavating a graveyard which was used from the 6th Dynasty until the Roman period.… Here some wine amphorae were excavated, from the bottom of which we obtained samples of organic material for pollen analytical investigations.… The useful plants, Cerealia and Humulus/Cannabis were present (Rosch, 2004).

As it has been suggested that this term shesh has an Egyptian origin, it would be interesting to find a suggested root that helped further its identification. In regard to cannabis, the suggested Egyptian name is shemshemet. No clear connection has been suggested between the two terms that I am aware of. However, as the Israelites are said to have come out of Egypt, a look at Egyptian references for another possible source of influence, seems prudent and a paper on this has been included in the appendix. Yahweh, who came to be the National God of Israel, is of un-known and complicated origins. As the story of how he be-came the one supreme god of Israel is wrapped up with the cancellation of the Holy of Holies at tel Arad, as well as the kaneh bosm references we will be discussing in the next chapters. For this to make sense a bit of an understanding of how Israel was taken from polytheism to monotheism is required. The focus of this book is not a complete breakdown of biblical monotheism, so this is an intentionally brief overview of some of the main points. I only delve into this here, as the story of the rise and fall of the ritual use of cannabis, is wound up with the rise of monotheism and the fall of polytheism. There are many well written scholarly works, which describe the polytheistic nature of the ancient Near East and Israel, and how one deity rose to prominence out of the many in great detail. For those who seek a deeper understanding of the current scholarship on this, there are numbers of detailed books such as Mark Smith’s The Origins of Biblical Monotheism: Israel’s Polytheistic Background and the Ugaritic Texts (2001) or Gods, Goddesses, and Images of God in Ancient Israel (Keel & Uehlinger, 1998).

The vowels used in the pronunciation of Yahweh are unknown and no clear etymology of the name exists in Hebrew, or any known language. The worship of Yahweh is thought to have come from foreign sources into Israel. Even in the Bible, Abraham brought the God of his fathers with him out of Ur, so from even the fundamental perspective, Yahweh was an import, not an indigenous god. The oldest reference to the name of Yahweh, is about 3,500 years old, a challenge for the Biblical creationist, who places the origins of the world itself at about 6,000 years ago. Regardless of his origins, it was Yahweh alone, that arose out of the plethora of Gods and Goddesses of the ancient Near East, to be worshiped as the One supreme God of the Jewish people. Considering there are an estimated 2.5 billion people who pray to and believe in Yahweh, and the other ancient Gods and Goddesses of the Levant are only remembered in the history books, this has been a very successful campaign. Like other ancient deities, it is believed that Yahweh originated as an answer to explain natural phenomena. Ancient people around the with the worship of sun gods like Shamesh, ocean god like Neptune and his counterpart Poseidon, grain goddesses, fertility goddesses, rain gods etc., etc. In the case of Yahweh, the general view is his worship and identity arose to explain volcanoes and storms. Throughout the Hebrew Bible, Yahweh’s appearance coincides with volcanic-like phenomena. When Yahweh descends from Mt. Sinai to reveal the Torah to Moses and his people, the mountain bursts forth with fire, spewing lava and billowing clouds of smoke accompanied by both earthquakes and thunderstorms (Exodus 19:16-19). Psalm 18:18 describes Yahweh as billowing with smoke and fire “smoke rose from his nostrils; consuming fire came from his mouth, burning coals blazed out of it.” Like the other gods of his day, Yahweh required copious animal sacrifices, ones which would make a modern Vodou ritual seem like a friendly weenie roast in comparison. Another reason that the Hebrews burned copious amounts of fragrant incense in and around their places of worship was the unbearable stench from the massive animal sacrifices. These sacrifices were a daily occurrence and constituted a large part of ancient Hebrew worship. In fact, many of the laws and instruction recorded in the books of Moses are concerned with rules for proper sacrifice; which from the descriptions given, must have been a very gruesome sight indeed: This is what you are to do to consecrate … priests.

Then take all the fat around the inner parts, the covering of the liver, and both kidneys with the fat on them, and burn them on the altar.… Take one of the rams.… Slaughter it and take the blood and sprinkle it against the altar on all sides. Cut the ram into pieces.… Then burn the entire ram on the altar. It is a burnt offering to the lord, a pleasing aroma, an offering made to the Lord by fire (Exodus 29:1-20). This was typical of Near Eastern worship, and by no means something particular to the worshipers of Yahweh alone. Again like the other deities of the ancient Near East, Yahweh was part of a pantheon of deities, and the decline and disappearance of this polytheism, or more distinctly Poly-Yahwism, as Yahweh came to head a pantheon, is wound up with the eventual disappearance of cannabis from Hebrew worship. The leading theory on how the worship of Yahweh came to the Israelites is known as The Kenite Hypothesis (also known as The Midianite Hypothesis) which has Yahweh originate with a foreign group of miners and blacksmith, who brought the worship of Yahweh to Canaan. Once in Canaan Yahweh was adopted into an existing pantheon there, and Yahweh became one of the 70 sons of Canaanite high god El, many of whose attributes he would later come to take for himself. The Kenites were members of a nomadic tribe of metalworkers and coppersmiths, often described as a sect of the Midianites, although some see distinctions between the two. Jethro, the father inlaw of Moses, is described as both a Kenite and Midianite. Jethro is further identified as a priest of Yahweh and a tribal leader. It was only after meeting Jethro that Moses would later reveal to the Hebrews that Yahweh was their own God whom they had forgotten. Moreover, it was while working for Jethro that Moses had his first meeting with Yahweh through the burning bush. When Jethro inaugurated the Tent of the Meeting, he proclaimed “Yahweh is greater than all other gods” (Exodus, 18:11).

When Jethro inaugurated the Tent of the Meeting, he proclaimed “Yahweh is greater than all other gods” (Exodus, 18:11). The Kenite theory is seen as bolstered by what are considered the first inscribed references to the name of Yahweh, in an inscription referring to a semi-nomadic semitic group known in Egyptian writings as the Shasu. It is believed the root behind the name Shasu, indicates a “wandering” or nomadic people and refers primarily to a group of nomadic people who were located primarily in Syria-Palestine, and it is believed they may have also settled in regions of Canaan. The name Shasu is found in a variety of New Kingdom references including in administrative and military documents from the reigns of Thutmosis III, Amenhotep II, Thutmosis IV, Amenhotep III, Akhenaten,2 Seti I, Ramses II, Merneptah, and Rameses III. The Egyptian Pharaoh Amenhotep III, who is believed to have reigned around 1386 to 1349 BC, had a temple built in honor of the god Amun-Ra. The temple held a series of columns which listed various enemies the pharaoh had vanquished, with each listed alongside a depiction of the captive which depicted their ethnicity, and the indications in the image of the Shasu, portray semitic features, rather than the African ones more widely engraved. Most interestingly is the engraving that accompanied the image, “the land of the Shasu (nomads) of Yahweh.” Seir refers to a mountainous region stretching between the Dead Sea and the Gulf of Aqaba in the northwestern region of Edom. As noted earlier, fourteenth and thirteenth centuries B.C.E. Egyptian texts refer to “Yhw [Yahu] in the Land of the shasu,” while a twelfth century B.C.E. papyrus Anastasi VI links the Shasu tribes with Seir and Edom. In her article “Who Were the Kenites” Marlene Mondriaan notes of this: “The latter region was in the ‘South’, a territory frequented by the Kenites. It is therefore possible that a connection existed between the Shasu tribes and the Kenites and thus, by implication, linked the Kenites and Yhw” (Mondriaan, 2011). Mark S. Smith, Professor of Bible and Ancient Near Eastern Studies at New York University, has gone further and suggested that the Shasu could be added to the Midianite-Kenite combination, or at least came into deep contact with them. Egyptian records indicate conflicts with the Shasu over lands with copper resources, indicating they were metal workers and miners like the Kenite/Midianites. As a result of this connection the Midianite-Kenites adapted Shasu Yahwism to suit their own communities and sanctuary spaces, and conceivably, if we", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634243995_cleaned.txt:80:ab4aa2934896", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 2030, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634243995_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634243995", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634243995_cleaned", "chunk_index": 81, "text": "of Bible and Ancient Near Eastern Studies at New York University, has gone further and suggested that the Shasu could be added to the Midianite-Kenite combination, or at least came into deep contact with them.

As a result of this connection the Midianite-Kenites adapted Shasu Yahwism to suit their own communities and sanctuary spaces, and conceivably, if we are to consider Moses as a historical figure,3 through Jethro, the Father in Law of Moses, this worship was adopted by the Israelites. Alternatively Yahweh was imported into the land of Canaan by Shasu who had settled there, and Yahweh was adopted into the already existing pantheon of Canaanite gods. This introduction would have come as a shock to the various already existing Canaanite pantheon cults, and no doubt created conflict. A Semitic tribe forced out of Egypt like the Shasu, is clearly a scenario which conceivably may have influenced the Exodus migration myth. (There is little to no evidence for the mass exodus as described in the Biblical account). Archaeological finds at Kuntillet ‘Ajrud in the Sinai peninsula, which is believed to have been a shrine in the late 9th and early 8th centuries BCE, has inscriptions that make reference to “Yahweh of Teman” and “Yahweh of Samaria” along with dedications to El, Baal, and Asherah, indicating Yahweh as part of this wider pantheon and that he was worshiped in Edom (Teman) and in Israel (Samaria) early on, alongside these other deities. ElTranslations from the Hebrew record “El” as the more generic view is that the names Ēl and Ĕlōhîm, when used in the Hebrew Bible, refer to Yahweh alone, who in the earlier period is seen as more powerful than other Gods, while later, he becomes the sole God of the Universe. However, many historical scholars, basing their views on sources outside of the Hebrew Bible, see an altogether separate God, in the name El, and one whose identity morphed with that of Yahweh. Supporting the latter view, El appears in Ugaritic texts dating back to the second millennium, and this is seen as the same deity worshiped in Canaan as El. In Canaan, under the Hebrew influence, El’s imagery was increasingly adopted by the newcomer Yahweh’s cult, to the point the two became indistinguishable. This view has become increasingly popular with the discovery and translation of Ugaritic mythological texts. In El in the Ugaritic Texts, Professor Marvin Pope explains; “The Ugaritic mythological texts have completely dispelled any doubt as to the existence of El as the proper name of a specific deity. The long mooted question whether the Semites in general or any considerable section of them originally, or at least anciently, worshiped a god name El is now answered in the affirmative…” (Pope, 1955).

Originally the Supreme god of the Canaanite pantheon, sometime after the adoption of Yahweh, El became conflated with the new God, who acquired many of his attributes in this transition, and even El’s wife Asherah. Through various Ugaritic texts, we know he was the King and Father of the other Gods and Goddesses in the pantheon, and was coupled with Asherah as their mother. His sons included: Baal (Storm and War God); Yam (God of the Sea); Mot (God of the Underworld). Mot was appeased with child sacrifice, so came to be particularly despised, although Biblical condemnations seemed particularly focused on Baal, and this may be due to the two sharing so many attributes. ….In Canaan, the early Israelites, originally pastoral semi-nomads, were slowly becoming settled agrarians. As such they would have needed to worship deities who promoted their farming activities: a heterosexual couple one of whose concerns was the land’s fertility. In that worship they would be like the cultures surrounding them. What would be more natural, then, than their adopting and adapting deities from the agrarian peoples among whom they were settling? So they identified their main god with Canaanite El and, as consort for their own god, took over El’s female counterpart Asherah (Stuckey, 2004). Baal, as a storm and war god, shared these attributes with Yahweh, and this was likely a source of conflict early on between their sub-cults. In Ugaritic and Hebrew, Baal’s epithet as the storm god was “He Who Rides on the Clouds’.” Comparatively, Psalm 68:4 has been translated as describing Yahweh as “him who rides on the clouds.” Confusing matters, Baal means “Lord,” and was used as a generic title for a number of regional gods. Some scholars suggest that in earlier times “Baal” was even applied to Yahweh. Existing Biblical references to Baal are generally viewed as referring to Baal Hadad, who was worshiped by the Canaanites. As noted in Brad E. Kelle’s Hosea 2: Metaphor and Rhetoric in Historical Perspective all inscriptions from 8th century BCE Kuntilet Arjud “offer blessings in the names of El and Baal” and other fragments “also contain the names of Yahweh and Baal” (Kelle, 2005). Kelle’s notes that “many scholars” see the sexual imagery of Hosea 2, as being a metaphor for the Israelites “apostasy,” and they were either choosing the worship of Baal over that of Yahweh, or combining the two.

Kelle’s notes that “many scholars” see the sexual imagery of Hosea 2, as being a metaphor for the Israelites “apostasy,” and they were either choosing the worship of Baal over that of Yahweh, or combining the two. As noted in the early period, it appears that the name “Baal” was used by the Hebrews to refer to their God without concern, but as a competitive struggle between the cults of Baal and Yahweh developed, the name Baal became detestable. Hosea 2:16 indicates the cult of Yahweh’s anger at the obvious conflations which saw the two gods often combined by the Israelites “No Longer will you call me Baal.” In his book Origins of Biblical Monotheism (2001), Mark Smith, suggests that evidence of Yahweh as more of a bit player, can be determined from Psalm 82, which “presents Yahweh in an explicit divine council scene does not cast him as its head (who is left decidedly mute or undescribed, probably the reason why it survived the later collapsing of the different tiers)” (Smith, 2001). Psalm 82:6 refers to the “Sons of the Most High(Elyon) .” Smith suggests that “Elyon” here is “a title of El at an early point in biblical tradition (cf. El Elyon mentioned three times in Genesis 14:18-20). The term Elohim is a “Plural form usually translated in English Bibles as the singular ‘God’, because in Jewish thought there is only one supreme, true god” ( Jones, 1982). As Mark Smith explains in The Origins of Biblical Monotheism: “If this supposition is correct, these passages preserve a tradition that casts the god of Israel in the role not of the presiding god of the pantheon but as one of his sons. Each of these sons has a different nation as his ancient patrimony (or family inheritance) and therefore serves as its ruler” (Smith, 2001). Thus we see names like Baal and Yahweh incorporated into various place names, such as Baal-gad, Baal-hermon, Belmarkos, or in the case of the newer adopted God Yaweh, this name is incorporated into the second syllable of Judah, as is the name of the supreme deity El, into the last syllable of Israel. Many scholars have noted that in the stories of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, El was their god. Abraham does not know the name of Yahweh which is introduced much later in the story of Moses, and came through an introduction by his Midianite/Kenite Father-in-Law, Jethro. Exodus 6:2-3 reads “God also told Moses, ‘I am the LORD (Yahweh). I appeared to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob as God Almighty (El Shaddai), but by My name the LORD (Yahweh) I did not make Myself", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634243995_cleaned.txt:83:adb49f3b1f42", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 2033, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634243995_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634243995", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634243995_cleaned", "chunk_index": 84, "text": "noted that in the stories of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, El was their god.

I appeared to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob as God Almighty (El Shaddai), but by My name the LORD (Yahweh) I did not make Myself known to them.” Everywhere in the Hebrew Bible where the name “God” appears, is actually a translation of a word with El, as a component, and “Lord” is a translation of Yahweh. God Almighty here is an incorrect translation of El Shaddai, which is more correctly translated as “God of the Mountain” a known attribute of the Canaanite El. Exodus 6:3, shows the efforts to merge these two deities. The “House of God” Jacob builds is called Beth El, i.e. “The House of El.” Jacob’s name is changed to Israel, “El Perseveres” in two conflicting accounts: Genesis 32:22-28 where he gets the title after he wrestles with God, and the other Genesis 35:9-10 where El himself dubs Jacob “Israel” on his return from Paddan Aram. Yahweh is often identified in the Hebrew texts with the Canaanite El Elyon however, this was after a long process of conflation with El that came through religious syncretism which likely took place over a few generations. Over time, El (Hebrew: לא ( became a generic name for “God,” and was applied in epithets to a number of deities, as opposed to the name of just the supreme Canaanite God. Through this titles such as El Shaddai over time came to be applied to Yahweh alone. As well, Baal’s qualities of a storm god became increasingly assimilated into Yahweh’s own identification with storms and fire. Initially, the call for Yahweh alone worship, was not the denial that other gods existed, but rather their rejection. It was much later that the concept that there was only one god emerged. Thus the earlier supporters and some of the prophets of the Yahweh faction are widely regarded as being monolatrists rather than true monotheists. This means they did not deny the existence of other deities, but that for them, it was Yahweh alone who should be worshiped. The Hebrew Bible was created by the merging of various texts and traditions, particularly the reluctant marriage of the traditions of the “Yahwist Text,” said to embody the beliefs of the 9th century kingdom of Southern Judah, and the “Elohihist Text,” a compilation of the beliefs and myths of the eighth century BCE kingdom of Northern Israel. Throughout much of Kings and Chronicles these two kingdoms are in almost constant battle, sometimes allying with different powers in the region.

Throughout much of Kings and Chronicles these two kingdoms are in almost constant battle, sometimes allying with different powers in the region. In their last war, Judah allied with Assyria while Israel allied with another power named Aram. This last war led to the destruction of Israel by an Assyrian force in 723 B.C. under Hezekiah, and then later Josiah would see the Babylonians take over in Judah resulting in their period of Exile. An Assyrian influence on Judah, may account for the similar use of cannabis in the Yahwist Exodus 30:23 account as well as explain its presence within the Holy of Holies at tel Arad. This could also explain its cancellation, as Hezekiah had been on a mission to remove Assyrian religious influences from the Holy Land. As noted, in the later translations of the Yahweh text, Yahweh is always rendered in English as “Lord.” Mixed with this was the Elohist Text, which uses the plural Elohim to describe the deity and this word is translated as the singular “God” in most modern Bibles, although as noted above Elohim is an intensive Hebrew plural of the Canaanite singular deity name El, and in actuality it means “the goddesses and the gods.” After the fall of the Elohist kingdom in the north around 700 BC, the remnants of their sacred scriptures were taken to the southern kingdom of the Yahwist’s. The Yahwist point of view by an editor, apparently of the seventh century BC, merged the texts. Making things even more complicated, both the Elohist and Yahwist texts were restructured in the sixth century BCE to fit with the later “Deuteronomist Text.” These were in turn edited and revised around the fifth century BCE by a later group whose handiwork is known as the “Priestly Texts.” Modern translators of the Bible have carried on this tradition by often unconsciously making their translations fit in with their belief system, (i.e. translating the plural Elohim as the singular God), as did their earlier counterparts. Although, it shouldn’t be supposed that these re-writers and editors of the older Hebraic traditions were always forgers and falsifiers in our modern conception of the word. The ancients in general had no idea of literary ethics as we understand them, and writing of a religious character usually resulted from a calling of the inner spirit, which to people of this long ago time was identical to a calling from the gods. This merging of texts has created many contradictions in the Hebrew Bible narrative.

A close reading reveals that the Elohim of Genesis 1, is more androgynous than the later solely male deity, Yahweh-Elohim (Lord God) of Genesis 2, which was written much later and then inserted at the front of the Hebrew Bible. In Genesis 1:27, Elohim states; “So God created man in his own image, in the image of God he created him: male and female he created them.” Alternatively in Genesis 2, Man is created first, then later Eve is created from the rib of Adam after the Lord notices the first man’s loneliness and decides to create him a mate. In 1863 a Bishop John Colenso, noted other points of contention between the two differing cosmologies; 4. In the first man is created in the image of God. In the second, man is made of the dust of the ground; he is placed by himself in the garden, charged with a solemn command, and threatened with a curse if he breaks it; then the beasts are made, and the man gives names to them, and lastly, after all this, the woman is made out of one of his ribs, but merely as a helpmate for man. This is suggested at once by the circumstance that, throughout the first narrative, the Creator is always spoken of by the name Elohim (God), whereas, throughout the second account, as well as the story of the Fall, he is always called Jehovah Elohim (Lord God), except when the writer seems to abstain, for some reason, from placing the name Jehovah in the mouth of the serpent. This merging of texts took place in stages. Particularly during the reign of Hezekiah’s grandson Josiah, after the Fall of Israel to Assyria, and the alleged discover of Deuteronomy, “The Second Book of the Law,” during renovation at the Temple of Solomon. A “discovery” which saw drastic changes directed towards instilling and enforcing monotheism. Not only theological views led to monotheism, there were political reasons as well.

A kingdom divided by cults, was a kingdom divided, and Monotheism was a means of unified rule. These factors will be explored more thoroughly later. After the Fall of Jerusalem to the Babylonians, yet another group of editors, known as the Priestly group, are thought to have emerged. The Priestly Editors further worked the texts during the Exile, bringing us into the era of time where other gods were not only to be not worshiped, but also said to have no existence, and the concept of Yahwehist monotheism as we know it today, was more fully established. This new monotheistic theology came into Israel when the exiled Jews returned to their homeland. Monotheistic Judaism had to be taught and enforced on the people who had remained in Israel through the Exile, with foreigners the Babylonians had placed there and with whom they had intermarried. The cultural upheaval and trauma in this period, along with the loss of continuity of tradition here, can only be compared to what happened to the First Nations people of what is now the Americas. The story of the Bible, is in many ways, the story of the theological evolution of monotheism, and the story of cannabis in the Bible, is in many ways related to the cultural evolution of the development of religion itself and its origins in plant-based shamanic ecstasy. These two tales, as we shall see, are intertwined. Sula Benet chose 5 specific references to demonstrate that the terms kaneh and kaneh bosm, identified cannabis: Exodus 30:23; Song of Songs 4:14; Isaiah 43:24; Ezekiel 27:19 and Jeremiah 6:20. Unfortunately she only went into a limited description of the context of these references, and focused mostly on the Exodus account. When I first came across them, and looked them up, not having much of a background in the Bible at the time, I was puzzled. Read individually, they do not add up and make sense, or even clearly indicate cannabis. Moreover, the reference in Exodus is clearly positive, whereas the account in Jeremiah is clearly negative. This left me with the task of trying to understand these references in the context of the Hebrew Bible narrative – which took years. I have written about these references in earlier books trying to explain them, however, this question seemed destined to remain a debatable theory. That is, until the discoveries of cannabis resins on the altar in Arad. Curiously, historians discussing the tel Arad altars, rarely mention the kaneh and kaneh bosm references, and when they do, they don’t seem to be aware of the context of them, beyond the initial reference in Exodus 30:23.

When the references to kaneh are looked at in the context of the Biblical narrative, they fit seamlessly with the evidence found at tel Arad. The kaneh references indicate a sacred plant which had once been used within the confines of the Tent of the Meeting (Exodus 30:23) and later the Holy of Holies in Jerusalem (Isaiah 43:24), that later came to be rejected ( Jeremiah 6:20). The debate about tel Arad, has been whether the ritual evidence of cannabis use indicated heretical pagan practices, or mirrored the activities of the Holy of Holies in Jerusalem. In a sense, it can be seen as both. In both cases, the indication is a plant that was once considered holy, which came to be rejected through its association with Asherah in later times. The Holy Oil in the Tent of the MeetingThe first of the references to kaneh bosm occurs in the story of the Lord from “flames of fire within a bush.” Moses is a complicated figure historically, and outside of the accounts recorded in the Torah and adopted into the Bible, which would have been written down centuries after his alleged life, there is little to go on for evidence of his existence. It seems clear from a variety of ancient references, that many Hebrew people were unaware of his existence for centuries after his supposed lifetime. There is a lot of debate about this, more faithbased researchers see a single man and an authentic account of his life, whereas scholars are divided in Moses being composed from a collection of accounts and stories, a sort of composite figure, and still others as a much later complete fabrication. As the noted American anthropologist Weston La Barre stated “Moses is a … legendary figure, of whom consistency may not be expected. The foundling-child of the waters is a widespread myth, and one moreover of clear if complex symbolism: in the alleged life-history of Moses are many motifs of the ‘myth of the birth of the hero’ as well as the usual ‘family romance’ of royal parents and adoption…” (La Barre 1970). The assimilation of mythologies in building up the character of Moses can be seen right from its very beginnings, with Moses being placed in a basket of reeds and set adrift, an obvious adaptation of the much more ancient story of the secret birth of Sargon, the ancient Ruler of Agade (2371-2230 B.C.E), which is seen as a", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634243995_cleaned.txt:88:54023f1b788b", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 2038, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634243995_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634243995", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634243995_cleaned", "chunk_index": 89, "text": "‘myth of the birth of the hero’ as well as the usual ‘family romance’ of royal parents and adoption…” (La Barre 1970). The assimilation of mythologies in building up the character of Moses can be seen right from its very beginnings, with Moses being placed in a basket of reeds and set adrift, an obvious adaptation of the much more ancient story of the secret birth of Sargon, the ancient Ruler of Agade (2371-2230 B.C.E), which is seen as a likely source for the later Biblical tale (Gray 1969): My mother, an enitum, conceived me; in secret she bore me, She set me in a basket of rushes, with bitumen she sealed my lid, She cast me into the river, which rose not over me, The river bore me up and carried me to Akki, the drawer of water. Akki, the drawer of water lifted me out as he dipped his bucket. Akki, the drawer of water, took me as his son and reared me, Akki, the drawer of water, appointed me as his gardener. While I was a gardener, Ishtar granted me her love, And for four and … years I exercised kingship, the black-headed people I ruled, I governed. In Sex, Drugs, Violence and the Bible (Bennett & McQueen, 2001) we took the existence of Moses quite literally, intrigued by Freud’s suggestion in Moses and Monotheism (1939).1 Sigmund Freud hypothesized that the Semites had picked up the conception of the worship of one god in Egypt under the influence of heretic Pharaoh Akhenaten. The evidence of the Shasu of Yahweh in Egypt, does open up the possibility of a potential monotheistic influence at that early date, but the archaeological record, along with the annals of other ancient kingdoms, make it very unlikely that the sort of Exodus of Moses and the Israelites as described in the Hebrew Bible ever took place. However, when I later revisited this material in Cannabis and the Soma Solution (2010) it became clear that the ancient Hebrews did not become fully monotheistic until after the Babylonian Exile. Monotheism came through the influence of the Persians who returned them to Israel. Much of the supposedly earlier material in the Hebrew Bible, was either composed then or adapted to fit with a new monotheistic history. The general view among religious scholars is that the Book of Exodus was compiled as late as 600 BCE and finalized by 400 BCE. This would place it close to a thousand years after Moses and the Exodus is portrayed as occurring.2 We will touch on these sorts of elements in the back story here and there, as its relevant to the references we are discussing, but the intention of this study is on the particular cannabis references identified and establishing their context, not the historicity of Biblical figures.

Moreover, it is not important to establish Moses’ own historicity in regard to the first of the references of kaneh bosm, as the Exodus reference occurs in a recipe with a list of directions for the invocation and worship of the deity, Yahweh, that were to be followed by the priestly caste and particularly the High Priest. Then the Lord said to Moses, Take the following fine spices: 500 shekels of liquid myrrh, half as much of fragrant cinnamon, 250 shekels of fragrant cane [kaneh-bosm], 500 shekels of cassia – all according to the sanctuary shekel – and a hin of olive oil. Make these into a sacred anointing oil, a fragrant blend, the work of a perfumer. It will be the sacred anointing oil. Then use it to anoint the Tent of the Meeting, the ark of the Testimony, the table and all its articles, the lampstand and its accessories, the altar of incense, the altar of burnt offering and all its utensils, and the basin with its stand. You shall consecrate them so they will be most holy, and whatever touches them will be holy. Anoint Aaron and his sons and consecrate them so they may serve me as priests Say to the Israelites, “This is to be my sacred anointing oil for the generations to come. Do not pour it on men’s bodies and do not make any oil with the same formula. It is sacred, and you are to consider it sacred. Whoever makes perfume like it and whoever puts it on anyone other than a priest must be cut off from his people” (Exodus 30:22-33). As one shekel equals approximately 9.8 grams, this would mean that the THC of 2.450 kilograms, or close to 5 and half pounds of flowering cannabis tops were extracted into a hin, about 6.5 liters of oil (1.6 gallons). The entheogenic effects of such a solution, even when applied topically, would undoubtedly have been intense. Health Canada has done scientific tests that show transdermal absorption of THC can take place. The skin is the biggest organ of the body, so of course considerably more cannabis is needed to be effective this way, much more than when ingested or smoked.

I talked to Dr. Geiwitz personally and he told me that he felt this offered strong evidence for the potential psychoactive effects of the Holy Oil. It should also be noted, that in relation to the Assyrian Sacred Rites, ingredients required included specifically “quality salves (and particularly) salve of myrrh and salve of cannabis [qunubu]^(*) (Fales, 1983). As well, as noted earlier, it has been suggested that cannabis, under the name azalu, was prepared in an ointment with “hellebore, cannabis and lupine” in order that “god of man and man should be in good rapport.” The sacred character of hemp in biblical times is evident from Exodus 30:22-23, where Moses was instructed by God to anoint the meeting tent and all its furnishings with specially prepared oil, containing hemp. Anointing set sacred things apart from secular. The anointment of sacred objects was an ancient tradition in Israel: holy oil was not to be used for secular purposes.… Above all, the anointing oil was used for the installation rites of all Hebrew kings and priests. (Benet 1975) Only those who had been “dedicated by the anointing oil of … God” (Leviticus 21:12) were permitted to act as priests. In the “holy” state produced by the anointing oil the priests were forbidden to leave the sanctuary precincts (Leviticus 21:12), and the above passage from Exodus, makes quite clear the sacredness of this ointment, the use of which the priests jealously guarded. These rules were made so that other tribal members would not find out the secret behind the priesthood’s new found shamanistic revelations. Or even worse, take it upon themselves to make a similar preparation. Widespread free use of the entheogen, would likely lead to Moses and his fellow Levites losing their authority over their ancient tribal counterparts. Secrets revealed equals power lost, is a rule of thumb that is common to shamans and magicians worldwide, and as shall be seen, the ancient Hebrew shamans guarded their secrets as fiercely as any. As Prof. Luck also noted: “The words spoken by the Lord to Moses … ‘where I shall meet with you,’ should be taken in the strictest literal sense. God will appear to the priest who uses the substance in the proper way. But the sanctions against any", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634243995_cleaned.txt:91:4a7db638cb33", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 2041, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634243995_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634243995", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634243995_cleaned", "chunk_index": 92, "text": "revealed equals power lost, is a rule of thumb that is common to shamans and magicians worldwide, and as shall be seen, the ancient Hebrew shamans guarded their secrets as fiercely as any.

God will appear to the priest who uses the substance in the proper way. But the sanctions against any frivolous, casual use is formidable.… By its nature, an ‘entheogen’ is surrounded by taboos, because it gives access to the deity, and the tremendous power it transmutes must be controlled” (Luck, 1985/2006). Moreover, this Holy Oil was to be used specifically in the Tent of the Meeting, where the Lord would “speak” to Moses. From what can be understood by the descriptions in Exodus, Moses and later High Priests, would cover themselves with this ointment and also place some on the altar of incense before burning it. “Besides its role in anointing, the holy oil of the Hebrews was burned as incense, and its use was reserved to the priestly class” (Russo, 2007). The Exodus account describes Moses as seeking the Lord’s advice, from a pillar of smoke emanating from the altar of incense, in the enclosed chamber of the tent of the meeting. This is reminiscent of the cannabis burning tents of the Scythians and even more so the Assyrian accounts. The burning of specific psychoactive plants in tents may have spread from the Indo-European nomadic cults, the prime example of which are the Scythians … [participating] in the enclosed inhalations of Cannabis vapors … the enclosure in tents or closed rooms is similar to the common practice in modern Cannabis culture referred to as “hot-boxing” (Dannaway, 2009). In Jewish tradition, the pillar of smoke that arose before Moses in the “Tent of the Meeting,” is referred to as the “Shekinah” and is identified as the physical evidence of the Lord’s presence. None of the other Hebrews in the Exodus account either see or hear the Lord, they only know that Moses is talking to the Lord when the smoke is pouring forth from the Tent of the Meeting. As noted earlier, in cases like this, not only were there the psychoactive effects of the smoke, but the smoke provided the partially material basis in which the invoked entity or vision might be viewed. “The magician … burned aromatic substances and anointed his/ her body with perfumed ointments. The whole set-up for an epiphany was there: now all that was necessary was for the deity to appear” (Brashear, 1991). As Professor Luck explained “The smoke itself was the epiphany. The smoke was inhaled by the magician and his client, and the vision came in trance.

The smoke was inhaled by the magician and his client, and the vision came in trance. The smell of psychoactive substances … acts on the human brain in a very quick, very predictable way”: The inhalation of the sacred incense could create a powerful vision of the deity in the priest. Other factors were probably involved too, the smell of the holy oil with which the priest, the altar, and other sacred objects within the temple were anointed, the golden surface of the altar that reflected the shine of lamps…. The shiny surfaces, reflecting the sacral lamps nearby, could help induce trance in the priest as he was breathing smoke. (Luck, 1985/2006) Classical elements of shamanism can be found in the description of Moses’ encounter with God within the smoke filled “Tent of the Meeting.” Even if we do not consider Moses himself as a historical figure, it seems likely that the events described, indicated the ritual activities performed within the Temple grounds. The pouring of holy oil onto the altar of incense to “speak” with the Lord in the pillar of smoke, is in sync with the burning of cannabis and frankincense in the “House of the Lord” at tel Arad. At the time of the prophet Samuel, the use of the shamanic Hebrew anointing oil was extended from just priests, to include Samuel, the description of events that take place after Samuel anoints Israel’s first king, Saul, make clear the psycho-active nature of the ointment used. Samuel “took a flask of oil and poured it on Saul’s head” (1 Samuel 10:1). After the anointing Samuel tells Saul: “The Spirit of the Lord will come upon you in power … and you will be changed into a different person”(1 Samuel 10:6), a statement indicating that the magical (psycho-active) power of the ointment will shortly take effect. Samuel tells Saul that when this happens, he will come across a band of prophets (Nebiim) Coming down from a mountaintop, “with harp, tambourine, flute, and lyre before them prophesying” (1 Samuel 10:5), and that Saul will join them. [After Saul’s anointing] As Samuel foretold, the spirit of Yahweh came mightily upon the new king and he “prophesied among them.” The verb “to prophecy”in this context [nebiim] meant not to foretell the future but to behave ecstatically, to babble incoherently under the influence of the Spirit. This bizarre conduct associated with prophesying is apparent when in a second burst of such activity, Saul stripped off his clothing and lay naked all day and night, causing the people to ask, “Is Saul among the", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634243995_cleaned.txt:93:fa5e495c4765", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 2043, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634243995_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634243995", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634243995_cleaned", "chunk_index": 94, "text": "Samuel foretold, the spirit of Yahweh came mightily upon the new king and he “prophesied among them.” The verb “to prophecy”in this context [nebiim] meant not to foretell the future but to behave ecstatically, to babble incoherently under the influence of the Spirit. This bizarre conduct associated with prophesying is apparent when in a second burst of such activity, Saul stripped off his clothing and lay naked all day and night, causing the people to ask, “Is Saul among the prophets?”(1 Samuel 19:24)(Cole 1959). Note the musical instruments listed; earlier Paul Johnson’s A History of the Jews was quoted: “Prophets practiced ecstasy states and may have used incense and narcotics to produce impressive effects…. The Israelite prophets … acted as mediums. In a state of trance or frenzy they related their divine visions in a sing-song chant, at times a scream. These states could be induced by music.… But the prophets also used, and sometimes abused, incense, narcotics and alcohol…” ( Johnson, 1987). I would suggest that all of these were used in combination, and that we can witness similar effects from cannabis still, in modern music. Cannabis has been a catalyst in a variety of musical genres, Jazz, Greek Rembetika, Rock and Roll, Reggae and notably for our discussion, Hip Hop or rap music. The combination of Cannabis and music can help facilitate a right brain trance. In the altered state produced by cannabis and other drugs, when rhythmic music is played, words can begin to flow out in accordance with the beat and melody. Similarly in ancient temples, the combination of psychoactive incenses and likely other drug infusions, were combined with the set and setting of the temple, the candle light flickered, and gave the statues movement through their shadows, the tambourines and drums, provided a rhythm and melody that the seers swayed to, and eventually verses started to come forth, in the same way, that Rap artists sharing a “blunt” and listening to a beat, might themselves start rhyming, only in the ancient world scenario, this was not recorded as top ten hits, but rather written down by scribes as divinely delivered messages. As psychologist Julian Jaynes has noted, much of the religious texts of the ancient world were written in verse. “Tacitus, for example, visited the oracle of Apollo at Claros about AD 100 and described how the entranced priest listened to his decision-seeking petitioners; he then ‘…swallows a draught of water from a mysterious spring – though ignorant generally of writing and of meters – delivers his response in set verse’” ( Jaynes, 1976). Note in this case as well, something is taken for inspiration. Likewise, the earliest Biblical literature is written in verse, prose was a much later development in Biblical writing. It is interesting to note that David, who would replace Saul and his line as King of Israel, was known as Israel’s", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634243995_cleaned.txt:94:55b9f8f8afab", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 2044, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634243995_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634243995", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634243995_cleaned", "chunk_index": 95, "text": "then ‘…swallows a draught of water from a mysterious spring – though ignorant generally of writing and of meters – delivers his response in set verse’” ( Jaynes, 1976).

It is interesting to note that David, who would replace Saul and his line as King of Israel, was known as Israel’s “singer of songs.” David’s inspiration from God was recognized through his profound ability for poetic prose, and furthers this ability was closely associated with the holy cannabis anointing oil – “The oracle of David son of Jesse, the oracle of the man exalted by the Most High, the man anointed by the God of Jacob, Israel’s singer of songs: ‘The Spirit of the Lord spoke through me: his word was on my tongue’” (2 Samuel 23:1-2). In his brilliant work, The Origin of Consciousness in the Breakdown of the Bicameral Mind (1976) Julian Jaynes explains: “The function of meter in poetry is to drive the electrical activity of the brain, and most certainly to relax the normal emotional inhibitions of both chanter and listener” ( Jaynes 1976). In view of this, and Jayne’s theory of the origins of consciousness, it is not surprising to find that the “first poets were gods,” or more appropriately – the voices of gods; “The godside of our ancient mentality, at least in a certain period of history, usually or perhaps always spoke in verse” ( Jaynes 1976). Indeed, in this grouping we can include the early epics of Greece; the Indian Vedas; and as well the Oracle of Delphi. Further, although the ancient writings of both Mesopotamia and Egypt have left us with little conception of their verbal pronunciations, most can still be seen to have been written in verse. Likewise, the “Hebrew Prophets … when relaying the hallucinated utterance of Yahweh, were all poets, though their scribes did not in every case preserve such speech in verse” ( Jaynes 1976). Or more importantly, the final, uninspired editors certainly did not. Poetry then was divine knowledge … poetry was the sound and tenor of authorization.… The association of rhythmical or repetitively patterned utterances, with supernatural knowledge endures well into the later conscious period. Among the early Arabic people the word for poet was sha’ir, “the knower,” or a person endowed with knowledge by the spirits; his metered speech in recitation was the mark of its divine origin.

The poet and divine seer have a long tradition of association in the ancient world, and several Indo-European languages have a common term for them. Rhyme and alliteration … were always the linguistic province of gods and their prophets ( Jaynes 1976). Traditionally, the rhythmic tics and musical notations in the Torah are the longest and most fundamental parts of the Oral Tradition that settle the Hebrew Torah into a continuous expositional tradition. Mystically, the assumption was always that the music came first, the vowels followed, and only then came the letters and words that made the sounds audible, and made the devotional reading into an ecstatic field of Sharing. This was always the main way the Torah was given over, since the beginning of scrolling. (Personal correspondence with Needelman-Ruiz, 2022) Jaynes comments further that in the ancient world, poetry was song, and the rhythmic patterning of music facilitates activity in the right side of the brain, which delivers it back out as “measured-verse” or “dactylic hexameters.” “Speech … is a function of the left cerebral hemisphere. But song … is primarily a function of the right cerebral hemisphere…[A] buildup of excitation in those areas on the right hemisphere serving instrumental music should spread to those adjacent serving divine auditory hallucinations – or vice versa … hence this close association between instrumental music and poetry, and both with the voices of the gods” ( Jaynes 1976). It is in the right side of the brain that Jaynes sees the “god-side” of man, and his research has led him to believe that this side of man’s brain, in some miraculous way, preceded the left half into consciousness and this is how all the “highly patterned legend, which so clearly can be taken as a metaphor of the huge transilience towards consciousness” ( Jaynes 1976), was written by seemingly unconscious and primitive men. Jaynes’ theory about music, poetry and consciousness establishes itself by the fact that music is prevalent in shamanistic ceremonies worldwide,(even surviving down into the traditional music of modern religious ceremony, but in this case it is merely as the reciting of a left hemispheric memory alone, rather than a tool for shamanistic revelation). “The invention of music may have been as a neural excitant to the hallucinations of gods for decision-making in the absence of consciousness” ( Jaynes 1976). Considering the numerous references to musical instruments of many kinds, “lyres, tambourines, sistrums and cymbals,” etc., as well as their association with the naabi, in the books of Samuel, and that David himself was a lyre playing poet, Jaynes’ theories are of the utmost relevance.

In the more reflective time of King David, through the “enthusiasm” initiated by the entheogenic anointing oil and music, David’s “genius” came forth and his “muse” gave him the “spirit” to speak on behalf of a Lord. This would come to be a standard practice, as the Prophet Amos recorded centuries later: In the Biblical references to the dancing and singing prophets that Saul encounters after being anointed, one is clearly reminded of the ecstatic worshipers of the Thracian-Greek god Dionysus, and his lyre playing hero-counterpart Orpheus. Indeed, we find that, “Prophetic activity associated with music … dancing and leaping was evidently a religious phenomenon of Canaanite origin.… Historical and archaeological studies of Asia Minor and Syria have shown that orgiastic cults of this type flourished in ancient times. The devotees of Bacchus, of Dionysus, of Syrian Baals, participated in wild rites involving the use of fermented beverages and frequently culminating in the letting of blood and/or sexual activity” (Cole 1959). One of Dionysus’ alternative names was Adonis, which is derived from the Semitic Adonai, the Lord, a title which is often applied to Yahweh. Likewise, in the Book of Samuel, the Hebrew term, for “to make nabi” (prophet), corresponds in meaning to the Greek term “to be bachant,” (In reference to another of Dionysus’ names, Bacchus) a connection made on the basis of the ecstatic and frenzied nature of the prophets from both cults ( Jeanmaire 1951). In the centuries just prior to Christ, Dionysus held a cult center in Jerusalem, as well as in most of the other major cities in the ancient middle east, but the God’s influence on the developing Hebrew cult likely goes back to much earlier times. This is a connection that we shall return to later in relation to infused wines amongst the ancient Hebrews in Chapter 13. Saul must have been either temporarily, mentally disabled by the psychedelic experience of his anointing and the time spent amongst the ecstatic nabi, or reluctant to fulfill his appointment as the new king – for when the tribes of Israel are gathered to be shown their new leader, Saul is nowhere to be found. This causes Samuel to consult the Lord on Saul’s whereabouts, and the Lord reveals that Saul, “has hidden himself among the baggage” (1 Samuel 10:22).

However the effects seem much more intense that one could expect from just cannabis, and one is left to wonder if perhaps other ingredients, such as mandrake, which appears with kaneh in the next verses we shall look at regarding cannabis, in Solomon’s Song of Songs. Those who see an indication of virility in these references, may not be too far off, and it may well have been intentional. Throughout the ancient world the use of anointing oils seems to have been often intertwined with a fertility ritual known as the Sacred Marriage, or Hieros Gamos. Regardless of this controversial suggestion, through the rite of anointing, the king and his kingdom believed they attained the assurance of the continued fecundity of the land. A similar relationship is inferred from Solomon’s coronation and anointing. In the Psalms we read of the King’s role as the bestower of fertility through the rite of the Sacred Marriage: “Endow your king with justice, O God.… He will endure as long as the sun.… He will be like … showers watering the earth.… Let corn abound throughout the land; on the tops of the hills may it sway. Let its fruit flourish like Lebanon; let it thrive like the grass of the field. May his name endure forever” (Psalm 72:1-17). The Sacred Marriage was a pagan ritual which held paramount importance in the ancient world, and through the evidence of the Songs and Solomon’s own reign, we will see that it was apparently practiced in the Temple of Jerusalem itself. Moreover, that the sexual symbolism contained within it, is much more direct and obvious than the above verses. he next reference to kaneh occurs in Song of Songs 4:14, a love poem, and in this author’s opinion the most beautiful piece of prose in the Bible. Tradition places King Solomon himself as its author. This attribution in the Biblical narrative places Solomon as a poet king, as was his father David before him (listed as author of 73 Psalms in the titles of the Psalms).

At this point in the Biblical narrative, the ancient Hebrews have successfully subdued the Canaanites, whose lands they conquered, and have stabilized their borders. They hold command and control of the overland trade routes putting them in a position where they can begin to amass vast wealth. The glory days of the Israelites were inaugurated, and although short-lived, they left an indelible mark upon the Hebrew people which has lasted down to the present, as well as having had a profound shaping influence upon the course of later world history. According to Kings, as the Lord doesn’t have a temple of his own, the Israelites were making offerings on the high places, and in doing this they were committing a grave sin. In light of this it is curious to note that it is here on the high place of Gibeah that Yahweh first appears to Solomon while he is making one of these supposedly improper sacrifices. (The same high place upon which Saul was anointed King over Israel). The very high places which are here, apparently, legitimate places of worship, are to be a major bone of contention to the later kings of the divided kingdom of Northern Israel and Southern Judah, but obviously at this period in history there wasn’t anything unlawful about them; until much later, when the Yahwhist instilled their god, as the one god alone to be worshiped. Archaeological evidence attests to the polytheistic nature of the area in this time period, as already noted. The building of Israel’s first temple is something that clearly establishes Solomon above all other Hebrew Kings. The temple is constructed using mostly foreign expertise imported from the neighboring city of Tyre. It is a lavish production and no expense is spared. Like most of the great buildings of the ancient world, Solomon’s Temple was also said to have been built out of the sweat of forced labor. All “the people left from the Amorites, Hittites, Perizittes Hivites and Jebusites … that is their descendents living in the land, whom the Israelites could not exterminate – these Solomon conscripted for his slave labor force” (1 Kings 9:21). Imitating the kingdoms around him, Solomon not only orders the new Temple of Yahweh built by his massive slave force, but his own palace, the supporting terraces, as well as walls around the cities of Jerusalem, Hazor, Megiddo and Gezer.

The building of the Temple marks the completion of the Israelites transition from their nomadic shepherding roots. The narrative records that Solomon had built the temple for Yahweh at the Lord’s request. However, it is here in the temple that the idolatrous worship so despised by the later editors of the Hebrew Bible expresses its strongest relationship with the Jewish people. As Professor Bernhard Anderson explains in Understanding the Old Testament: “The Temple – designed by Phoenician (that is Canaanite) architects – represented the invasion of Canaanite culture right into the center of Israel’s life and worship. Any conservative Israelite who cherished the faith of his fathers must have been shocked by Solomon’s bold imitation of foreign way” (Anderson 1975). Considering the obviously pagan fertility rites being practiced in the Temple, it is interesting to note that the site picked for its construction was the same threshing floor purchased by David near the end of his reign (2 Chronicles 3:1). Some have seen the purchasing of a threshing floor for the building of the temple, as evidence that the promotion of agricultural fertility was closely associated with the worship of Yahweh, showing that at the time of David, Yahweh was a Semitic Tammuz or Baal and his proper worship was closely affiliated with the fertility of both the land and king. Throughout the ancient world, kings acted as a sort of human counterpart of the fertility god, and it seems likely a variety of this relationship existed amongst the Hebrews. Dr. Hugh Schonfield has suggested that there was a connection between the name of David, and that of Dad, (also Adad, Dod), the counterpart of Tammuz in Palestine. David was portrayed as a shepherd, as was Tammuz, and there “was a shrine of Adonis-Tammuz in David’s city of Bethlehem (the place of Bread)” (Schonfield 1966). With David’s purchase of a threshing-floor in order to build an Altar for the Lord (2 Samuel 24 18-25; I Chronicles 21 22-30) along with sacrifices during the harvest and in order to restore waning fertility in both David and the Land (2 Samuel 21:9),2 Yahweh could be seen as a Semitic Tammuz – as his proper worship was closely affiliated with the fertility of both the land and king. The Israelites kept the inner sanctuary of the temple, the “Holy of Holies,” a secret from outsiders. Only the high priests and kings could cross its threshold.", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634243995_cleaned.txt:100:2b2437d3dca9", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 2050, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634243995_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634243995", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634243995_cleaned", "chunk_index": 101, "text": "24 18-25; I Chronicles 21 22-30) along with sacrifices during the harvest and in order to restore waning fertility in both David and the Land (2 Samuel 21:9),2 Yahweh could be seen as a Semitic Tammuz – as his proper worship was closely affiliated with the fertility of both the land and king. The Israelites kept the inner sanctuary of the temple, the “Holy of Holies,” a secret from outsiders. Only the high priests and kings could cross its threshold. The text describes in great detail the construction and the layout of this inner sanctuary and we learn that within the temple of Solomon there was, harboring over the ark of the covenant, two cherubim. They are described in detail from their size to their positioning, and were made all in one piece of beaten gold facing each other with wings outstretched over the ark, their wing-tips touching. Likewise in the desert tabernacle, the Tent of the Meeting, the statues of the cherubim are described as being present. Like the anomaly of the Brazen Serpent made by Moses, the Lord’s order to make the cherubim is a very surprising command coming from the same jealous god who was recorded as commanding that “You shall not make for yourself an idol in the form of anything in heaven above or on earth beneath or in the waters below. You shall not bow down to them or worship them…” (Exodus 20:4-5). The cherubim bring to mind the Eden mythology, as they were placed to guard the way of the Tree of Life and entrance to Eden. Interestingly other contents of Solomon’s Temple also “imitate the expulsion from Eden” (Bloom 1990). Apparently, from the time of Moses, to that of the later reformer Hezekiah, the Bronze serpent Moses made, and that “the Israelites had been burning incense to” (2 Kings 18:4), was present within the confines of the Temple. As well, as noted, the Hebrew Bible contains numerous references to the image of the Mother Goddess Asherah, (the proto-type of the later mortalized Eve – “Mother of All Living”), being contained within the confines of the Temple throughout most of the Hebraic monarchic period. Considering the supposedly monotheistic nature of Judaic worship, these contents would seem rather curious. This is particularly true of the Biblical cherubim, who were depicted as both male and female. Although the descriptions given of the first Temple cherubim is vague, by the time of the building of the Second Temple, the two brazen idols were clearly depicted in a sexual embrace – ritual statuary that was only revealed to the initiated, and believed to depict the deepest secrets of the Hebraic faith.3 The ancient Jewish Philosopher Philo (20 BCE-50 CE) felt that the cherubim represented the male and female aspects of God, (an idea that would profoundly influence the later development of the Kabbalah).

In light of Philo’s speculation, it is interesting to note the comments of Biblical scholar, Samuel Terrien, who wrote that the Temple cherubim “may have been … related both to the … Magna Mater [the Great Mother] and to the ritual of cultic male prostitution” (Terrien, 1970). Like the sexual symbolism of the cherubim indicating Hebraic ties to the fertility cults of the ancient Near East, we find similar cultic imagery associated with one of the most sacred symbols of the Hebrew Religion, the Ark of the Covenant, Hugo Gressman (1920) suggested that originally there must have been two images in the Ark, one representing Yahweh and the other his wife Anatyahu or Astarte, although here Asherah seems much more likely for reasons already discussed, but based on archaeological evidence that was not known in Gressman’s time. Similarly Julian Morgenstien (1940) conjectured that the two sacred stones in the Ark originally “represented Yahweh and, in all likelihood, His female companion.” Other sources see that the ark itself represented the divine female genitalia, which held the phallic stone representative of Yahweh, in a similar manner to the yonic images which act as stands for upright lingams in India (Sellon 1865). These comments clearly bring to mind the phallic and yonic images that were also used in the worship of Baal and Asherah or Anath, and are of further relevance when we consider that amongst the sins of King Solomon (who is supposedly the wisest of men) was the transgression of worshiping foreign Gods, and especially Goddesses. “When Solomon grew old his wives swayed his heart to other gods; and his heart was not wholly with Yahweh his God as his father David’s had been. Solomon became a follower of Ashtoreth, the goddess of the Sidonians…” (I Kings XI: 4-5). In reference to Solomon’s worship of the Goddess, Harry Thomas Frank notes in An Archaeological Companion to the Bible that “Asherah” who is “seemingly interchangeable with Ashtaroth in, the Hebrew Scriptures, is by far the most widely known fertility goddess in the Old Testament” (Frank, 1972). In light of this it is not so surprising to find that recent scholarship has suggested Solomon’s Song of Songs, considered by many to be the most beautiful piece of poetry in the whole Hebrew Bible, was originally derived from Semitic hymns in honor of the sacred marriage ritual between a God and Goddess.

In light of this it is not so surprising to find that recent scholarship has suggested Solomon’s Song of Songs, considered by many to be the most beautiful piece of poetry in the whole Hebrew Bible, was originally derived from Semitic hymns in honor of the sacred marriage ritual between a God and Goddess. The Sacred Marriage, also known as the Hieros Gamos, had already existed for millennia before the time of Solomon, under numerous variations throughout the ancient world. “Kings and queens, pharaonic couples (sometimes brother and sister), or priest and priestess – such personages would join in sexual union once a year in order to ensure general fertility and the well-being of ‘their’ people” (Camphausen 1991). The Song of Songs is often portrayed as the pious song of the love of a people for their god, when in actuality it testifies to the practice of erotic fertility rites amongst the Hebrews. It is generally believed that the Songs were composed from a mosaic of cultic liturgies and hymns from ancient Palestine which were artificially synthesized into a single narrative and placed with the authorship of Solomon. The text itself is called a “ritual song” (Zarir) at 2:12, and this same word is used to describe the fertility rite liturgies of Tammuz and Ishtar. Fertility cults of the Near East, including ancient Palestine, involved the ritual courtship and consummation of a goddess with a god to insure fertility. An Erotic terracotta plaque from the Old Babylonian Period (c. 1830 BC) from the Archaeology Wing in the Israel Museum at Jerusalem. This sort of imagery has often been interpreted as evidence of the Hieros Gamos, or Sacred Marriage ritual in which the king would take on the role of Tammuz and engage in sexual intercourse with the priestess of Inanna/Ishtar. (Image: Yoav Dothan, Public Domain). were sung in hopes of inspiring the deities to make love, ensuring the fertility of the land and herds. There are abundant clues that the Songs were stitched together from earlier fertility rite hymns. The title “beloved” (5:9) was that applied to Dad aka Tammuz the god who was partnered with Ishtar. Likewise, the title “Shepard King” was that of fertility god Tammuz. The view that the Song of Songs derives from pagan fertility worship was developed in the present century and, in spite of resistance, has continued to gain ground with the accelerating recovery and progress in interpretation of documents of religious literature of the civilizations of the near East, especially Mesopotamia, and more recently the Ugaritic mythological and religious texts.

Ebeling (1923)(Pope 1977). The ancients worshiped the Goddess as a nude female image, the earth they lived on and the nature around them. The fertile rays of the sun on the earth, was thought of as God’s fertilization of the Great Mother-Earth, as were showers of rain, and morning dew. Remnants of this belief can be found in the etymological origins of certain Hebrew words. The word zirmah, which means “a gushing of fluid (semen):–issue” (Strong 1979) besides having similarities to the word for “seed” of man, animal and vegetation, zera, is also directly related to the Hebrew word zerem, meaning “flood … shower, storm” (Strong 1979). Despite the supposed monotheistic nature of the Hebrew Bible, Solomon’s Song, is full of both erotic and vegetative imagery, and this testifies to the pagan origins of the poem attributed to the wisest of the Biblical patriarchs. As the feminist mythologist Barbra Walker has written: “The fragment of love-liturgy now called Solomon’s Song has been an embarrassment to theologians … the 18th century scholar Herder was persecuted and hounded from one pastorate to another for daring to suggest that Solomon’s love poem should be accepted at face value, as a piece of erotica” (Walker 1983): When the metaphors of this poem are unraveled, they prove to be … frankly sexual. The hortus conclusus or “enclosed garden” is the internal genitalia of the virgin bride, where her spouse “enters paradise” – from Hebrew pardes, “garden.” Solomon says, “A garden enclosed is my sister, my spouse; a spring shut up, a fountain sealed.” He proposes to unseal her, unlock her door, and “drink of spiced wine of the juice of the pomegranate” (Song of Solomon 8:2).This metaphor is explained by the contemporary image of the pomegranate, rimmon, as a female-genital symbol. Spiced wine meant the secretion of the Goddess… Solomon’s bride said invitingly, “Let my beloved come into his garden, and eat his pleasant fruits.” Solomon answered, “Open to me, my sister, my love, my dove, my undefiled: for my head is filled with dew, and my locks with the drops of the night.

I have put off my garment; how shall I put it on?” The king’s dew filled “head” was the common symbol of the penis, in royal wedding hymns of Sumer and Akkad. A king’s union with the Goddess Inanna, Queen of the Universe, was so described: “The king goes with head lifted to the holy lap, he goes with lifted head to the holy lap of Inanna.” Every king’s divine bride was Inanna “the queen, the vulva of heaven and earth” (Walker 1983). Perhaps the most blatant of all the ancient fertility songs, and highly descriptive of the correlation between sex and fertility in the minds of the ancient worshipers, is the hymn Plow My Vulva; “My vulva is a well-watered field – Who will plow it?” The answer comes; “O Lordly Lady, the king will plow it for you, Dumuzi, the king, will plow it for you.” Even more explicit is the description given in the following Sumerian hymn celebrating the union between Innana and Dumuzi (Tammuz): He caressed my loins with his fair hands, The shepherd Dumuzi poured milk and cream into me, He stroked my pubic hair, He irrigated my womb. He laid his hands upon my holy vulva, He nourished my black boat with his cream, He ripened my narrow boat with his milk, He caressed me on the bed. Now I’ll caress my priest on that bed, I’ll make love to the faithful shepherd Dumuzi. The reference to hand in the above passage likely refers symbolically to another appendage on the body of man. “The use of … ‘hand’ as a euphemism for phallus was recognized in the last century by some commentators on Isaiah 57:8-10 where the term is twice used in that sense.… Whether the word ‘hand’ in the present passage refers to the membrum virile depends on the nature of the hole into which it is inserted” (Pope 1977). Marvin Pope explains: “It is no accident that tombstones and memorial stelae are sometimes distinctly phallic in form … and the term yad, ‘hand’, in Ugaritic and Hebrew is applied to the phallus and in Hebrew to a memorial stela (I Sam 15:12; II Sam 18:18; Isa 56:5)”(Pope 1977).

Since through sexuality their own lines continued, so through imitative magic and the proper worship of the God and Goddess, fertility was transferred to nature each spring and the fecundity of both their lines and the land was ensured. In their orgiastic excess in the fields and funerary grounds, the ancient practitioners believed their erotic worship bought Life’s continuing victory over Death. “It is no accident that tombstones and memorial stelae are sometimes distinctly phallic in form” (Pope 1977). Riane Eisler has noted of such rites: For if plants could be born again and again from the earth (the womb of vegetation) one could believe, even though it was not given to humans to witness that process, that the Goddess – who recycled days and nights, barley and wheat, and spring and fall – would also recycle human life. And one could also believe that through erotic rites of alignment with the mysterious power of sex through which the Goddess performed her miraculous work of birth and rebirth, we humans could not only find protection and solace in our inevitable pain, sorrow and death but also augment our chances, generation after generation, for a joyful and bountiful life (Eisler 1995). Similar erotic imagery is repeated in verse 7 of Solomon’s Song, in which the concept of human fertility in the Love drama was closely intertwined with the fertility of the land around them – the lush growth of vegetation is clothed and combined with the physical attributes of human sexuality. A beautiful celebration of Life and Love in all respects: Leap, leap, O Shulamite! leap, leap, and let us gaze on you… Your curvy thighs like ornaments Crafted by artists’ hands. Your vulva a rounded crater; May it never lack punch! Your belly a mound of wheat Hedged with lotuses… Let your breasts be like grape clusters, The scent of your vulva like apples, Your palate like the best wine Flowing (for my love) smoothly… Come, my love, Let us hie to the fields, Let us lie in the cypress, Let us get to the vineyards. We will see if the vine sprouts, If the blossoms bud… There will I give you my love…5 The Song of Songs, like the Tammuz-Ishtar hymns from which it derived, is testimony to the linking of ritualized human sexual behavior and the fertility of the land.

The very roots of this belief system can be seen in Song of Songs 8:6, “For Love is strong as Death.” In his brilliant commentary on the Songs, Pope suggests that the Songs, and the fertility rite from which they were derived, may originally have been connected with funerary feasts “which in the Near East were love feasts celebrated with wine, women and song” (Pope 1977). Apparently, these wakes would often become drunken orgies and as the mourners grief turned to ecstasy, love overcame death as the orgiastic excess of the participants ensured both the continued fecundity of the land, as well as their own lines. In tune with this are the revelries of Baal Peor, which are clearly defined as funeral feasts in Psalms 106:28: “They yoked themselves to Baal Peor, And ate the sacrifices of the dead.… Ugaritic tablets also detail the events of the marzeah feast, a repast in which … dead kings were summoned to wine and dine with the living…” (Noegel & Wheeler, 2010). These sacrifices of the dead characterized by sacral sexual intercourse are identified by the rabbis as marzehim.… Midrashic commentaries related the marzeah to the Mayumas festival … a celebration which featured wife swapping. Mayumas festivals were observed along the Mediterranean … with such licentiousness that the Roman rulers felt constrained to ban them. Rabbi Hanan apparently alluded to such rites in his comment that “it was done in the cities of the sea what was done in the generation of the flood.” … From the various strands of evidence, we gather that the marzeah was a religious institution which included families and owned houses for meetings and vineyards for supply of wine, that the groups met periodically to celebrate seven-day feasts with rich food and drink and sometimes with sexual orgies (Pope 1977). It is believed that the word marzeah means to unite, or possibly a cultic union. In relation to this word and the Mayumas festival to which it was so closely connected, it is interesting to note the similarity to the Hindu Tantric term maithuna – sexual union (the last of the sacred five M’s of the Left handed path) which take place in ceremonies similar to those described above. “The Tantric tradition of India, especially the left handed erotic rites, are of particular interest for the appreciation of … the parallels alleged to have persisted in Western funeral feasts into Christian times” (Pope 1977). Interestingly, bhanga, a cannabis beverage, has been used in this Tantric ritual since ancient times.

These similarities are so profound, that some scholars believe they could in fact indicate a similar origin for both the Tantric and Biblical hymns. As Raphael Patai has also noted “Unquestionably, the verse ‘I am black and beautiful, O daughters of Jerusalem’ (Songs 1:5) is strongly reminiscent of certain Hindu Kali, who is generally depicted with a girdle of human arms and a necklace of skulls, could be seen as the Hindu counterpart of the ferocious and sensuous Canaanite goddess, Anath, described in the Canaanite Baal Epic with “attached heads to her back, Girded hands to her waist.” Referring to the similarities between the mythology of Anath and “the mythology and iconography of the Indian goddess Durga [Kali],” Mircea Eliade wrote that “Carnage and cannibalism are characteristic features of archaic fertility goddesses. From this point of view, the myth of Anath can be classed among the elements common to the ancient agricultural civilization that extended from the Eastern Mediterranean to the plain of the Ganges” (Eliade 1978). In relation to the drug induced orgiastic rites that we have attributed to the ancient Canaanite fertility cult, it is interesting to again note that cannabis was likely used before recorded history by Tantric cults in complicated sex rites dedicated to Kali. In line with the orgiastic Baal and Asherahworship which was said to have taken place on “the high places,” Shiva is especially revered on mountain tops, and his “feminine aspect [Parvati] is the ‘Lady of the Mountain’”(Danielou 1992). Shiva’s popular title as Bh - upati, “Lord of the Earth,” is comparable to Baal’s epithet of Beelzebul, “Lord of the Land,” and the Hindu deity can be seen as an Indian form of Baal, although any original connections between the two gods are lost in the shadowy time of prehistory. Alaine Danielou, an expert on Shaivism, has noted that: “The struggle of the new Hebrew monotheism against the Baal cult reflects the deep penetration of Shivaite concepts in the Semetic world” (Danielou 1992). Shiva’s strong connections with hemp as an agricultural crop are clearly demonstrated in his ancient mythology involving the plant as well as the strict observances which his devotees still pay when sowing", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634243995_cleaned.txt:108:337ef203fd0d", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 2058, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634243995_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634243995", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634243995_cleaned", "chunk_index": 109, "text": "any original connections between the two gods are lost in the shadowy time of prehistory.

Shiva’s strong connections with hemp as an agricultural crop are clearly demonstrated in his ancient mythology involving the plant as well as the strict observances which his devotees still pay when sowing and harvesting the sacred crop. Shiva is the “Lord of Bhang.” Reminiscent of the phallic Baal stones referred to in Biblical passages, is Shiva’s lingam, represented by an oblong stone, and which up until modern times has been consecrated by pouring bhang over it, a religious sacrifice of unknowable antiquity. The Indian ritual use of hemp obviously developed out of similar, if not identical fertility rites as those practiced in Canaan and throughout the Mediterranean cultural complex. Like their Near Eastern counterparts, the Tantric worshipers of Kali and her consort Shiva are known to practice their Tantric sex ceremonies in graveyards, (often involving the initiatory cannabis drink ‘bhang’). Kali’s worship can be traced back before recorded history; the similarities between her and ancient Mesopotamian Goddesses of Love and War, like Ishtar and Anath, indicate that they may all have evolved out of a singular preceding archetypal goddess. Such cultural connections would also account for the noted and profound similarities between the Near Eastern terms for cannabis, kaneh and the earliest Sanskrit name canna, as well as the similar cultic use. “In India it is still possible to relive and understand the rites and beliefs of the … Middle East in ancient times” (Danielou 1992). By the time of Solomon, the earlier pagan fertility rites and their massive orgies, such as those described at Baal Peor (Numbers 25), became slightly more refined and the sexual congress may have been more focused on the King and the High Priestess, although there were still likely some occasions that this erotic activity broke out into bouts of ritual promiscuity among the people. In the Sacred Marriage, the king became the god Tammuz and was “married: to the Goddess Inannawhose part was enacted by a priestess. It would seem from the references to David’s last concubine, the Shulamite, in the Songs, along with Solomon’s brother Adonijah’s attempt to gain her as his wife (1 Kings 2), that the Shulamite was a high priestess of some sort and she played the goddess in the Hebraic counterpart of the ritual fertility drama. As early as 1906 Wilhelm Erbt regarded the Songs as a collection of spring songs which originated in Canaan and described the love of the sun god Tammuz, also known as Shekem, and his consort the moon goddess Ishtar, under the feminine form of the name Shelem.

As early as 1906 Wilhelm Erbt regarded the Songs as a collection of spring songs which originated in Canaan and described the love of the sun god Tammuz, also known as Shekem, and his consort the moon goddess Ishtar, under the feminine form of the name Shelem. This line of thought was followed by T.J. Meek, who in 1924 proposed that the name Solomon is derived from the divine name Shelem, equated with Tammuz, and the “Shulamite” an epithet of Ishtar in Jerusalem. In 1963 W.F. Albright also saw the references to the Shulamite as indications that the Hebraic Sacred Marriage was derived directly from the Canaanite fertility cult. Although in Albright’s view Solomon and his bride appeared as the Canaanite counterparts of Tammuz and Ishtar; i.e.- Baal and his sister-lover Anath, (the daughter of Ashera, also known as the Virgin). “We may safely suppose that the Canaanite prototype of Shulamanitu-Shulammith is the goddess Anath, whose sanguinary play is so vividly portrayed in the Anath episode of the Baal Epic” (Albright 1963). Baal, was another figure with pivotal influence on the development of Yahweh’s characteristics, despite the hostility that existed between their cults in the Hebrew Bible narrative. Amongst the developing god Yahweh’s assumption of many of the aspects of his predecessor Baal, may have been the Jewish god’s romantic association with Anath. Although Asherah was indicated as Yahweh’s wife in inscriptions from the 10th to 8th century BCE, in later times in Egypt at least, Anath was seen as coupled with Yahweh. “In the fifth century B.C. a Jewish colony in Elephantine, Egypt, did apparently believe that Yahweh had a partner Anath” (Anderson 1975). As John Day explained of this situation in his essay “Asherah in the Hebrew Bible and Northwest Semitic Literature”: “It is understandable that in certain circles Yahweh should have Asherah as a consort, since Asherah was originally El’s consort and we know that El and Yahweh were equated in ancient Israel. Similarly, the fact that Yahweh has Anat as a consort at Elephantine presumably goes back to an equation of Yahweh with Baal, since Anat was Baal’s consort originally” (Day, 1986). Also important to note here is that polytheism was completely still in play amongst the Jewish community at Elephantine in the 4th century BCE, and they were in correspondence with high officials in Jerusalem, who seemed to have no issues with the polytheism there. The Elephantine papyri pre-date all extant manuscripts of the Hebrew Bible, and thus give scholars a very important glimpse at how Judaism was practiced in Egypt, and likely other areas during the fifth century BCE. The name “Anath” appears infrequently in the Biblical narrative, occurring only in place names such as Beth-Anath, and Anathoth (", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634243995_cleaned.txt:110:61fd6f670519", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 2060, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634243995_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634243995", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634243995_cleaned", "chunk_index": 111, "text": "in the 4th century BCE, and they were in correspondence with high officials in Jerusalem, who seemed to have no issues with the polytheism there.

The name “Anath” appears infrequently in the Biblical narrative, occurring only in place names such as Beth-Anath, and Anathoth ( Joshua 15:59; 19:38; Judges 1:33; Joshua 21:18; 1 Kings 2:26; Isaiah 10:30; Jeremiah 1:1) and the personal names Shamgar ben Anath (son of Anath) ( Judges 3:31; 5:6), Anthothijah (1 Chronicles 8:24), and Anathoth (1 Chronicles 7:8; Nehemiah 10:19). When compared to the frequent references to Asherah in the Bible, along with the considerable archaeological evidence for both Asherah’s worship and inscriptions coupling her with Yahweh in the time period we are dealing with that has accumulated since Albright’s reference, this would make Asherah a much more likely candidate for the bride in the Songs. However, it is also important to keep in mind, we are dealing with polytheism here, and all sorts of Gods and Goddesses were part of the pantheon and played a part in the ritual life of the people, and in this respect the role of Anath in the Canaanite cosmology, and her relationship with her brother/lover Baal, can not be ruled out as a source of inspiration for the Biblical Love poem. The Mesopotamian version of the Sacred Marriage is believed to have taken place in a chamber at the top of the huge temple complex in which was kept only a bed. The legs of the bed were animal shaped, either lions claws or bull’s hooves, further linking the ritual that was to take place to the fecundity of the land and animals around them. On the evening of the Sacred Marriage the king as Tammuz went into a priestess who played the Goddess Inanna and on the hallowed bed, “Sexual intercourse between the incarnate god and goddess then took part in the sacred chamber of the temple” (Saggs 1962). “The core of the ritual was an act of sexual congress between king and goddess-figure.… The sexual union was intended to promote the fertility of the land” (Frymer-Kensky 1992). As we have seen, the temple of Inanna in Uruk, Eanna, was recorded to have received copious amounts of qunnabu (cannabis). The idea that here as well, we might find indications of the ritual use of cannabis in the Sacred Marriage, does seem probable. In The First Great Powers: Babylon and Assyria (2019) Arthur Cotterell explains “In a temple set within a beautiful garden at Uruk the ruler impersonated Dumuzi, an early king and husband of Inanna, while the high priestess took on the role of the goddess herself.

One text has the king of Uruk boast how he ‘lay on the splendid bed of Inanna, strewn with pure plants.… The day did not dawn, the night did not pass. For fifteen hours I lay with Inanna’” (Cotterell, 2019). Assyriologist Erica Reiner believed the “Bed of Ishtar” (Inanna) indicated an aphrodisiac plant and compared it to the aromatic of Ishara, qunnabu, “cannabis,”noting that this calls to mind the plant named “ki.na Istar, in Akkadian suhsi Istar, or majal Istar, both meaning bed of Istar” (Reiner, 1995). The Akkadian ki.na here holding a phonetic similarity to the Indo-European root kanna. Rediscovered Mesopotamian hymns and songs also give ample evidence that the union between the king and the goddess-figure was sexual. In the Shulgi hymn we read that “by his fair hands my loins were pressed … he [ruffled] the hair of my lap” and “he laid his hands on my pure vulva.” And again in the Iddin-Dagan hymn, “When holy Inanna has stretched out on the bed.… She makes love to him [the king] on her bed.” It is obvious from the closing words of the Song of Songs, that an identical sexual motif and act as that described in the Mesopotamian Sacred Marriage hymns, lay at the core of the ancient ritual drama that it was composed for: The ritual of the Sacred Marriage in Mesopotamia has been dated as far back as the fourth millennium B.C. Throughout the Fertile Crescent the Great Mother and her counterpart were worshiped in sexual rites in the temples and high places. In T.J. Meek’s view, from its beginnings the Song of Songs was a religious composition that was originally connected to the cult of Tammuzand Astarte, rather than the followers of Yahweh. However, because of its popularity, it had been adapted over time to become less offensive, and harmonized with Yahweh’s cultus: Even a casual perusal of the … [Tammuz-Ishtar] hymns … must convince the most skeptical … that the similarity between them and the songs in the book of Canticles [another name for the Song of Songs] is so close that both belong together. The structure of the songs is the same (two lovers representing god and goddess wooing each other and alternating in the praise of each other’s charms); the general theme is the same (love); many of the phrases are quite identical; the figures are introduced in similar fashion; the lines breath the same delight", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634243995_cleaned.txt:112:88f70a857567", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 2062, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634243995_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634243995", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634243995_cleaned", "chunk_index": 113, "text": "that the similarity between them and the songs in the book of Canticles [another name for the Song of Songs] is so close that both belong together.

Both are liturgies of the fertility cult. The only difference is that one group has come from Babylonia and the other from Palestine, where numerous influences tended to obscure and efface its original character (Meek 1924). Later Hebrew Bible writings condemn the worshipers of Tammuz, indicating the popularity of the cult in the ancient world and even among the Israelites. The vegetation god Tammuz, personified the spring sun believed to die and descend to Hades each winter and with the aid of his mourning worshipers, annually made to return to life each spring, when his followers held a celebration and burned incense proclaiming “On the day which Tammuz rises up, when the flute of lapis lazuli and the ring of carnelian rise up with him, when male and female mourners rise up with him, may the dead also rise and inhale the incense” (Ringgren 1973). A similar seasonal descentmythology concerning Baal and Anath has also been noted, and this also was reenacted in a ritual drama. Comparative to the “incense” in the Tammuz hymn, are the “weeds” in an ancient poem about Baal; “Be it told to Puissant Baal: Summon weeds into thy house, Herbs into the midst of thy palace.… Puissant Baal rejoice. He summoned weeds into the house, Herbs into the midst of his palace” (Pritchard 1958). Patai, pointed out that the title “Rider of Clouds,” an epithet of Yahweh, was originally attributed to Baal, in both cases the epithet was associated with the copious incense used in their worship. The incense and plant imagery of rebirth from the Baal and Tammuz hymns described above, appears to be repeated much later in Isaiah 26:19; “your dead will live; their bodies will rise. You who dwell in the dust, wake up and shout for joy. Your dew is the dew of herbs; the earth will give birth to her dead.” In this passage, we not only see the potency of the Lord’s dew, but also its association with herbs, here owrah, a word meaning “bright-plant,” and possibly referring to an entheogen. This term is incorporated into the tree like sacred candle stick, the menorah. The association of a potent “herb” with heavenly “dew,” is one that is also evident in the Sacred Marriage, and the Song of Songs.

The association of a potent “herb” with heavenly “dew,” is one that is also evident in the Sacred Marriage, and the Song of Songs. In relation to the fertility aspect of Baaland the references to incense it is of interest to note that the Songs tells us that Solomon had a vineyard in Baal Hamon (8:11). In no other place in the Bible does this place-name occur. Professor Helmer Ringgren reports that a Ba’al Hamano was worshiped in Carthage, Phoenicia and Palmyra and “the name has been interpreted as ‘the lord of the altar of incense’ … In Latin inscriptions he is called frugifer, ‘the fruit-bearer,’ and deus frugum, ‘the god of fruits,’ which points in the direction of a vegetation god” (Ringgren 1973). In the cases of both Tammuz and Baal, the burning of the incense and herbs referred to, revolves around the rebirth of the God and relates to the fertility rites of the Spring festival, which involved the ritual dramatization of the Sacred Marriage. In the time of Solomon it is indicated that the Hebrew kings took on a similar role to that of the other Near Eastern kings who played the part of the Baal or Tammuz, so it is not at all surprising to find references to the burning of incense being associated with both Solomon and the Sacred Marriage in the Songs: The German researcher Hartmut Schmokel, like other scholars, suggested that in the Song of Songs, a syncretized form of Yahweh was cloaked in the habiliments of the returning Tammuz, who was festally received each spring. The sixty warriors who accompanied Solomon’s bed and carriage in the above verse, were seen by Schmokel as relating to the sacred number of Ishtar, (appearing also in the 6:8 reference to the sixty Queens), and were present to protect Tammuz in his return from the Netherworld. “The sword bearers surround the throne on which the chosen representative of Tammuz sits in splendor; smoke rises from the brazier before him and the choir assembled in the sanctuary sings an introit. This is the beginning of the third and final scene of the cult-drama of the Song of Songs as understood by Schmokel”(Pope 1977).

When Jerusalem was captured by David, the worship of Tammuz and Astarte continued and Solomon for political reasons installed it in the Temple. Its influence can be seen in the description of the Temple structure, vessels, and ceremonies… Spices peculiar to the Tammuz cult were used in the sacred Solomon and the Song of Songs oil and incense, Exodus 30. A strong party, including many Judeans, was devoted to these divinities and their interests had to be considered and conciliated, especially in view of the prophetic opposition. At the spring festival the king and queen represented the god and goddess in a sacred marriage.… Yahweh was gradually substituted for Tammuz and the Daughter of Jerusalem for Astarte, but the ritual remained essentially the same.… The Canticles, originally a Tammuz liturgy, were preserved among other sacred scriptures in the temple archives “Because they referred in some way to the service and ceremonies of the temple” [(Schoff, 1924)] (Pope 1977). The royal priestess, acting as the surrogate of the goddess, pre-Marriage, by anointing him with oil, which some sources have suggested represented the semen of the fertility god that the male participant was imitating, whether that Baal, Tammuz, Adonis, Attis or another regional deity. Professor John Allegro referred to anointing with “various saps and resins as representing the divine semen.” John Allegro, the controversial English archaeologist and Dead Sea Scrolls scholar, made the claim “Since all life derives from the divine seed, it follows that the most powerful healing drugs would be pure, unadulterated semen of the god. Some plants were thought to have sap or resin approximating to this, their ‘purity’ or ‘sanctity’ in this regard being measured by their power as drugs to kill or cure or intoxicate” (Allegro 1970). The semen of the fertility god could be seen spurting as rain from heaven during an orgasmic thunderstorm; in concentrated form it appeared in certain powerful plants like the Mandrake, or Holy Plant … or in aromatic gums and resins that formed part of the traditional unctions of the priests and kings. Such functionaries thus became “holy,” that is, separated to the god’s for service, being smeared, or “anointed” with his divine Substance. They were therefore called the “anointed ones,” that is “messiahs,” or “Christs,” more specifically in the Old Testament, “those anointed with Jehovah/Yahweh” (1 Samuel 26:11, Psalms 2:2). (Allegro 1980).7 Unfortunately, in this regard, as noted earlier, Allegro failed to recognize the role of cannabis in regard to kaneh bosm, due to his own apparent cultural bias.

However, despite Allegro’s confusion of the sacred mushroom with cannabis, the connection between divine semen and the precious ointment is made more intriguing by context and also by the Hebrew word for ointment, and the sacred oil, semen. The priestly traditions describe the oil used as the semen hammišņâ, “the anointing oil,” or šemen mišħat-qodes “sacred anointing oil.” However, the English term “semen,” is generally believed to have come through late Middle English: from Latin, literally “seed,” from serere “to sow.” As noted earlier, the Hebrew name for semen, zera also means “seed,” and is phonetically similar to serere. Besides having similarities to the word for “seed” of man, animal and vegetation, zera, is also directly related to the Hebrew words “zerem,” meaning “flood … shower, storm and the word zirmah, means “a gushing of fluid (semen):–issue” (Strong 1979). Despite the limited use of anointing oil in the Hebrew kingdom, as well as in the surrounding empires, the use of the sacred incense went far beyond the Spring Festivals, and was a year-round event: “the cloud filled the temple of the Lord [that Solomon built]. And the priests could not perform their service because of the cloud” (1 Kings 8:10). Like the references to this cloud in the story of Moses and the Tent of the Meeting, the cloud of incense smoke “was the palpable sign of God’s presence in Solomon’s temple” (Patai 1967). Apparently, Solomon did not limit his use of incense to the tem-ple of Yahweh, or the Lord’s worship. “Solomon loved Yahweh: sacrifice and incense on the high places” (I Kings 3:3). Here we can see references to Solomon’s worship of the Goddess who was conventionally worshiped on mountains and hilltops. The Hebrew Bible itself testifies to this, telling us that Solomon’s “foreign wives led him astray” and that through them the Hebraic king had begun “following Ashtoreth, the goddess of the Sidonians” (1 Kings 11:3-5). This Goddess is usually associated with Astarte, but in reference to this Patai suggested that this was actually Asherah under the regional name of the Elath of Sidon. “Asherah was associated with several cities where she was worshiped in her local manifestations. She was the ‘Asherah of Tyre’ and the ‘Elath [Goddess] of Sidon’” (Patai, 1990).: Among the deities whom Solomon worshiped was “the Goddess of the Sidonians” who … was none other than Asherah.

However, the historian recording this calls her “Ashtoreth, Goddess of the Sidonoans.” Also, the prophet Ahijah the Shilonite, an uncompromising Yahwist, who flourished towards the end of Solomon’s reign … reproaches the Israelites with once worshiping “Ashtoreth, the Goddess of the Sidonians,” and another time with serving Asherah. However, such confusion … is not confined to the Biblical authors who equally detested both of them; it is found … in the Amarna letters written in the 14th century B.C.E. by people who should have known better because they believed in the two goddesses and worshiped them. But we have to keep in mind in polytheistic cultures the prevalent tendency often was to identify one god with another, substitute one god for another, combine one god with another, or call one god by the name of another, as we see from many examples in the Egyptian, Babylonian, Hittite or Canaanite religions. In any case, there can be little doubt that it was the worship of Asherah, already popular among the Hebrews for several generations, which was introduced by Solomon into Jerusalem as part of the cult of the royal household, for his Sidonian wife (Patai 1990). While both Biblical references and archaeological finds attest that “the worship of Asherah was thus a central feature of popular Hebrew religion in the pre-monarchic period, and her statues stood in many a local sanctuary, it remained for King Solomon to introducer her worship into his capital city of Jerusalem” (Patai, 1990). Like the Qedeshim of Asherah Astarte’s worshipers included male transvestites, (which can be identified with the male cult prostitutes in the Hebrew Bible and who at times penetrated into the Temple itself), known as kurgarrus who performed music for the goddess’ pleasure, as well as fumigating her with incense of fragrant cane, i.e.: qunubu. Pope compares these “sweet reeds” to the same references in the Bible that we have been focusing on: “The ‘sweet reed’ … with which the goddess’ inwards are soothed, is presumably the same ‘aromatic cane’ of Exod 30:23 and the ‘sweet cane’ of Jer 6:20; Isa 43:24; Ezek 27:19 and simply ‘cane’ in Canticles 4 : 14^(′′) (Pope 1977). Unfortunately, Pope seems to be unaware, or chose not to mention it, that these same references to “cane” are the ones that Sula Benet first identified in 1936 as references to cannabis under the name kaneh.

As we have seen, qunubu was one of the main ingredients in the Near Eastern Sacred rite, (Waterman 1930) and we now know of direct references to the use of both a cannabis infused beverage and ointments that were dedicated to Ishtar from ancient inscriptions. We can be relatively sure that the reference to how the fumes of the incense “ease her mind,” identify the entheogenic properties of cannabis smoke. The fragrant procession described in the ancient pagan hymn, clearly “recalls the columns of smoke and clouds of myrrh and frankincense which accompany Solomon’s litter as it rises from the desert or steppe-land surrounded by the sixty skilled swordsmen, like the kurgarrus who accompany Inanna/Ishtar” (Pope 1977). The description of the carriages and processions which accompanied “Solomon’s bed,” and its Mesopotamian counterparts, once again brings to mind some amazing parallels with still existent rituals practiced in India. This time we look at the “Festival of Chariots,” as performed by the Jagannath cult in Puri, a ritual that is of pre-Vedic origins. In this ancient and still partially performed rite, massive elaborately decorated chariots (representing the world in motion) are drawn carrying the veiled figures of Jagannath, “the Lord of the Universe” his brother Balabhadra and his sister Subhadra. It is believed by some, that one of these veiled figures is a giant Lingam, although this is unknown as the Jagannath Mandir in Puri is off limits to outsiders. The Jagannath Mandir was the last temple to maintain classical [Indian] dance, up until the mid-1950s – now it is strictly a theatrical art.… The British … suppressed this aspect of liturgy as rude, calling the devadasis or maharis [the ritual wives of the god] nuatch-girls or prostitutes [they performed naked, judging by the sculpture on the natamandapas or natamandiras, “dance platforms or temples,” for the public, and among their duties was maithuna-type ritual sex with the Brahmins in the temple, with which Cannabis use seems to be associated, to please Indra and bring on the monsoon]. As a result the practice, once widespread throughout India … all but disappeared, except in Puri, and the other styles were preserved only in villages by gotipuas, boys dressed as girls, only to be revived as classical art in our time… (Ott 1996). In the Jagannath festival of Puri, we see the massive chariots and their entourage, analogous to the procession which accompanied Solomon’s bed, and Ishtar’s in the Mesopotamian counterpart. Temple prostitutes played the role of “the wives of the god-king,” and had sex with the king (or priest) in order to bring on the", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634243995_cleaned.txt:118:2a4ad38bdf5f", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 2068, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634243995_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634243995", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634243995_cleaned", "chunk_index": 119, "text": "and the other styles were preserved only in villages by gotipuas, boys dressed as girls, only to be revived as classical art in our time… (Ott 1996).

Temple prostitutes played the role of “the wives of the god-king,” and had sex with the king (or priest) in order to bring on the seasonal rains. A similar role was taken on by the Shulamite in the Songs, and the priestess who enacts the part of Ishtar in the Sumerian counterpart of the ritual drama. Other similarities occur throughout, such as the role of transvestites in all three ritual-dramas, and the use of cannabis in their cultic rituals. Anthropologist Frederique Marglin, who noted the use of cannabis by the Jagannath cult, referred to the many similarities between the Indian and Mesopotamian fertility dramas and commented that in both cases, in the performance of the sexual act it is “not procreation” that is sought, “but the assurance of abundant crops and endorsement of the kings ability to rule… The sacrifice of one’s reproductive capacity is symbolically akin to death. The paradox of general fertility brought about by sexual activity of persons who have sacrificed their own fecundity … [and is a] symbolic expression of the widespread sacrificial theme of renewed life through death” (Marglin 1986). In light of Pope’s connection of the fragrant incense used by the cult of Ishtar with the Biblical references to kaneh (cannabis), and the copious incense referred to in the Songs, it is interesting to note that the next direct Biblical account of cannabis by the name kaneh appears in Solomon’s Songs, (the poetic imagery of this verse brings to the initiate’s mind the sweet seductive scent of blonde Lebanese hashish): Come with me from Lebanon, my bride, Come with me from Lebanon. Descend from the crest of Amana, from the top of Senir, The summit of Hermon [High Places]… How delightful is your love, my sister, my bride! How much more pleasing is your love than wine, And the fragrance of your ointment than any spice!… The fragrance of your garments is like that of Lebanon… Your plants are an orchard of pomegranates, With choice fruits, with henna and nard, Nard and saffron, kaneh [cannabis] and cinnamon, with every kind of incense tree… – Song of Songs 4:8-14 In the Songs, we see cannabis not only as incense, but also in relation to the sacred anointing oil in the above verse in the form of the fragrant “ointment.” The comparison between the fragrance of the oil, with that of the wine also occurs in Songs 1:2-4 “…for your love is more delightful than wine. Pleasing is the fragrance of your precious ointments; your name is like precious ointment poured", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634243995_cleaned.txt:119:d123b2d6ad15", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 2069, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634243995_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634243995", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634243995_cleaned", "chunk_index": 120, "text": "kind of incense tree… – Song of Songs 4:8-14 In the Songs, we see cannabis not only as incense, but also in relation to the sacred anointing oil in the above verse in the form of the fragrant “ointment.” The comparison between the fragrance of the oil, with that of the wine also occurs in Songs 1:2-4 “…for your love is more delightful than wine. Pleasing is the fragrance of your precious ointments; your name is like precious ointment poured out.… We shall inhale thy love rather than wine.” This indicates the possibility that at this time mandrake was being used in conjunction with hemp in the Holy anointing oil, as it was in 19th century astral traveling salves, as well as medieval magical ointments. Such would account for some of the more ecstatic behavior associated with the anointing oil, such as the frenzied behavior of Saul a generation earlier. Ethnobotanist Christian Rätsch claims that its probable that “the oldest written mentions of the mandrake occur in the cuneiform tablets of the Assyrians.… An Ugaritic cuneiform text from Ras Shamra (fifteenth to fourteenth century B.C.E.) appears to refer to a ritual text, ‘[P]lant mandragoras in the ground’ … Mesopotamian cuneiform texts make frequent mention of a wine known as cow’s eye,8 which was purportedly a wine mixed with mandrake” (Rätsch, 2005). Rätsch also refers to the use of the plant in ancient Egypt, where “mandrake fruits were used as gifts of love during courtship and probably were eaten as aphrodisiacs. The love plant appears to have been associated with Hathor the goddess of love” (Rätsch, 2005). Interestingly this goddess has a well known association with Asherah and numerous Canaanite amulets depict her wearing a bouffant wig identical with that of the Egyptian Hathor. One of the potsherd inscriptions of blessings discussed earlier of “Yahweh and his Asherah” from 8th century BCE Kuntillet Ajrud, appears with a cow feeding its calf, which is also seen as a symbol associated with Hathor. [] Left: Canaanite amulet depicting Asherah with a Hathor Wig. Right: (Egyptian statue of Hathor) In Reinstating the Divine Woman in Judaism, Jenny Kien explains “In the 14-12th century BCE, Asherah became popular in Egypt, where she was known as Qudsu (Qadesh) or holiness, and this epithet spread to Phoenicia. Qudsu became so strongly associated with the Egyptian goddess Hathor that no description of Ashera-Qudsu is complete without mentioning Hathor” (Kien, 2000). The Egyptians recognized Hathor in the Asherah known as the Ba’alat (Mistress) of byblos. The north Canaanite port of Byblos was one of Egypt’s major trading partners, and Egyptian influence was so strong there that the Ba’alat of Byblos took on Egyptian form.

The sun god Ra was angry with humans because they had contrived to attack him. In his anger, he created the terrible lion-headed goddess Sekmet (an early form of Hathor) to punish the race of humans. She raged among the people for an entire day and was not yet finished when the sun set, for she wanted to utterly extinguish humanity. But Ra did not want this, and he thought of a trick to end the goddess’s deadly rampage. He had mandrake fruits brought to him from Elephantine, an island in the Nile …; according to other versions and/ or translations, … “red ocher” was brought as well.… At the same time, he ordered the production of a huge amount of barley beer (seven thousand jugs). He mixed the mandrakes (and the … red ocher) into this and had the fields covered in the blood-red beer (the “sleeping drink”). The following sunrise, when the goddess saw the beer, she first perceived her reflection and thus recognized herself. Because of its red color, she thought the beer was human blood, and she eagerly drank it to the last drop. “Her countenance became gentle as a result, and she drank; this did her heart well. Drunken did she return, without having recognized the people”… Othmar Keel, Professor of Old Testament and Biblical Studies at the University of Freibourg, Germany, points out the similarity between Egyptian love poems with references to mandrakes and the Songs: “The plant occurs frequently in Egyptian pictures from the New Kingdom (1540-1075 B.C.).… The ancient Egyptian love song also describes the effect of the love apple. The man sings: ‘If only I were her Nubian maid, her attendant in secret! She would let me bring her love apples [i.e., mandrakes]; when it was in her hand, she would smell it, and she would show me the hue of her whole body’ [Cairo Love Songs, Group B, no. 21]. The woman’s skin is described in another love song: ‘Your skin is the skin of the mandrake, which induces loving’” (The Song of Songs, Continental Commentaries, 1994). Another of the Egyptian love songs mentions mandrakes in an interesting parallel to the blossoming of love we have seen: “If only my sister were mine every day, like the greenery of a wreath! … The reeds are dried, the safflower has blossomed, the mrbbflowers are (in) a cluster(?), the lapis-lazuli", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634243995_cleaned.txt:121:8cb60594d3f1", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 2071, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634243995_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634243995", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634243995_cleaned", "chunk_index": 122, "text": "no. 21].

She would be with me every day, like (the) greenery of a wreath, all the blossoms are flourishing in the meadow … entirely”9 In The Complete Gods and Goddesses of Ancient Egypt, Richard H. Wilkinson, notes that “the Greeks identified Hathor with Aphrodite” (Wikinson, 2003). In this regard it is worth noting that when the ancient Greeks referred to Egyptian gods by the names of their own deities, through a practice called interpretatio graeca, they sometimes called Hathor, Aphrodite. Aphrodite is also connected with other ancient Near Eastern Goddesses. The Cypriot cult of Aphrodite developed directly out of the Oriental cult of the love goddess Ishtar, Astarte, Asherot, et cetera. J Rendel Harris proposed the theory that the Greek cult of Aphrodite could be traced back to the Greek assimilation of the Oriental conceptions about the mandrake (Harris 1917). Aphrodite was also known as Mandragoritis (“she of the Mandragora”…). The Mandragora thus had an intimate connection to the love goddess and was sacred to her.… In the late ancient Mysteries of the Great Goddess, Aphrodite was identified with Hecate.… Thus the “mandrake of Hecate” was nothing other than the sacred plant of the love goddess (Rätsch, 2005). The idea that behind the figure of Aphrodite there stands the more ancient Semitic goddess of love, Ishtar-Astarte was recognized in ancient times, Herodotus (1.105, 131) and Philo of Byblos (Eus. Prep. evang. 1.812) both referred to this connection. We have discussed the blending and overlapping of various regional goddesses, in some cases going back to their common origins, in others later adaptations and Asherah, as well, can be tied in with these other Goddesses. As William Dever has noted: “Canaanite-Israelite Asherah appears later as Greek Aphrodite … goddesses of beauty, love, and sexual pleasure. The similarities are unequivocal: Asherah and Aphrodite are both connected to the sea, and doves are symbols of both. Aphrodite’s lover Adonis clearly preserves the earlier Phoenician-Hebrew word adon, ‘Lord’” (Dever, 2008). In ancient times, the primary ritual significance of the mandrake was in erotic cults. Because of the poor quality of the sources that have come down to us, however, only rudimentary information about these practices is available. The most important source about the use of mandrake in the Orient is the Old Testament, where the", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634243995_cleaned.txt:122:a80690afedb5", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 2072, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634243995_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634243995", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634243995_cleaned", "chunk_index": 123, "text": "are both connected to the sea, and doves are symbols of both.

Because of the poor quality of the sources that have come down to us, however, only rudimentary information about these practices is available. The most important source about the use of mandrake in the Orient is the Old Testament, where the fruits (love apples) are mentioned numerous times under the Old Testament Hebrew name duda’ im, and namely as an aphrodisiac… (Rätsch, 2005) Referring to mandrakes or love apples, as they were otherwise known, W.E. Budge commented that, “These are mentioned in the Bible … and there is no doubt that ancients used decoctions of the plant both as aphrodisiacs and as narcotics” (Budge 1930). In the Genesis 30:14-15 account, it is in exchange for sex, that mandrakes are given. The Hebrew name of the plant דּוּדָאַ םי , dudaïm´ shares the same root as ודֹד/dod – the Hebrew word for love or lover, and this is seen as a connection between the two. Pope notes reference to a cognate term in the Baal and Anat hieros gamos hymns, clearly indicating the use of mandrakes in the Ugaritic love poems, and with yet another Near Eastern Goddess. Interestingly, the “Syriac version of Hermes Trismegistos contained a story in which King Solomon had a mandrake in his signet ring whose miraculous qualities enabled women to give safe birth without pain” (Riddle, 2010). As well, we will discuss in a later chapter, mandrake and its fruits, or “love-apples” have been seen as the Biblical Tree of Knowledge in Eden, from at least the 2nd Century CE. In that account, both aphrodisiacal and psychoactive effects might be interpreted: “Eve’s act of eating the mandrake caused her and Adam to conceive, but her persuasion of Adam to eat it in the first place caused him to have understanding (reason)” (Riddle, 2010). However, despite this strong connection to love poems and sexuality in the ancient literature, no medical reason behind the aphrodisiacal reputation of the mandrake has ever been discovered. In reference to the Genesis account, the Christian Doctor Robert Greenblatt suggested “What helped Rachel to conceive was not the fertilizing but the tranquillizing properties of the mandrake; the mandrake soothed her anxieties” (Greenblatt, 1963). The odor of mandrakes is reportedly pungent and distinctive and was presumably pleasant or exciting.

While Occidental aesthetics may regard the scent as fetid rather than fragrant, it is well known that odors which may be offensive to some can be highly provocative to others. The belief that the plant has potency as an aphrodisiac could influence one’s reaction to the odor. Just where the mandrakes were located with relation to the lovers, whether in the field, or at the door with other delectables, or by their couch is not clear (Pope, 1977). As Pope explains it, mandrake and cannabis, with their shared reputation as entheogens and aphrodisiacs, seemed to have traveled the road together somewhat through history, to the point that a name for cannabis came to be applied to mandrake. “Among the modern Palestinian names for the mandrake …[is] banj which appears suspiciously similar to the Indian term bhang which in northern India is applied by Hindu votaries of Tantrism to … Cannabis Indica, used as an aphrodisiac in the ‘left handed’ rites which are climaxed with … maithuna, sexual union. The hemp is prepared as a dessert in the shape of molasses, or as a beverage with sweet sherbet” (Pope, 1977). Considering Pope’s comparison of the Songs with the hymns of Kali, the connection here with the use of cannabis is interesting. Kali’s cannabis mantra is, ^(*)Om , Hrim Ambrosia, that springeth forth from ambrosia, Thou shalt showerest ambrosia, draw ambrosia for me again and again. Bring Kalika within my control. Give success; Svaha” (Avalon, 1913). In Tantric rites, cannabis retained its ancient Vedic epithet of ‘Vijaya’ (Victory). As Arthur Avalon (aka, Sir John Woodroffe) explained: “Vijaya, (victory) used in ceremonies to Kali: That is the narcotic Bhang (hemp) … used in all ceremonies” (Avalon, 1913). As Robert Anton Wilson, noted in his ground-breaking study Sex & Drugs: “the cannabis drugs are especially likely to cause [the] … kind of concentration … in which one may … become totally identified with the sex organs and lose all other awareness entirely” (Wilson 1973). A perfect frame of mind for the orgiastic type of worship inferred by the Hebrew Bible narrative. A number of books have been written specifically regarding cannabis’ role in sex, and more recently, A Stanford University study published in The Journal of Sexual Medicine, released a paper “Association Between Marijuana Use and Sexual Frequency in the United States: A Population-Based Study” (2017) that concluded “The results of 28,176 women (average age = 29.9 years) and 22,943 men (average age $= 2 9 . 5 \\AA$ ) were analyzed … marijuana users had significantly higher sexual frequency compared with never users.… An overall trend for men … and women … was identified showing that higher marijuana use was associated with increased coital frequency” (Sun & Eisenberg, 2017).

How the mandrakes and cannabis would have been used from the Songs is unknown. References to ointments in the Songs is your love than wine, and the fragrance of your ointment than any spice!” (Song of Songs 4:10); As our indications of incense in association with cannabis: “with henna and nard, nard and saffron, kaneh [cannabis] and cinnamon, with every kind of incense tree…” (Song of Songs 4:14). In the Hebrew text, the phrase in italics reads: “I have eaten my wood (yagar) with my honey (debash).” St. Jerome, in the Vulgate, translated the Hebrew word meaning “wood” by favum, or honey-comb – comedi favum cum melle meo; which is not only a bold license, but a platitude to boot, inasmuch as there is neither wit nor point in making one to eat the honeycomb with the honey. The LXX adopted a similar license, but avoided the platitude, by translating thus: … “I have eaten my bread with my honey” … the word yagar, which the Vulgate translated favum for the occasion, is used in some fifty or sixty other places of O.T. always in the sense of wood, forest, planted field, herbage, or the like. The meaning of Cant.10 5:1, is clear enough in its aphrodisiac context: “I have eaten my hemp with my honey” (Creighton, 1903). In relation, one of the references to the Hebrew term eshisha, which the 19th century Biblical scholar Kitto suggested served as a root word for the Arabic hashish, occurs in Song of Songs 2:5, here translated as “raisin cake”: “Strengthen me with raisin cakes eshisha, refresh me with apples, for I am weak with love.” These same cakes would come to be detested “they turn to other gods and love the sacred raisin cakes eshisha” (Hosea 3:1). This later rejection does make one ponder whether raisins were intended in the Hebrew eshisha or something with more of a ritual effect. Some of the above references to similar rites clearly indicate a sacred beverage was infused with the plant. Perhaps sacred infusions were part of the ritual sacred weddings? This is intriguing given that Ishtar had her own cannabis infused aromatic beer, and lotions as well. Moreover, as we have seen, mandrakes appear in Ishtar’s love liturgy and we also have Hathor’s mandrake beer.

In reference to the Assyrian sacred rites, a paper on opium and hashish from the Compte Rendu, Rencontre Assyriologique Internationale, also refers to a ritual drink, thought to be entheogenic, but of unknown contents. It is conceivable that references to “spiced wine” in the Song of Songs refers to a similar infusion. As we shall see later in our discussion of the prophet Ezra, there are numerous indications that the ancient Hebrews, like their neighboring kingdoms, had beverages infused with cannabis, opium, mandrake and likely other psychoactive ingredients. A Fertility RiteThe Sacred Marriage was a pagan ritual which held paramount imfertility of the land. Clearly, both the use of entheogenic substances and ritual sex played paramount roles in this ritual drama. Through the evidence of the Songs and Solomon’s own reign, we can see that this sacred ritual would have been practiced in the Temple of Jerusalem itself. As with tel Arad and its two altars, indicating the combined worship of Yahweh and Asherah, we can be confident that the temple Solomon built paid reverence to the Goddess as well. The references to both cannabis and mandrake in the Songs, show these same practices at play in the Hebrew variation of the Hieros Gamos Through this rite, the king and his kingdom believed they attained the assurance of the continued fecundity of the land. A similar relationship is inferred from Solomon’s coronation and anointing. In the Psalms we read of the King’s role as the bestower of fertility through the rite of the Sacred Marriage: “Endow your king with justice, O God…. He will endure as long as the sun…. He will be like … showers watering the earth…. Let corn abound throughout the land; on the tops of the hills may it sway. Let its fruit flourish like Lebanon; let it thrive like the grass of the field. May his name endure forever” (Psalm 72:1-17). Ritual license as a regularly (in many places annually) recurring feature of temple worship is well attested from all over the ancient Near East. It was … standard practice of the cultic veneration of the divine powers of life and fertility. As Nelson Glueck recently observed: “The excitement of pagan worship and participation in feasts of sacrificial offerings apparently often led male and female worshipers to join together in feverish consummation of fertility rites.” The mythical counterpart of this orgiastic ritual was, in ancient Israel as well as among other ancient Near Eastern peoples, the great cosmogonical and cosmological myth cycle, according to which the annual period of vegetative fertility was preceded by", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634243995_cleaned.txt:126:0e1782221ab2", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 2076, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634243995_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634243995", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634243995_cleaned", "chunk_index": 127, "text": "of the divine powers of life and fertility. As Nelson Glueck recently observed: “The excitement of pagan worship and participation in feasts of sacrificial offerings apparently often led male and female worshipers to join together in feverish consummation of fertility rites.” The mythical counterpart of this orgiastic ritual was, in ancient Israel as well as among other ancient Near Eastern peoples, the great cosmogonical and cosmological myth cycle, according to which the annual period of vegetative fertility was preceded by a union of the male and female elements of nature. To ensure that this great cosmological copulation take place in the proper measure and with the requisite intensity, man himself, it was felt, had to perform the sacred sex act, thereby both indicating to the elements of nature what was expected of them and inducing them to do the same through the compulsive force of a religio-magical act. (Patai 1990) All of … [the] gods and goddesses worshiped by Israel’s neighbors near and far were intimately and organically related to nature and the various forces and powers encountered there. For the most part they appeared in male/female pairs and were pictured in the myths and legends creating the world by copulation. They had special responsibility for fecundity and fertility of all sorts of conditions. Their worship apparently required a kind of imitative magic in which male and female devotees yoked their bodies sexually and spilled their seed upon the field they desired to yield bounteous crops. Orgies involving the use of intoxicants and indiscriminate sexual activity played an important part in these cults, and many Israelites gladly became apostates to these weird and wondrous religions. The inexperience of the nomadic Hebrews in the task of agriculture in their new homeland made them easy converts to the local Baals who promised good harvests. The exotic character of the cult with its mystic roots extending far back into antiquity, together with the highly sensual pleasures afforded in the worship, combined to make it an attractive type of religious experience. Any such temple in modern society would encounter no difficulty in attracting large numbers of devotees. (Cole 1959) It has been suggested that such ritual sexual pairing in this context, began with the introduction of the date palm – a dioecious tree with sexes in separate trees, requiring fertilization by man’s intervention, or by that of cherub nature daemons (wind, birds, bees etc.), thus making the relationship analogous to human sexuality in the mind of primitive people (Smith 1927). Cannabis, as we have seen, played a major ritual role in the ancient Near East, and like the date palm is dioecious, having two very distinct sexes. In reference to cannabis in this respect it should also be noted that hemp is an annual crop and would require continued fertilization each year for the seeds of the next generation, unlike the date palm, which", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634243995_cleaned.txt:127:c7c7541f45cb", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 2077, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634243995_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634243995", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634243995_cleaned", "chunk_index": 128, "text": "thus making the relationship analogous to human sexuality in the mind of primitive people (Smith 1927).

In reference to cannabis in this respect it should also be noted that hemp is an annual crop and would require continued fertilization each year for the seeds of the next generation, unlike the date palm, which grows larger, year after year, resulting in continually standing groves. Thus hemp is a far more likely candidate for the crop which continually required, in the minds of the ancient Near Eastern fertility cult, orgiastic rites of sympathetic magic. It is also known that a “number of traditions developed around the hemp harvest that involved rituals based on intoxication from the volatile resins and oils” (Emboden 1972). The addition of sexual license developing at such pagan rituals does not take a lot of imagination. As Sula Benet also noted: Since the plant was associated with religious ritual and the power of healing, magical practices were connected with its cultivation.… The odor of … hemp is stimulating enough to produce euphoria and a desire for sociability and gaiety and harvesting of hemp has always been accompanied by social festivities, dancing, and sometimes even erotic playfulness (Benet 1975). It is in the orgiastic and drug induced ecstasies of the “high places,” practiced through the Tantric-like fertility rites found throughout the ancient Near East, that we find the paganistic roots of the Sacred Marriage described in the Hebrew Bible’s Song of Songs. Further evidence that Solomon adopted aspects of the already existing Canaanite fertility cult can be seen in Psalm 110:4, where Solomon acts the part of a priest by blessing the assemblage at the consecration of the Temple, and is referred to as “a priest of the order of Melchizedek for ever.” “Melchizedek was a priest of El ‘Elyon (‘God most High’) in Salem, i.e. Jerusalem, and it is clear that he represents Canaanite religion” (Ringgren 1973). A later Gnostic tractate the Pistis Sophia, describes Melchizedek as the “hand” of the goddess herself. Despite Solomon’s connection with the fertility rituals practiced throughout the ancient world, and his supposedly sinful worship of gods besides Yahweh, he is referred to in the Bible as the wisest of men. Yahweh himself bestowed this gift upon Solomon at the high place of Gibeah after granting the king the fulfillment of one wish. For this wish Solomon chose wisdom, and was told by the Lord “I will give you a wise and discerning heart, so that there will never have been anyone like you, nor will there ever be” (1 Kings 3:12). Interestingly, Solomon’s relationship with cannabis extends beyond the reference in the Songs, and can be seen in later literature that developed around the king’s alleged", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634243995_cleaned.txt:128:99b5e6dd4f00", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 2078, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634243995_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634243995", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634243995_cleaned", "chunk_index": 129, "text": "Solomon at the high place of Gibeah after granting the king the fulfillment of one wish.

Interestingly, Solomon’s relationship with cannabis extends beyond the reference in the Songs, and can be seen in later literature that developed around the king’s alleged magical abilities and knowledge. The Testament of Solomon, thought to date from sometime between the first and third century AD, is one of the oldest magical texts concerning the ancient Jewish king. This text is a pseudepigraphic catalog of demons summoned by King Solomon, and how they can be countered by invoking angels and other magical techniques. The Testament of Solomon refers to a story where the magician-king forces a demon to spin hemp! “So I commanded her to spin the hemp for the ropes used in the building of the house of God; and accordingly, when I had sealed and bound her, she was so overcome and brought to naught as to stand night and day spinning the hemp” (The Testament of Solomon, 100-300 AD). Sula Benet, referring to the 1912 work of Georg Salzberger, Salomons Tempelbau und Thron, wrote “King Solomon, … friend of King Hiram of Tyre …, ordered hemp cords among other materials for building his temple and throne” (Benet, 1975). Solomon’s reputation for magic persisted through the centuries and we can see this in medieval European magical traditions where grimoires like, Clavicula Salomonis, “The Key of Solomon” (14th-15th century) and the 17th-century Clavicula Salomonis Regis, “The Lesser Key of Solomon” both of which represents a typical example of Renaissance magic, carried his name. Most interesting of such magical manuscripts, is the 16th century Sepher Raziel: Liber Salomonis, which refers to cannabis specifically, in an anointing oil used to see spirits: The third herbe is Canabus [cannabis]& it is long in shafte & clothes be made of it. The vertue of the Juse [juice]of it is to anoynt thee with it & with the juse of arthemesy & ordyne thee before a mirrour of stele [steel]& clepe thou spiritts & thou shallt see them & thou shalt haue might of binding & of loosing deuills [devils]& other things. (Sepher Raziel: Liber Salomonis, 1564). Indeed, cannabis seems to have been used here, in a similar way that it was used in the Holy of Holies, but instead of seeing spirits and devils in a blackened mirror, the “angel of the lord” was seen and consulted in a pillar of smoke. And it is such a scenario as this we will be turning to, with a look at the reference to kaneh in Isaiah. learly, the indications from the Song of Songs, and the account of Solomon, indicate", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634243995_cleaned.txt:129:3faba506495b", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 2079, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634243995_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634243995", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634243995_cleaned", "chunk_index": 130, "text": "to have been used here, in a similar way that it was used in the Holy of Holies, but instead of seeing spirits and devils in a blackened mirror, the “angel of the lord” was seen and consulted in a pillar of smoke. And it is such a scenario as this we will be turning to, with a look at the reference to kaneh in Isaiah. learly, the indications from the Song of Songs, and the account of Solomon, indicate that polytheism was a standard form of religion in Jerusalem at that time. Archaeological evidence attests to this state as well. Both the books of Kings and Chronicles indicate the prevalence of the worship of Asherah, through the ashiram or asherah poles, along with Baal and other deities in the Holy land, and even within the confines of the temple itself. Polytheism, like monotheism, comes with its own set of problems. One of these is the vying for favor with the Royalty and the people that supported the temples. Also important to note is that there was virtually no separation between church and state at that time, so political influence and control came into play as well. These factors can be seen in the account of the Biblical prophet Isaiah, who was said to have lived during the reign of the King Hezekiah (722-701 BCE) whose monotheistic reforms are believed to have been behind the cancellation of the tel Arad temple site. Interestingly, the account of kaneh as cannabis in Isaiah, may give us some indication about the core issues of the conflict that led to a campaign of Yahweh-alone worship. This is a complicated issue, and there are multiple compounded factors at play here. Some of it was purely political. The Jewish kingdom, surrounded by larger encroaching empires, did indeed have a need to consolidate for political reasons of protecting its existence. However, other reasons had to do with temple life, and where the various votive offerings went. We have already seen the popularity of cannabis at the various temples throughout the ancient Near East, and discussed the expense this imported and sought after rare spice would have acquired. We can only imagine the competition between cults for a sacred incense and entheogenic substance, that aided one to hear the voices of the gods! It should be noted that although the traditional view is that the 66 chapters of Isaiah, were composed by the prophet himself, in two periods sometime between 740 BCE and 686 BCE set about 15 years apart, the current academic view is that more than one hand is at work in the books attributed to the prophet. The general historical view is that parts of the Chapters of 1-39 include works from Isaiah, but are also interspersed with later insertions from Deuteronomists writing at the time of Josiah, close to a century later, who will", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634243995_cleaned.txt:130:f0d71346bd58", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 2080, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634243995_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634243995", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634243995_cleaned", "chunk_index": 131, "text": "Isaiah, were composed by the prophet himself, in two periods sometime between 740 BCE and 686 BCE set about 15 years apart, the current academic view is that more than one hand is at work in the books attributed to the prophet.

The remaining chapters (40-66) were composed during the Babylonian Exile, around two hundred years after the alleged life of the historical Isaiah. Just as Moses received his answers in a billowing cloud of cannabis resin-infused smoke, we can see from the reference to kaneh in Isaiah, that when the cannabis was lacking, the scryed answers were more difficult to bring forth. Moreover, the Lord complains he has been shortchanged of his offering of cannabis explicitly. When the prophet seeks advice, the Lord angrily responds: “…You have not brought me sheep for burnt offerings nor honored me with your sacrifices. I have not burdened you with grain offerings, nor wearied you with demands for frankincense. You have not bought me any fragrant cane (cannabis [kaneh]) with your silver, or lavished on me the fat of your sacrifices. But you have burdened me with your sins and wearied me with your iniquities” (Isaiah 43:23-24). An earlier account from Isaiah, although not identifying cannabis by name, gives clear indications that at times the Lord’s hunger for his favorite smoke was being appeased and cannabis was being used as a shamanic incense inside the precincts of the temple at Jerusalem, in elaborate shamanic ceremonies: sins, thou hast wearied me with thine iniquities” and after his lips touch the tongs and a coal of incense from the altar, these are both cleansed: “this hath touched thy lips; and thine iniquity is taken away, and thy sin purged” (Isaiah 6:7). A redemptive act, comparable to the consumption of the later Eucharist, in the way it relieves one of the burdens of sin and iniquity, and this also which clearly connects the two verses. In one verse Sins and Iniquities are lifted through the use of kaneh, in the other God complains of being burdened by them, without an offering of kaneh.1 As well we see both kaneh (cannabis) and frankincense here together, both of which were recovered from the altars at tel Arad. There is a clear connection here. Both kaneh and frankincense will be found together again in the Jeremiah 6:20 reference, and as noted this was the case with the Song of Songs 4:14 as well. Also of interest here is the use of the term seraphim, as this clearly has", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634243995_cleaned.txt:131:aa7a1c71e8d9", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 2081, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634243995_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634243995", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634243995_cleaned", "chunk_index": 132, "text": "burdened by them, without an offering of kaneh.1 As well we see both kaneh (cannabis) and frankincense here together, both of which were recovered from the altars at tel Arad.

Also of interest here is the use of the term seraphim, as this clearly has connotations of serpents. A number of Hebrew Bible passages associate śerāphîm with serpents. In response to the Israelites’ rebellion in the wilderness the Lord sent “venomous [śerāphîm] snakes among them” (Numbers 21:6). After the people confessed their sin, the Lord ordered Moses “to make a snake [śārāph] and put it up on a pole” (Numbers 8). In this last verse the term śārāph refers back to the full phrase “venomous [śeraphîm] snakes.” In Deuteronomy 8:15 the wilderness is described as a “thirsty and waterless land, with its venomous snakes [nāchāš śārāph, literally, “seraph snake”] and scorpions.” Seraphim has also been translated as “fiery serpent” due to the verb śārāph, which means “to burn completely.” The noun śārāph would then mean “the burning/fiery one.” In relation, it has been suggested that the name of the priesthood instilled by Moses to man the Temple, the Levites, is related to the name Leviathan, a serpent like figure from Hebrew Bible mythology. Biblical reforms from Hezekiah included removing the bronze serpent from the temple, as the people burned incense to it. So, from these passages, we can see that cannabis was an integral part of temple worship at the time of Isaiah, and the Lord’s anger burned when he was not given his due offering of it. Such a shortage was due to the stiff competition for this precious commodity, by the cults of other gods and goddesses. At this time Israel is clearly polytheistic and Yahweh although at the top of the pantheon, competed for worshipers with other deities; Asherah was particularly popular. Yahweh’s grievance about not receiving enough cannabis is likely related to this precious commodity being used up by other cults, particularly Asherah’s. This is important to note, as this passage was written by the Deuteronomists, and indicates that they still favored cannabis as an integral part of their ritual worship. The rejection of it, as we shall see, comes from Jeremiah, whose works are wound up with the later “priestly editors,” after yet further reforms. Isaiah laments for the day when the people will “turn their eyes to the Holy One of Israel. They will not look to the altars, the work of their hands, and they will have no regard for the Asherah poles and the incense altars their fingers have made” (Isaiah 17:7-8).

Yahweh, the God “whose name is jealous” through Isaiah, condemns “a people who continually provoke me to my very face, offering sacrifices in gardens and burning incense on altars of brick” (Isaiah 65:3). Isaiah 27.9 has the patriarch Jacob, representing his descendants and describes what the Jews must do to atone for their sins of worshiping Asherah and burning incense to her: “Therefore, in this will the transgression of Jacob be atoned for, and this all the fruit of the removal of his sin, in his making all the stones of the altar like pulverized limestone, and they will not raise asherahs and incense altars.” Come, you sons of sorceress, Spawn of whoring adulteress, At whom you are gibing, At whom are you gaping. Poking out your tongue? You rebel rabble, Progeny of deceit, Inflaming yourselves at the oaks, Under every green tree; Butchering babes in the valleys Beneath the clefts of the cliffs. On the valley banks is your part; To them you pour libations, Offer up your grain gifts. On a high and lofty hill you set your couch, And go up to sacrifice. Behind the door you set the (phallic) symbol, Without me you strip and mount, You spread your bed, And make alliance with them. You love their couch, on the hand you gaze. You go to the King (Molek) with oil, Multiply your perfumes. You send emissaries afar, You descend to the netherworld. With your great strength, you are weary, But never say Enough, You find life in your hand, And you do not weaken. –Isaiah 57:3- who walk in ways not good… offering sacrifices in gardens and burning incense on altars of brick; who sit among the graves and spend their nights keeping secret vigil; who eat the flesh of pigs and whose pots hold broth of unclean meat; who say, ‘Keep away; don’t come near me, for I am too sacred for you!’ Such people are a smoke in my nostrils, a fire that keeps burning all day. –Isaiah 65:2-6 In the aforementioned passages from Isaiah, we see both the holy anointing oil (57:9) and the incense (65:3) being used in association with the pagan fertility rites. In the eyes of the Yahwehist prophet, the use of these substances is only evil when it is combined with the adulterous practice of worshiping other gods. Moreover, Isaiah 43:23-24, makes it abundantly clear, the Lord is angered when he does not receive his due of these substances.

Moreover, Isaiah 43:23-24, makes it abundantly clear, the Lord is angered when he does not receive his due of these substances. Up to this point, the prophets have been verily quiet on the subject of Asherah worship, and besides Isaiah 17:7-9 and 27.9 as well as Micah 5:14 (“I will uproot from among you your Asherah poles, when I demolish your cities”) there has been little to no reference to the cultic representation of the goddess. Phillip Johnston, a lecturer and supervisor at the Cambridge Faculty of Divinity has noted “the notable paucity of such texts indicates that the prophetic movement did not especially target Asherah worship, still less single it out for condemnation. For them it was simply one minor element of pervasive idolatry” ( Johnston, 2003). However, her cult clearly did create a competition for cannabis and other offerings, as well as other forms of temple support, and we can be sure this created a bone of contention. This situation continued under a number of royal households, with Queens such as the infamous Jezebel worshiping Asherah in both the temple and the palace. Asherah poles, both male and female temple prostitutes, are all described as present on the temple grounds. It was not until the time of King Hezekiah, who came to power during the time of Isaiah, that any form of monotheistic worship of Yahweh alone was successfully attempted. In the eyes of the Yahwehist narrator, Hezekiah (Strengthened of Jah) who ruled the southern kingdom from (715-687), only came second in his service to the Lord, to that of his even more aggressively reforming grandson Josiah. [Hezekiah] did what was right in the eyes of the LORD … He removed the high places, smashed the sacred stones and cut down the Asherah poles. He broke into pieces the bronze snake Moses had made, for up to that time the Israelites had been burning incense to it. (It was called Nehushtan). Hezekiah trusted in the LORD, the God of Israel. There was no one like him among all the kings of Judah, either before him or after him (2 Kings 18 3-5). After ridding the land of the high places and Asherahs, the next step taken by King Hezekiah is a very radical and surprising one: “He broke into pieces the bronze snake Moses had made, for up to that time the Israelites had been burning incense to it.” This is the first reference to this brazen serpent forged by Moses since the Exodus, created after his involvement with the Midianite “sons", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634243995_cleaned.txt:134:9001e77dc0e2", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 2084, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634243995_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634243995", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634243995_cleaned", "chunk_index": 135, "text": "either before him or after him (2 Kings 18 3-5).

Here in the Temple of Jerusalem itself, with the image of the serpent, the Ashera, the Cherubim, and the Menorah-representing the Tree of Life, we can clearly see the images of the fabled Garden of Eden that had been so demonized in the Genesis tale, continuing as regular aspects of Hebrew cultic worship! Obviously these figures all played an important role in the ritual dramas practiced in the Hebrew kingdom since the time of Solomon. Hezekiah, also desecrated the holy places he destroyed: “Then they demolished the pillar of Baal, and destroyed the temple of Baal, and made it a latrine to this day” (2 Kings 10:27). Interestingly, archaeological evidence of this particular reform has been recovered. As noted in the Newsweek article “Toilet Found in 3,000-Year-Old Shrine Verifies Bible Stories Against Idol Worship” by Kastalia Medrano: The stone toilet sits in Tel Lachish, a sprawling Iron Age city and the Kingdom of Judah’s most important one after the capitol, Jerusalem. It was found in what the archaeologists believe to be a gate-shrine within Israel’s largest ancient city gate. The ruler at that time, King Hezekiah, enacted campaigns of religious worship and reform that made their way into the Hebrew Bible on multiple occasions. In one corner of the shrine sits a stone seat with a hole in the center. The archaeologists believe that not only is it definitely a toilet, it’s a toilet that was installed for the express purpose of literally desecrating the shrine. Hezekiah, it seems, was just following instructions against idol worship in the scriptures. (Medrano, 2017) Hezekiah’s reforms also included reestablishing the holiday of the Passover which hadn’t been celebrated as the law was said to have required, for some centuries. Hezekiah’s reforms may have been done in part, under a sort of religio-political motivation, as an attempt to consolidate his kingdom in defense of the strong Assyrian presence and influences taking place. As pastor and Old Testament (Hebrew Bible) scholar Bernhard Anderson explained: As in the case of other religious revivals in Israel. Hezekiah’s religious reforms had certain political implications.

Ahaz’s appeasement policy, symbolized by the installation of an Assyrian altar in the Temple, had proved unpopular, especially among those who had to dig down in their pockets to pay heavy taxes for Assyrian tribute. Hezekiah’s purification of worship, including no doubt the removal of Assyrian cult objects from the Temple, was a stimulus to Judaean nationalism, for he was virtually declaring independence from Assyrian domina- We should consider these reforms in regard to the cancelation of the temple at tel Arad. The use of cannabis aka kaneh bosm, may well have been seen at the time to have been derived from Assyrian practices (considering the very similar ritual applications) even those indicated by Exodus 30:23. Tel Arad’s “disuse” is within the suggested time frame, although the temple may not have been canceled until the even more severe reforms carried out by Hezekiah’s grandson, Josiah. Hezekiah not only reformed his own people, he was also successful in battle, overcoming the Philistines “as far as Gaza” (2 Kings 18:8). So enthralled was Hezekiah with his own military success, that he went so far as to stop paying tribute to the Assyrians. A grave mistake in foreign policy, as the Assyrian forces would soon be returning from their foreign conquest. The Assyrians received tribute from many petty kingdoms of the region, a deal was that either they paid or suffered the wrath of their military, as did Judah from the result of Hezekiah’s deferred payment: “Sennacherib king of Assyria attacked all the fortified cities of Judah and captured them” (2 Kings 18:13). We learn more of Jerusalem’s siege in an account which describes the Judahites rebellion against their Assyrian overlords, both through withholding tribute and joining an anti-Assyrian coalition led by the Egyptians. An alliance that angered the Lord who the Bible has speak through the prophet Isaiah stating: “Woe to the obstinate children … to those who carry out plans that are not mine, forming an alliance, but not by my Spirit, heaping sin upon sin; who go down to Egypt without consulting me, who look for help to Pharaoh’s protection, to Egypt’s shade for refuge” (Isaiah 30:1-2). Sentiments that were echoed by the Assyrian king through a field commander, who sends word to Hezekiah, that the Assyrians forces had marched upon Jerusalem on the Lord’s own orders: On what are you basing this confidence of yours?

You say you have strategy and military strength – but you speak only empty words … you are depending on Egypt, that splintered reed of a staff, which pierces a man’s hand and wounds him if he leans on it! And if you say to me, “We are depending on the Lord our God” – isn’t he the one whose high places and altars Here we see the beginnings of an expression of the universality of Yahweh. He is now not only the God of his chosen people, but also God over the Assyrians, even though they don’t worship him. That the Assyrians acknowledge and obey the God of the Israelites as their own is of course nonsense from a historical point of view. Asshur was the high god of the Assyrian pantheon and they were never subject to Yahweh. The composer of the text, by pointing out that even the Assyrians were obedient to Yahweh, is emphasizing the opposite extent to which the Israelites had departed from their covenant with the Lord by their adulterous practices. To the point that even the foreign Assyrians were to be preferred and given the guidance of the Lord to strike against his own Chosen People! We know there is a historical basis for all this, as Sennacherib, who led the Assyrians, left an inscribed clay prism, which gloated about having Hezekiah trapped “like a caged bird,” held prisoner, along with his people, in Jerusalem. Sennacherib demands that Hezekiah pay a tribute of three hundred talents of silver and thirty talents of gold which he gets from the royal treasury and the temple of Yahweh by stripping the gold off the doors and doorposts. Hezekiah acknowledges his defeat and agrees to terms which saw him released back to his own kingdom. The rest of his reign was relatively calm, and upon his death, his son, Manasseh, “Causing to Forget,” came to power, and undid all the Yahweh alone reforms of his father. During Manasseh’s reign, it is related that the prophetic authors aren’t ministering, thus the “idolatrous” king Manasseh, goes about unchallenged as he rebuilt the high places, erected an Asherah pole and reconstructed the altar to Baal. During his lengthy forty five year reign (687- 642) he also built altars to the Assyrian starry hosts, whom he bowed down to, practiced sorcery divination and consulted spiritists and mediums.

Things returned to how they had long been in the kingdom… Manasseh, can also be found in one of the more obvious inconsistencies in the Hebrew Bible narration, and which make obvious the fact that multiple authors worked on the texts. The contradiction can be found between the books of Kings and Chronicles account of the reign of Manasseh. According to the Chronicles the Assyrians invade Judah, capture Manasseh and “put a hook in his nose, bound him with bronze shackles and took him to Babylon”(2 Chronicles 33:11). While a captive, Manasseh prays to Yahweh and humbles himself. The Lord takes pity on him and he is released by the Assyrians. Upon his return to Judah, Manasseh then carries out a massive reform. He removes all the foreign idols and altars and restores the altar to Yahweh, then practices perfect monotheism for the rest of his life. “The people however continued to use the high places, but only to the Lord their God” (2 Chronicles 33:17) and accordingly Manasseh rested with his fathers after a forty-five year reign . Conversely, this whole episode from the Assyrian invasion to the repentance of Manasseh is not even mentioned in the book of Kings. To that author of Kings, Manasseh is the villain who is ultimately responsible for the destruction of the kingdom. Yet in the book of Kings Manasseh reigns for forty-five years without suffering any taste of the Lord’s anger. Moreover he dies peacefully in his own palace and is buried in his gardens, to be succeeded by his son Amon. The author doesn’t even try to rationalize this lack of action by Yahweh, but instead records the wrath of the Lord on the people as a whole for the singular sins of the king; Manasseh king of Judah has committed these detestable sins. He has done more evil than the Amorites who preceded him and has led Judah into sin with his idols. Therefore this is what the Lord, the God of Israel says: I am going to bring such disaster on Jerusalem and Judah that the ears of everyone who hears it will tingle.… I will wipe out Jerusalem as one wipes out a dish, wiping it and turning it upside-down. I will forsake the remnant of my inheritance and hand them over to their enemies. (2 Kings 21:12-14). These condemnations are echoed by the prophet Jeremiah who has Yahweh proclaim against his own Chosen People: “I will make them abhorrent to all the kingdoms of the earth because of what Manasseh son of Hezekiah king of Judah did", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634243995_cleaned.txt:138:48d4aed1b4f1", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 2088, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634243995_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634243995", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634243995_cleaned", "chunk_index": 139, "text": "who hears it will tingle.… I will wipe out Jerusalem as one wipes out a dish, wiping it and turning it upside-down.

These condemnations are echoed by the prophet Jeremiah who has Yahweh proclaim against his own Chosen People: “I will make them abhorrent to all the kingdoms of the earth because of what Manasseh son of Hezekiah king of Judah did in Jerusalem” ( Jeremiah 15:4). Interestingly, it is here with the Prophet Jeremiah, a firm Yahwehist alone reformer, where kaneh clearly falls out of favor, and through Jeremiah, Yahweh rejects offerings of kaneh, cannabis. Manasseh’s son Amon also did evil in the eyes of the Lord, following in his fathers footsteps. He reigned for only two years, (642-640), before he was assassinated by his officials. Then “the people of the land killed all who plotted against King Amon, and they made Josiah his son king in his place” (2 Kings 21:24). Josiah would sacrifice the priests of the high places, and then burn their bones upon their altars! Curiously, his reforms were justified by the alleged discovery of a book supposedly written by Moses, creator of the brazen serpent destroyed in Hezekiah’s reforms, a book that had been hidden in the Temple built by the polytheistic king Solomon. A book that seemed to address the concerns of Yahwehist prophets such as Isaiah, Micah and especially Jeremiah, who was very active and influential during Josiah’s reign. n this chapter, we will see the kaneh (cannabis) offerings of previous generations wholly rejected by Yahweh through the words of I Jeremiah. This prophet was particularly incensed at the “Queen of Heaven,” in what is generally seen as a reference to Asherah, and blames the fall of Jerusalem on her cult’s continual burning of incense and pouring out drink offerings to her. Jeremiah’s time as a prophet coincides with the reign of the most ambitious of Yahweh alone worshiping Kings, Josiah, the grandson of Hezekiah. Although a number of scholars have suggested that the tel Arad temple was canceled during Hezekiah’s reign, others have suggested this coincides with Josiah’s reforms, which were directed at removing all remnants of the High Places, the incense altars, all competing deities, and any temple outside of the main temple in Jerusalem. Josiah became king when he was just eight years old. It was during his reign that one of the greatest frauds in history was perpetrated. The repercussions from what was an early case of perjury went vastly beyond the scope of those who committed the crime and are still with us today, as it has had a profoundly formative influence on history.

The narrative of 2 Kings recalls that in the eighteenth year of his reign, Josiah ordered some renovations to the temple of Yahweh. He tells one Shaphan the scribe to go to Hilkiah the high priest and carry out these repairs. During the course of this work a startling discovery is made: “Hilkiah the high priest said to Shaphan the secretary, ‘I have found the Book of the Law in the temple of the Lord’” (2 Kings 22:8). This lost “Book of the Law” is none other than the book of Deuteronomy, that allegedly had been written by Moses some six hundred years earlier. “This sacred text was not surprisingly, completely responsive to the prophetic tradition of Hosea, Amos, Isaiah, Micah, and especially Jeremiah, who was alive and at work when this new book was ‘discovered’” (Spong 1991). That this fifth book of Moses is mysteriously unearthed from the temple is extremely curious, as the temple wasn’t constructed until the reign of Solomon and no mention of it had heretofore ever been made. To ascribe this book’s authorship to Moses raises some problems. It is known that the culture of the Hebrews was an oral tradition not to be committed to the written word until approximately the time of David. Up to this time, most religious writing appeared as poetry or song, very little prose is known. In fact, by the style of writing in Deuteronomy, Biblical scholars have placed the text at a much later date of composition. “This new literary style, found in the Deuteronomic literature and the prose sections of Jeremiah, seems to have been characteristic of the late seventh and early sixth centuries B.C.”(Anderson 1975). The very time of the alleged “discovery.” Anderson suggests that the Book of the Law was written by an anonymous author in the seventh century who put his own words in the mouth of Moses; although he also felt that the work was “not a complete literary fiction …. [and] is essentially a revival of Mosaic teachings as it was understood in the seventh century B.C.” (Anderson 1975). Other scholars have been far more hard-hitting in their comments upon this so-called discovery suggesting that it was a forgery created by a Jerusalem lawyer and produced by a priest of the temple, an act committed by the Hebrew priesthood in hope of eradicating the competing cults and their deities, which were getting more sacrifices from the people than was the Temple of Yahweh.

Sometime about 630, when Assyria was losing her grip, a lawyer in Jerusalem produced a new code as a program for future reforms, including the prohibition of the worship of gods other than Yahweh, and relief of the poor. He drew on older “Yahweh alone” traditions, common usage, and ancient taboos, but his work was organized by his own thought, replete with his own invention, and cast with his own style. He represented it as “the law of Yahweh” and – probably – as the work of Moses, and he arranged to have it “found” by the high priest in the Jerusalem temple in 621. It was taken to king Josiah, authenticated by a prophetess, and accepted. Most of it is now preserved, with minor interpolations, in chapters 12-26 and 28 of Deuteronomy. (Garraty & Gay, 1981) The high priest Hilkiah (Portion of Jah), the scribe Shaphan (Conceal) and the cabal they founded, play a pivotal role in the conspiracy about to unfold. Considering Deuteronomy’s nature and focus on strict patriarchal monotheistic forms of worship, it is interesting to note that the book was taken for verification “neither to a prophet or to a priest, but to a prophetess to learn the judgment of their god” (Campbell 1964). The prophetess Huldah, whose name aptly comes from the feminine word for “weasel,” seals the doom of her sisters for millennia afterwards by verifying the newly “discovered” book as authentic. Thus the strictures of the sharp-toothed Book of Deuteronomy were passed into the realm of Divine Edict as the words of Moses, a figure of mythical status who was believed to have lived more than six hundred years earlier and who was used to justify the book’s recently composed strict monotheistic codes. In the Talmud it is stated that Huldah was a relative of the prophet Jeremiah, (both depicted as descendants of Joshua, who accompanied Moses). Jeremiah’s role in the monotheistic take-over that is about to befall Jerusalem, cannot be understated. The prophet Jeremiah (Jah will rise) is worthy of careful consideration not only for the drama and color with which he ministered his prophetic role, but also for the blood ties that bound him in with the families that had perpetrated the great counterfeit of ancient Judaic history: the “Book of the Law.” Jeremiah was the son of Hilkiah, this is the same name of the high priest who “discovered” the Book of the Law.

His allegiance with the sons of Shaphan, Hilkaiah’s cohort, also run through his writings with a striking frequency and reveal the influence they were still exerting for the propagation of their monotheistic worldview. As archaeological evidence shows, and the Hebrew Bible writings themselves indicate, up “…until the eighteenth year of the reign of King Josiah of Judah neither kings nor people had paid attention whatsoever to the law of Moses which, indeed, they had not even known. They had been devoted to the normal deities of the nuclear Near East, with all the usual cults…”(Campbell 1964). Until the “discovery” of the Book of the Law, the “Hebrew people worshiped in the old ways, practicing their cult in open places on peaks and hills and mountains, and even caves below” (Gadon 1989). Clearly, monotheistic Judaism was a new event, and an attempt at a combined religious and political movement to consolidate the Hebrew people under one rule. In some ways an understandable political view in light of the encroaching Assyrians. This act was also directed at ensuring all temple offerings were allocated to the main temple in Jerusalem. Considering the harsh reforms that are to be initiated by the Book of the Laws discovery, it is extremely curious to note that the last great Judaic reformer was Josiah’s grandfather, Hezekiah, and he was said to have destroyed the brazen serpent made by Moses (2 Kings 18:4). Yet this same Moses, the maker of a graven image, is reputedly the author of the book that brings the harshest monotheistic religious reforms in Hebrew history and the ancient narrator of Kings never even tries to account for this blatant contradiction. The contents of the book of Deuteronomy clearly betray its more recent authorship. (1) The destruction and removal of all other cult objects pertaining to the “other gods” worshiped in the region and burning them in the Kidron Valley. (2) The murder and suppression of the competing priesthoods who were installed by the previous kings of Judah to serve the astral deities, and who had served at shrines all over the kingdom.

(3) The burning and destruction of the images of the Asherah and scattering their dust in unclean places (i.e., burial ground) (4) The centralization and confinement of worship to the temple of Yahweh in Jerusalem alone. There are a number of laws in Deuteronomy that testify to its new theology. The most extraordinary of these changes is the centralization of worship: “you are to seek the place the Lord your God will choose from among all your tribes to put his name there for his dwelling. To that place you must go; there bring your burnt offerings and sacrifices, your tithes and special gifts” (Deuteronomy 12:5-6). The tribes of Israel are being directed to use the temple in Jerusalem alone for their principle sacrifices, other generations old places of worship are to be destroyed. They are no longer to make burnt offerings or sacrifices anywhere in Israel except for the Temple in Jerusalem. All tithes also are to be brought from throughout the kingdom to the main Temple. All this was directed by the Jerusalem priesthood, who had their own motivation to see competing temples destroyed and banned, and a “Yahweh alone” a religio/politico monopoly instilled in their place. As Joseph Gutmann explained in No Graven Images: Studies in Art and the Hebrew Bible: “Josiah … apparently at the insistence of the Jerusalem priesthood, on whom he may have depended for support and who no doubt lost prestige – and tithes when many sacrifices were diverted to the numerous “high places,” insisted on the centrality of worship. To accomplish this end, an unwavering affirmation of Yahweh’s exclusiveness and the centrality of the Yahweh cult was necessary; all attempts to decentralize the cult and to worship other gods had, of course, to be eliminated” (Gutmann, 1971). Prior to the Deuteronomic reforms, the priests of Yahweh’s temple had to angrily and jealously sit by and watch the wealth of the kingdom dispersed throughout the many different temples of numerous deities which were spread throughout Judah. Thus the lament in Isaiah 43:23-24 about the lack of kaneh (cannabis) offerings. There is more : “You must not eat in your towns the tithe of your grain and new wine and oil, or the firstborn of your herds and flocks…” (Deuteronomy 12:17). This of course adds up to a profound amount of booty. It is all to be brought conveniently to the temple in Jerusalem. Jerusalem had, not long before, undergone a siege from the Assyrians while under the reign of Hezekiah.

Thus it is no surprise that those living within the city walls should want to lay up as much food as possible. Especially when one considers the political situation that Israel was facing. At this time, Assyria, the undisputed superpower in the region for the past several centuries, had gone into decline and the Babylonians (Chaldeans) from the south of Mesopotamia had come into power. Nabopolassar (626-605 B.C.) was expanding the Babylonian empire and threatening all the small nations of the Fertile Crescent, and these invasions play a decisive part in the drama about to unfold. As noted the forgery of the Book of the Law may have been done with good reason, likely in an attempt to politically consolidate the fragmented populace of the Southern Kingdom into a united force with similar goals and beliefs, in front of an ever-changing onslaught of invading kingdoms. It is believed that around this same time period, many of the books of the Hebrew Bible were edited and added to. As Bishop John Shelby Spong explained: “By the time the Deuteronomists had finished their work they had colored the books of Joshua, Judges,1 and 2 Samuel and 1 and 2 Kings. They had supplied their nation with a philosophy of history, and they had touched up the books of the prophets. They had taught the Jewish people to see the past through their eyes” (Spong 1991). Most notable of the many effects rendered by the book’s supposed “discovery” were Josiah’s murderous purge of the cults of the high places. The book of Deuteronomy is explicit in its instructions of how best to deal with all the religious worship going on in Judah, other than the centralized worship of Yahweh in the temple in Jerusalem: “Destroy completely all the places on the high mountains and on the hills and under every spreading tree where the nations you are dispossessing worship their gods. Break down their altars, smash their sacred stones and burn their Asherah poles in the fire, cut down the idols of their gods and wipe out their names from those places” (Deuteronomy 12:2-3). The Hebrew Scriptures regularly pair Asherah’s name, especially “the asherahs,” with Baal’s, so that some scholars have wondered whether Asherah had ousted Astarte as Baal’s consort. In 1963 Yamashita noted that most of the references to Asherah in the Hebrew Bible, including those pairing Asherah with Baal, were associated with only one source (1963:123-137). Later, Olyan argued very convincingly that the biblical attacks on Asherah were “restricted to the Deuteronomistic History” and to texts exhibiting Deuteronomistic influence. For instance, the numerous pairings of Baal with Asherah’s “cult symbol,” called “the asherah,” are part", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634243995_cleaned.txt:144:70945e7d7d9c", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 2094, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634243995_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634243995", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634243995_cleaned", "chunk_index": 145, "text": "that some scholars have wondered whether Asherah had ousted Astarte as Baal’s consort.

Later, Olyan argued very convincingly that the biblical attacks on Asherah were “restricted to the Deuteronomistic History” and to texts exhibiting Deuteronomistic influence. For instance, the numerous pairings of Baal with Asherah’s “cult symbol,” called “the asherah,” are part of a reformist, monotheistic “anti-asherah polemic” aimed at discrediting “the asherah” by associating it with “Baal and Astarte” (Olyan 1988…). This polemic was necessary because Asherah “had some role in the cult of Yahweh … not only in popular Yahwism, but in the official cult as well (Olyan 1988:74)(Stuckey, 2004). As the authors of 2 Kings record, when Josiah discovers the new laws he is horrified. “Great is the Lord’s anger that burns against us because our fathers have not obeyed the words of this book; they have not acted in accordance with all that is written there concerning us” (2 Kings 22:13). The Israelites weren’t able to obey the strict edicts, as the book (written by a maker of brazen images) had never even been read before, as it had been reputedly entombed somewhere in the depths of a temple (built by a polytheistic king). King Josiah took immediate action obeying completely the severe dictates of the law and went about the land removing the altars of the various gods and goddesses being worshiped by the Israelites. The text goes into some detail concerning the violence unleashed by the king, beginning with reforms in the Temple of Jerusalem itself, the home of much pagan worship and where ironically the “new” book was found. It is from the description of Josiah’s reform that we receive a clearer idea of what the actual religion of the Judaic peoples was like: And the king commanded Hilkiah high priest … to bring forth out of the Temple of the Lord all the vessels that were made for Baal and for Ashera, and for all the hosts of heaven. He burned them outside Jerusalem in the fields … and took the ashes to Beth-El. He did away with the pagan priests appointed by the kings of Judah to burn incense on the high places of the towns of Judah and on those around Jerusalem–those who burned incense to Baal, to the sun and the moon, to the constellations of the starry hosts. He took the Asherah pole from the temple of the Lord to the Kidron Valley outside Jerusalem and burned it there. He ground it to powder and scattered the dust over the graves of the common people. He also tore down the quarters of the male shrine-prostitutes which were in the temple of the Lord and where woman did weaving for Asherah.", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634243995_cleaned.txt:145:155ac92b0bbf", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 2095, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634243995_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634243995", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634243995_cleaned", "chunk_index": 146, "text": "who burned incense to Baal, to the sun and the moon, to the constellations of the starry hosts.

He also tore down the quarters of the male shrine-prostitutes which were in the temple of the Lord and where woman did weaving for Asherah. He pulled down the altars the kings of Judah had erected on the roof near the upper room of Ahaz, and the altars Manasseh had built in the two courts of the temple of the Lord.… The king also desecrated the high places that were east of Jerusalem on the south of the hill of Corruption – the ones Solomon the king of Israel had built for Ashtoreth the vile goddess of the Sidonians, for Chemosh the vile god of Moab, and for Molech the detestable god of … Ammon. Josiah smashed the sacred stones and cut down the Ashera poles and covered the site with human bones. Even at the altar of Beth-El, the high places made by Jeroboam … who caused Israel to sin – even that altar and high place he demolished. He burned the high place and ground it to powder, and burned the Asherah pole also. Then Josiah looked around when he saw the tombs that were on the hill side, he had the bones removed from them and burned on the altar to defile it… Just as he had done in Beth-El, Josiah removed and defiled all the shrines at the high places that the kings of Israel had built in the towns of Samaria that had provoked the Lord to anger. Josiah slaughtered all the priests of those high places on the altars and burned human bones on them (2 Kings 23:4-20). The bloodthirsty reforms carried out by Josiah were taken throughout the land and right into the temple in Jerusalem. The description of all the various cults that were being practiced in the central sanctuary in Jerusalem reveals the full extent that the Israelites had become syncretistic with Canaanite and Near Eastern religion. We learn that not only were there male and female shrine prostitutes in Israel, but they were even living and practicing in the temple of the Lord itself! Further we learn that the adulterous religious sites made by Solomon and other Kings had still been standing throughout the many intervening centuries. Also of interest is the condemnation of the burning of “incense,” Josiah “did away with all the pagan priests appointed by the kings of Judah to burn incense on the high places around Jerusalem” (2 Kings 23:5).

Here for the first time the death penalty is exacted for the burning of incense. That these were “pagan” priests indicates that they were practicing Canaanite religion. 2 Kings says of Josiah’s actions: “This he did to fulfill the requirements of the law written in the book that Hilkiah the priest had discovered in the temple of the Lord” (2 Kings 23:24). The Hebrew Bible is very pleased with the king for this appalling display of righteous violence. In fact Josiah has gone down in history as one of the few good kings of Israel. “Neither before nor after Josiah was there a king like him who turned to the Lord as he did – with all his heart and with all his soul and with all his strength, in accordance with all the Law of Moses” (2 Kings 23:25). Upon his return to Jerusalem he commanded the surviving people: “Celebrate the Passover to the Lord your God, as it is written in this Book of the Covenant” (2 Kings 23:21). A request, which after witnessing the results of Josiah’s homicidal purging, the Hebrew populace were only too eager to comply with. The festival of Passover itself was not new, this had been the date of a longstanding agricultural festival; tying it with the Exodus of Moses, however, was new. Indeed, most archaeologists and many biblical historians see little evidence of the Mosaic past prior to these events. The adoption of these agricultural festivals, which would surely have been bound up with polytheistic beliefs and practices, is comparable to the later adoption of December 25th, originally celebrated for the sun god Sol, and Mithras, as Christmas and the birthdate of Jesus sometime around the 4th century, after Christianity had become a State Religion in a similar bid for consolidation and power. Josiah’s reforms were only possible because the Assyrians were losing control of their provinces. The changes made by Josiah as he carried out the commands of the newly found Book of the Law included removing Assyrian altars, idols and practices from the temple as well as throughout Judah. During the height of Assyrian power this move would have prompted the immediate retribution of the Assyrian military. We saw this with Hezekiah.

Dr. Raphael Mechoulam has suggested that it was at this juncture a ban on cannabis was instilled: While most Scythians were only temporary visitors to the Middle East, the Assyrians were one of the major military powers in the area for hundreds of years and their influence was powerful. As mentioned above, the Assyrians employed cannabis, apparently quite extensively. The contacts between the Jews and the Assyrians were prolonged and wide. During certain historical periods the trade of Judea depended on Assyria; the cultural-religious impact of the Nineveh court and temples penetrated not only the royal and priestly class in Jerusalem but also the lower classes. Gradually in the 7th century B.C. even the Assyrian cult of heavenly constellations was adopted; the ancient forms of augury were revived; in the Temple itself an image of the Assyrian”queen of heaven” was erected; within the Temple young women offered their bodies in honor of the deity. During the reigns of the Assyrian kings Esarhaddon (681-669 B.C.) and Ashurbanipal (669-626 B.C.), the Jewish King Manasseh, who was their vassal, fought beside them in their wars with Egypt and probably also in Transjordan in order to secure the commercial roads for drugs and spices. The influence of the kings of Nineveh (“the bloody city, full of lies and robbery”) in Judea was immense. It can be assumed that under these conditions Assyrian medicine and drugs were known and used, at least among the ruling class. After the death of Ashurbanipal the decadent and hedonistic kingdom of Assyria swiftly disappeared from history. The Jewish King Josiah (628 B.Cn.) is known to have taken advantage of the Assyrian decay to remove vigorously all pagan influence from Jewish life and religious customs. Hashish, presumably a symbol of Assyrian moralaxity, would have been banned. This is, of course, an assumption but it fits the historical background, the insular character of the Jews at the time, and the needs of the independent Judaean state. It explains the strange absence of the word cannabis in the Bible (Mechoulam, 1986). As noted in Chapter 4, Mechoulam doubted the etymology of kaneh bosm, and instead suggested the term pannagh, which appears only once in the Hebrew Bible, in a later reference from Ezekiel, and arriving in a caravan. The references to kaneh and kaneh bosm from Yahwist and Deuteronomist writers, do not actually portray it in a negative light.

The references to kaneh and kaneh bosm from Yahwist and Deuteronomist writers, do not actually portray it in a negative light. It was clearly listed as an important ritual commodity in the Exodus, Isaiah and Songs references. As we shall see, this rejection came shortly after this through the prophet Jeremiah, who did however list its foreign source as an indication of something of disdain, but more pointedly, its association with the “Queen of Heaven.” Interestingly, descriptions in the Babylonian Talmud: Tractate Horayoth, Folio 12, indicate that the anointing oil was hidden away in the days of Josiah, with the Ark of the Covenant and as a result his son, Jehoahaz was anointed with balsam oil, not with the Holy anointing oil: “… At the time when the Holy Ark was hidden away there were also hidden the anointing oil… And who hid them? It was Josiah, King of Judah, who hid them; because, having observed that it was written in the Torah, The Lord will bring thee and thy king … [unto a nation that thou hast not known], he gave orders that they shall be hidden away, as it is said, And he said unto the Levites that taught all Israel, that were holy unto the Lord, “Put the Holy Ark into the house which Solomon the son of David, King of Israel, did build; there shall no more be a burden upon your shoulders.” As it was supposedly the worship of foreign gods that caused Yahweh to destroy so much of the kingdom, and Josiah’s reforms purged the land of these rites, it is curious the narrative next comes up with the following statement: “Never the less the Lord did not turn away from the heat of his fierce anger, which burned against Judah because of all that Manasseh had done to provoke him to anger. So the Lord said. ‘I will remove Judah also from my presence as I removed Israel, and I will reject Jerusalem, the city I chose, and this temple, about which I said ‘There will my name be’”(2 Kings 23:27). What we see here, is the retrospective Yahwehist author, trying to make historical reality fit with the supposed actions of a Lord, who should have logically rewarded the severe reforms in his favor.

Old Yahweh does not inspire much confidence in his sense of justice if his most devoted king does not receive the benefits of his obedience but instead meets such an ignominious end. As a result of the loss of Josiah’s patriarchal leadership, within a scant forty years Judah would once again have “as many gods as you have towns.” Such Pagan activities causes the prophet Jeremiah, who begins to play a pivotal role at this time, to condemn the Israelites by pointing out that: “the altars you have set up to burn incense to that shameful god Baal are as many as the streets of Jerusalem” ( Jeremiah 11:13). Clearly, this was the preferred form of worship, and the Deuteronomic code was forced upon a pagan people, in much the same way as the Bible has been forced upon the aboriginal peoples of today’s world. Apparently Josiah’s “defeat seems to have been taken as proof of the error of his ways; the later prophecies of Jeremiah and Ezekiel show polytheism back in practice” (Bickerman & Smith, 1976). The burning of “incense” and worshiping the Queen of heaven continued as well. Hear, O earth! I am bringing disaster on this people, the fruit of their own schemes, because they have paid no attention to My word and have rejected My instruction. What use to Me is frankincense from Sheba or sweet [smelling] cane [kaneh-cannabis] from a distant land? Your burnt offerings are not acceptable; your sacrifices do not please Me ( Jeremiah 6:19-20). Clearly it is in the harsh reforms of Josiah and the words of the Lord through Jeremiah that the ritual use of cannabis fell out of favor with the Israelite priesthood, and the modern monotheistic form of Judaic worship had its forced inception. Apparently, the use of cannabis had become so associated with the pagan worship practiced throughout Jerusalem that despite its earlier popularity with the Hebrews, its sacramental use was now seen as unreformable and the burning of kaneh, for prophetic trances, had become associated with pagan worship. Jeremiah seems to have been at first a full supporter of the edicts of the newly discovered Deuteronomic code, even walking the streets preaching for its acceptance ( Jeremiah 11:1-13), and exalting Josiah for his fanatical reforms ( Jeremiah 22:15-16). But in later times, he came to reject it, seeing that it failed in its purpose of bringing the people to true repentance, “but yielded only a defiant nationalism and an external piety” (Anderson 1975).

But in later times, he came to reject it, seeing that it failed in its purpose of bringing the people to true repentance, “but yielded only a defiant nationalism and an external piety” (Anderson 1975). Believing, like all religious fanatics, that only he knew the way, Jeremiah separated himself somewhat from the Deuteronomic conspirators, proclaiming, likely in reference to the forgery of Deuteronomy itself; “How can you say, ‘We are wise, and the law of Yahweh is with us’? But, behold, the false pen of the scribes has made it a lie” ( Jeremiah 8:8). Jeremiah 14:14, indicates no prophet but Jeremiah should be heeded: “The prophets are prophesying lies in my name; I did not send them. They are prophesying to you a lying vision, worthless divination, and the deceit of their own minds.” Sentiments repeated in Jeremiah 8:10: “…From prophet to priest everyone deals falsely”; “…Elders and dignitaries are the head, and prophets who teach lies are the tail; for those who led this people led them astray” ( Jeremiah 6:13); “See, therefore, I am against the prophets, says the Lord, who steal my words from one another, who use their own tongues and say ‘Says the Lord,” against those who prophesy lying dreams” ( Jeremiah 23:30-32). Jeremiah himself was much less of an ecstatic, shamanic prophet, and much more of a diviner. Unlike other prophets, it would seem that Jeremiah had the peculiar habit of divining meanings from otherwise ordinary events, and interpreting them as messages from the Lord: A boiled over cauldron, signifies trouble brewing from the northern Babylonians; Watching a potter at work, Jeremiah deciphered that Israel was like potters clay in the hands of Yahweh, if the shape failed to take hold, it could be destroyed and reworked; After buying a linen waist-cloth and leaving it on some rocks, upon rediscovering it Jeremiah concluded that Yahweh would spoil the adulterous pride of the people, although at one time he had clung to them like a garment.1 Another one of the characteristics that distinguish the sullen prophet Jeremiah, from all other biblical prophets “is the large number of confessions and references to his personal feelings” (Eliade 1978). He “complains about his lot, cries out for vindication, and even hurls defiance at God … shadowed by doubt … self pity, and despair” (Anderson 1975). No one felt more sorry for Jeremiah than himself, as can be seen by his constant complaints to the Lord; “Alas, my mother that you gave me birth, a man with whom the whole land strives and contends! … everyone curses me … I sat alone, because thy hand was upon", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634243995_cleaned.txt:151:c5da651a438f", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 2101, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634243995_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634243995", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634243995_cleaned", "chunk_index": 152, "text": "feelings” (Eliade 1978).

Indeed, morose Jeremiah’s resentment could be seen to have led him to mistake his own harsh judgment of others, for the judgment of the Lord himself! A hypothesis demonstrated in the words of the dour prophet himself, who angrily goes so far as to question even the Lord’s own judgment; “Why is it that the wicked live so prosperously? Why do scoundrels enjoy peace?”( Jeremiah 12:1). Indeed, why? Jeremiah also confesses to being driven to such a point of frustration, that “I smote upon my thigh”( Jeremiah 31:19). As it has long been noted that “thigh” is a Biblical euphemism for genitals, it is interesting to note that there is a longstanding tradition that Jeremiah, who never married, was notoriously known for his own self stimulation! “The prophet Jeremiah laments his having been made a sahuq, a compulsive masturbator, repeatedly abused by all of his oppressors. He even styles himself a contemptible sahuq (jerk-off) to his own people…” (Edwardes 1967). ehoahaz, (Jehova-seized 609 B.C.) Josiah’s son, is anointed king “by the people of the land” but he reigns for only three months. He then does evil in the Lord’s sight, i.e. returning to the traditional Semitic-pagan religion, that existed prior to his father’s radical reforms and their exhalation of the monotheistic cult of Yahweh. Reference indicating the widespread nature of such activities can be found in the condemnations and warnings of Jeremiah: “The towns of Judah and the people of Jerusalem will go and cry out to the gods to whom they burn incense.… You have as many gods as you have towns, O Judah; and the altars you have set up to burn incense to that shameful god Baal are as many as the streets of Jerusalem” ( Jeremiah 11:12-13). “The covenant has been broken!” wails Jeremiah, “I brought on them all the curses of the covenant I had commanded them to follow but that they did not keep” ( Jeremiah 11:8). Jeremiah also gives us much detail concerning the continuing cult of Asherah, (or her daughter counterparts Astarte, or Anath, as the text", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634243995_cleaned.txt:152:ee21c48a00dc", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 2102, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634243995_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634243995", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634243995_cleaned", "chunk_index": 153, "text": "and the altars you have set up to burn incense to that shameful god Baal are as many as the streets of Jerusalem” ( Jeremiah 11:12-13). “The covenant has been broken!” wails Jeremiah, “I brought on them all the curses of the covenant I had commanded them to follow but that they did not keep” ( Jeremiah 11:8). Jeremiah also gives us much detail concerning the continuing cult of Asherah, (or her daughter counterparts Astarte, or Anath, as the text is unclear on this point) who by this time is generally referred to as the Queen of Heaven. It is through the writings of Jeremiah that we can see just how interwoven with Hebrew culture the worship of the Goddess was. The judgmental prophet’s first references to it give us a clear indication that the Queen of Heaven was being worshiped in sexual rites: “Indeed on every high hill and under every spreading tree you lay down as a prostitute” ( Jeremiah 2:20). Jeremiah describes the lust of Judah in lurid tones, and like Hosea, Isaiah, and other prophets refers to the pagan worship of the Judahites, in the terms of a husband to his adulterous wife. Many indication of Asherah worship we have discussed can also be see in these passages from Hosea 2; Asherah pendants; ritual prostitution; weaved garments; offerings of incenses and oils not making it to Yahweh etc: Calling the kingdom of Judah a she-camel and a wild donkey in heat, the angry prophet Jeremiah states: “Any males that pursue her need not tire themselves, at mating time they will find her” ( Jeremiah 2:24 ). Jeremiah’s further rantings against the kingdom give clear indication why there is little reverence for women in his life: “I will pull your skirts over your face that your shame may be seen – your adulteries and your lustful neighings, your shameless prostitution.” ( Jeremiah 13:26-27). Jeremiah expresses in some detail the rites of the goddess. He describes how the whole family took part in the worship: “Do you not know what they are doing in the towns of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem. The children gather wood, the fathers light the fire and the women knead the dough and make cakes of bread for the Queen of Heaven” ( Jeremiah 7:17). The reference to “cakes” here is interesting, as Kitto’s suggestion of a cannabis resin product, or syrup, eshisha, noted in Chapter 4, occurs in reference to “sweet cakes.” Eshisha appears in The Song of Songs, which we looked at for its evidence of the Sacred Marriage between Asherah and Yahweh, as well as in Hosea, where they are condemned in a likely reference to their use in the Asherah cult, “they turn to other gods and love the sacred raisin cakes eshisha” (Hosea 3:1).

In Charles Ellicott’s An Old Testament Commentary for English Readers, these are described as “the luscious sacrificial cakes used in idolatrous worship: a term generally descriptive of the licentious accompaniments of the Ashtoreth worship” (Ellicott, 1884). The Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges (1882) noted: The cakes here mentioned … must have been of a superior kind; they bear a different name, eshisha and appear from Isaiah 16:7 … to have been considered as luxuries. They formed part of David’s royal bounty on the removal of the ark to Jerusalem (2 Samuel 6:19), or more correctly of the sacrificial feast implied by the context. This latter point is interesting as it suggests that Baal-worship was closely related to the festivities of the vintage (Prof. Robertson Smith, The Old Testament in the Jewish Church, p. 434). Hosea too seems to refer to these cakes in connection with the sacrificial feasts, not without a touch of sarcasm (Perowne, 1882). The reference to eshisha, in the context of 2 Samuel 6:19, is comparable to the use of the shewbread in the temple, and this is what John Perowne is indicating above.2 Perhaps like kaneh, which was used in the Holy of Holies, and then later condemned for its association with pagan worship, we can see a similar situation with the formerly celebrated and then condemned eshisha? And within this a connection between the shewbread of the main temple and the cakes offered to the Queen of Heaven? Jeremiah clearly marks Asherah as the main culprit of blame for the doom of Jerusalem: “The sin of Judah is written with an iron stylus, engraved with a diamond point on the tablets of their hearts and on the horns of their altars. Even their children remember their altars and Asherah poles by the green trees and on the high hills. My mountain in the land and your wealth and all your treasures, I will give away as plunder, together with your high places, because of sin throughout your country” ( Jeremiah 17:1-3). Altars, which we now know through the findings at tel Arad, where upon cannabis was once burned to Asherah. It is over this issue that Jeremiah has Yahweh reject completely the cannabis offerings of previous generations. “What use to me is frankincense that comes from Sheba, or sweet cane [kaneh - cannabis] from a distant land? Your burnt offerings are not acceptable, nor your sacrifices pleasing to me” ( Jeremiah 6:20).

Your burnt offerings are not acceptable, nor your sacrifices pleasing to me” ( Jeremiah 6:20). Clearly, up until this time, hemp had been an integral and popular part of mainstream Judaic worship, as practiced by the people of the land. Jeremiah’s prohibitions against it in the name of the Lord were seen by the populace as the empty words of a pseudo-prophet. Important to note here, Frankincense and cannabis are specifically identified in this passage, and these are the exact items that were found on the two altars at the canceled Holy of Holies in the tel Arad temple. We have noted that both kaneh and frankincense appear together in the Isaiah 43:24 and Song of Songs 4:14 references as well. I would argue, these references particularly secure and prove Sula Benet’s etymological theories that the Hebrew kaneh bosm and kaneh references identified cannabis. The appearance of kaneh alongside frankincense in these references shows that kaneh is “cannabis” as this is the combination recovered in the temple at tel Arad. The indications of the combined worship of Yahweh and Asherah taking place in tel Arad is also further confirmation for Robert Graves claim of ritual cannabis use by the cult of Asherah, as are these condemnations of kaneh and frankincense in Jeremiah 6:20. zekiel begins his own prophetic mission around this time, and it Eis in his account we find our final reference to kaneh as cannabis. The final Biblical reference to kaneh appears in Ezekiel 27, in a passage called “A Lament for Tyre.” Judah and the kingdom of Tyre had fallen into disfavor with Yahweh, and cannabis appears as just one of many of the wares received by Tyre, the merchant of peoples on many coasts: “Because of your many products and your great wealth of goods, Damascus traded with you wine from Helbon, wool from Zahar, and casks of wine from Izal for your wares. Wrought iron, cassia, and sweet cane [kaneh] were exchanged for your merchandise”(Ezekiel 27:18-19). As with Jeremiah 6:20, this indicates that cannabis came to the Israelites as an item of trade, this was also the view in regard to the source of the cannabis and frankincense recovered from the tel Arad temple. “You… took the fine jewelry of gold and silver I had given you, and you made male idols with which to prostitute yourself. You took your embroidered garments to cover them, and you set My oil and incense before them. Also My food which I gave you – the pastry", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634243995_cleaned.txt:155:24fca23c5603", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 2105, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634243995_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634243995", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634243995_cleaned", "chunk_index": 156, "text": "came to the Israelites as an item of trade, this was also the view in regard to the source of the cannabis and frankincense recovered from the tel Arad temple. “You… took the fine jewelry of gold and silver I had given you, and you made male idols with which to prostitute yourself. You took your embroidered garments to cover them, and you set My oil and incense before them. Also My food which I gave you – the pastry of fine flour, oil, and honey which I fed you – you set it before them as sweet incense; and so it was,” says the Lord GOD (Ezekiel 16-19). “Embroidered garments,” is a likely reference to the sacred weaving done in the temple by the worshipers of Asherah. In Ezekiel and the World of Deuteronomy, Jason Gile notes that “Many scholars have identified Ezekiel’s image of jealousy [(Ezekiel 8:5)] with Asherah, particularly the ‘statue of Asherah’ set up by Manasseh in the Jerusalem temple (2Kgs 2 : 17)^(𝔫) (Gile, 2021). Indications in Ezekiel, Isaiah, and even Jeremiah as well as Hosea are that, still at this time, monotheism was not in place. Even those prophets themselves were not monotheists in the sense that they believed there was only one god, but rather they acknowledged the existence of these other deities, while preaching that it was Yahweh alone who should receive offerings and be worshiped by the Hebrews, his “Chosen People.” Again like Isaiah, there are indications that although complaining about not receiving the Lord’s due of the sacrament, there was occasion where they were provided. Although unlike Isaiah’s inhalation of an incense coal from the altar held in tongs to his lips, Ezekiel seems to have ingested an entheogenic preparation. The ingestion here occurs just before Ezekiel’s famous apocalyptic vision which took place in Babylon, shortly after the period we have been discussing, during the Exile. Ezekiel 3 describes this shamanistic scenario perfectly, as well as describing the ingestion of the unknown entheogen to initiate the shamanistic flight. The ancient prophet tells us that the Lord told him: Son of man, eat what is before you, eat this scroll; then go and speak to the house of Israel.” So I opened my mouth and he gave me the scroll to eat.… So I ate it, and it tasted as sweet as honey in my mouth.… Then the Spirit lifted me up, and I heard behind me a loud rumbling sound – May the glory of the Lord be praised in his dwelling-place! – the sound of the wings of the living creatures brushing against each other and the sound of the wheels beside them, a loud rumbling sound. The Spirit then lifted me up and took me away… (Ezekiel 3:4-14). …In the first chapter of Ezekiel a phantasmagoria of composite creatures, of wheels, and of brilliant play of colors, which", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634243995_cleaned.txt:156:cb76441af671", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 2106, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634243995_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634243995", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634243995_cleaned", "chunk_index": 157, "text": "up, and I heard behind me a loud rumbling sound – May the glory of the Lord be praised in his dwelling-place! – the sound of the wings of the living creatures brushing against each other and the sound of the wheels beside them, a loud rumbling sound.

This is the chapter of Ezekiel that gave so much trouble to the ancient canonists, and is said to have made them hesitate about including the book. Ezekiel was included in the Canon, but with the instruction that no one in the Synagogue was to attempt to comment upon Chapter I, or, according to another version, that the opening chapter was not to be read by or to persons under a certain age. The subjective sensations stimulated by hachish are those of sight and hearing. It would be easy to quote examples of fantastic composite form, and of wondrous colors, which have been seen by experimenters (Creighton, 1903). And by the edge of the river, on this side and on that, will come up every tree used for food, whose leaves will ever be green and its fruit will not come to an end: it will have new fruit every month, because its waters come out from the holy place: the fruit will be for food and the leaf will make well those who are ill (Ezekiel 47:12). Although the above verse reference refers to a variety of “trees,” it seems that in Ezekiel there was also concern for one particular plant as well, as can be seen in this quote often referred to by Rastafarians and other cannabis using Biblical influenced groups: “And I will raise up for them a plant of renown, and they shall be no more consumed with hunger in the land, neither bear the shame of the heathen any more” (Ezekiel 34:29). As Ezekiel’s vision occurred in Babylon during the Exile, it is not surprising that the beasts he saw in his vision bear a marked resemblance to those depicted in surviving Babylonian art, and these are connected with Assyrian “Tree of Life” images that may have influenced Ezekiel’s reference to a sacred tree. This may also play a role in the Eden mythology as well, as it is believed that the story of Adam and Eve was contrived around this same time. As the 19th century scholar and archaeologist Austen Henry Layard noted, the four creatures most often depicted in sculptures accompanying that of the sacred Assyrian Tree of Life, were “a man, a lion, an ox, and an eagle” (Layard 1856).", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634243995_cleaned.txt:157:250ce3da613d", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 2107, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634243995_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634243995", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634243995_cleaned", "chunk_index": 158, "text": "images that may have influenced Ezekiel’s reference to a sacred tree.

As the 19th century scholar and archaeologist Austen Henry Layard noted, the four creatures most often depicted in sculptures accompanying that of the sacred Assyrian Tree of Life, were “a man, a lion, an ox, and an eagle” (Layard 1856). Babylon was the origin and heart of the initiation mysteries that took place all over the ancient world, thus it became a symbol of idolatrous worship in the Bible. As part of their complicated rituals, these initiation rites used props to create sounds which represented things such as large wings flapping rapidly, accompanied by fierce animal noises in the background. These shamanistic rites were performed in elaborately decorated, smoke filled temples by participants wearing masks and costumes that represented both real and imaginary beasts. A scenario that fits well with the account described in Ezekiel 3. As well, we can be sure that as with the Assyrian Sacred Rites, entheogens were likely liberally employed in such rituals. An ancient Babylonian inscription reads: “The glorious gods smell the incense, noble food of heaven; pure wine, which no hand has touched do they enjoy.” In Myths of Babylonia and Assyria, Donald Mackenzie suggested that in Babylonian religious rites, “inspiration was derived by burning incense, which, if we follow evidence obtained elsewhere, induced a prophetic trance. The gods were also invoked by incense” (Mackenzie, 1915). A view that was shared by even earlier researchers: “The Chaldean Magus [Mesopotamian holy men of the Chaldean kingdom, circa 400-500 BC] used artificial means, intoxicating drugs for instance, in order to attain to [a] state of excitement acts of purification and mysterious rituals increased the power of the incantations. Among these mysterious rituals must be counted the use of enchanted potions which undoubtedly contained drugs that were medically effective” (Lenormant 1874). Considering what these 19th and early 20th century scholars saw as obvious, it is indeed puzzling how the majority of today’s researchers on these topics have been woefully able to ignore these elements of ancient religious practices, despite the mounting evidence now in place. tween Ishtar, Asherah and other goddesses in their origins in Chapter 2, so this is not surprising. The Feminist scholar Buffie Johnson noted that not only is the “Mother Goddess, strongly connected with the Tree of Life, [she] is in a sense the tree itself. At the same time she is outside the tree, vivifying it to bud and flower” ( Johnson 1981). Thus a Babylonian Prayer to the goddess Ishtar proclaimed; Curiously, no surviving texts give a clear indication as to what plant is depicted in the Babylonian and Assyrian Tree of Life images, or their context beyond an association with", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634243995_cleaned.txt:158:bc83a7f549ab", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 2108, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634243995_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634243995", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634243995_cleaned", "chunk_index": 159, "text": "noted that not only is the “Mother Goddess, strongly connected with the Tree of Life, [she] is in a sense the tree itself.

But as we shall see later when we return to a discussion of these images and their relation to the Eden mythology, there is much to indicate a connection both to cannabis and to the archetypical ancient Near Eastern Goddess. We do know certainly through references to qunnabu that cannabis was used in the identical Assyrian sacred rites, which were also depicted in imagery with sacred trees, and eagle headed figures like that described in Ezekiel, and that qunnabu was used in a salve dedicated to Ishtar, and a beer prepared for her that was infused with cannabis, as we have noted earlier. An Eagle headed figure stands beside the ‘tree of life’ that had been taking place there. The prophet is shown the “idol that provokes jealousy,” this has been generally viewed as an Asherah image placed near the altar. As well, Yahweh’s anger burns at seeing “men of the ancients of the house of Israel” worshiping other deities in the confines of the House of the Lord in Jerusalem “with every man his censer in his hand; and a thick cloud of incense went up” (Ezekiel 8:11). “Then he brought me [in a vision] to the entrance of the north gate of Yahweh: and behold, there sat women weeping for Tammuz. Then he said to me, “Have you seen this, O son of man? You will see still greater abominations than these” (Ezekiel 8:14). Ezekiel is then shown twenty-five men, with their backs towards the temple bowing down to the sun in the East, further identifying the Semitic acknowledgment of the sun as a visible symbol of the Lord. Ezekiel then condemns a pagan rite performed in the Temple, where the participants were “putting the branch to their nose” (Ezekiel 8:17). This is another likely reference to the inhaling of the smoke from burning the branches of cannabis. The cult of Tammuz may have been introduced to the Kingdom of Judah during the reign of King Manasseh, who allied himself with the Assyrians after his father, the reformer Hezekiah died. However, some of these elements may have already been long in place. We saw the obvious influence of the love poems of Tammuz and Ishtar on Solomon’s Song of Songs already. As well, as we noted earlier, Dr. Hugh Schonfield suggested that there was a connection between the name of Solomon’s father David, and that", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634243995_cleaned.txt:159:1c650c9bb76a", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 2109, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634243995_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634243995", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634243995_cleaned", "chunk_index": 160, "text": "introduced to the Kingdom of Judah during the reign of King Manasseh, who allied himself with the Assyrians after his father, the reformer Hezekiah died.

As well, as we noted earlier, Dr. Hugh Schonfield suggested that there was a connection between the name of Solomon’s father David, and that of Dad, (also Adad), the counterpart of Tammuz in Palestine. Both were shepherds, and there were indications of fertility worship during David’s reign (2 Samuel 24 18- 25; I Chronicles 21 22-30 and 2 Samuel 21:9). As well, there “was a shrine of Adonis-Tammuz in David’s city of Bethlehem (the place of Bread)” (Schonfield 1966). Adonis is the Semitic name of Tammuz, and it has been also associated with Dionysus, and Adonai, the name that would be used in place of ‘Yahweh’. Adonis is taken from the Phoenician adon, which means “lord.” This very same root word is the basis of the Hebrew word Adonai, which also means “Lord.” It is technically not a proper name, but a title. It became used in place of the proper name for God Yahweh, due to the latter being forbidden to be spoken aloud. Interestingly, as shall be discussed later, these roots may have contributed to a later conflation between Dionysus and Yahweh as well. It is for such idolatry and pagan practices that Ezekiel is told that the Lord’s anger burned against Jerusalem and its fall was imminent. The Babylonian siege of Jerusalem lasts for two years, and over this time all the food runs out. Even the measures taken by Josiah to centralize the kingdom around the royal city of Jerusalem, and stock it against this eventuality, do not prevent the famine. Jeremiah’s Book of Lamentations describes the onset of cannibalism in the intensity of the famine that beset the people: “With their own hands compassionate women have cooked their own children who became their food when my people were destroyed” (Lamentations 4:10). In a grimly humorous account, Yahweh commands his prophet Ezekiel, who begins to be quite active at this point, to do some ritualized performance art in order to demonstrate to his fellow citizens what is about to befall them. Ezekiel is first told to make a clay table with the image of Jerusalem on it, and with toy props “lay siege to it: Erect siege works against it, build a ramp up to it, set up camps against it and put battering-rams around it” (Ezekiel 4:2). After he is finished with his toy battlefield, Ezekiel is further enticed by his daemon Yahweh, to place an iron pan between his face and the city, to show how the inhabitants are going to be cut off from outsiders. But when", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634243995_cleaned.txt:160:072ed08b29b2", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 2110, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634243995_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634243995", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634243995_cleaned", "chunk_index": 161, "text": "with the image of Jerusalem on it, and with toy props “lay siege to it: Erect siege works against it, build a ramp up to it, set up camps against it and put battering-rams around it” (Ezekiel 4:2).

But when Ezekiel is commanded to enact how the people of Jerusalem will be forced to eat unclean food, by preparing and eating a cooked meal, “using human excrement for fuel” (Ezekiel 4:12), the prophet is pushed beyond his limit, and exclaims “Not so, Sovereign Lord!,” forcing Yahweh to compensate by replacing human excrement with more palatable cow dung! In regards to Ezekiel, in rabbinic tradition, he was considered as Jeremiah’s son, as he is described as the son of “Buzi,” a Jewish name that indicates “Despised” and by which Jeremiah was nicknamed for all his doom-saying by his countrymen. Ezekiel’s first vision was said to have occurred about 30 years after the alleged discovery of Deuteronomy in the Temple during the reign of King Josiah. Ancient Jewish sources claim, Ezekiel did not compose the books attributed to him, but instead his prophecies were collected and put into writing by the Men of the Great Assembly, generally identified with Ezra and the group of scribes and lawmakers that accompanied him on his return to the Holy Land after the Exile. Although it is believed Ezekiel was active as a prophet while in Israel, it was while he was in Exile in Babylon that much of the texts that were attributed to him were depicted as taking place. Jeremiah expresses the reason for this disaster overtaking the kingdom in terms of Deuteronomic morality: “The Babylonians who are attacking this city will come in and set it on fire: and they will burn it down, along with the houses where the people provoked me to anger by burning incense on the roofs to Baal, and by pouring out drink offerings to other gods” ( Jeremiah 32:29). This passage also indicates the extent that Josiah’s reform had failed in its attempt to rid the land of all traces of competing worship, all of which returned almost immediately after his unkingly demise. By the reign of Zedekiah the Judahites had fully reverted to the practices of their ancestors.

Jeremiah’s prophecies are vindicated as he had described the coming siege in detail: “I will make them eat the flesh of their sons and daughters, and they will eat one another’s flesh during the stress of the siege imposed on them” ( Jeremiah 19:9). Although, it is important to remember vindication here is based on texts that were composed a considerable amount of time after the events in question, and were likely added to by later Biblical editors. The general view among Hebrew Bible scholars is that Jeremiah was a historical figure, and that much of the texts attributed to him were either written by him and/or his scribe Baruch. Views among historians range from the belief that the narratives and poetic portions of Jeremiah are contemporary with the Prophet’s life, to the view that the work of the original prophet is beyond identification or recovery as so much has been added by later Priestly editors. The Hebrew Bible makes it clear, he was not popular with the people to whom he preached! And with good reason, as he gloated at their demise: “So give their children over to famine; hand them over to the power of the sword. Let their wives be made childless and widows; let their men be put to death, their young men slain by the sword in battle” ( Jeremiah 18:20-21). This vindictive nature of Jeremiah’s preaching called his primary allegiance into question. Jeremiah’s constant haranguing as to the guilt of the Judahites, and gleeful warnings of the coming victory of the Babylonians over the southern kingdom were taken as treasonous by many of the people of Jerusalem and the councilors of the king. Thus Jeremiah is accused of such treachery by the majority of the people and the king’s officials. But, likely with the hopes of an allegiance with the new power, the Babylonians, enough members of the population, and officials stood by Jeremiah, so that “he was not handed over to the people to be put to death” ( Jeremiah 26:24). The final wrath of the Babylonians is unleashed on the Judahites. The Babylonians invade with a full military force and in time they show even less mercy. They overrun Judah and besiege Jerusalem. They strip the temple of all precious metals before burning it to the ground. The royal palaces are likewise burned along with all the important buildings in Jerusalem. The walls surrounding the city are also destroyed, a focused act of demolition which made the city virtually indefensible.

The king, and his family, all the Judahite nobility, the military officers and fighting men, artisans and craftsmen, numbering seventeen thousand in total are all taken captive to Babylon. After Jehoichan’s removal to Babylon, Nebuchadnezzar puts Mattaniah on the throne and he changes his name to Zedekiah (Right of Jah, 597-587 B.C.). Zedekiah soon made the mistake of rebelling against the might of the Babylonians and Jerusalem was again immediately besieged, and in the eyes of the Yahwist prophets, this was due to the kingdom’s continued adulterous worship. The remainder of the population that was left behind after the first Babylonian conquest was carried away to Babylon, leaving behind only the poorest of its residents there. Through the Babylonian conquest, the kingdom of Judah and perhaps more importantly the line of king David, comes to an end. The ruling class are exiled to Babylon, and foreigners are placed in Israel and Judah by the now reigning Babylonians. After the fall of Jerusalem and the beginning of the Exile a very curious occurrence takes place. First the Babylonians release Jeremiah and give him free reign to come or go as he pleases ( Jeremiah 40:4). Then the Babylonian commander says to the newly released Jeremiah: “Go back to Gedaliah son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan, whom the king of Babylon has appointed over the towns of Judah, and live with him among the people, or go anywhere else you please” ( Jeremiah 40:5). Here at this pivotal point in the history of the Kingdom, it is the Deuteronomic cabal that is given power, giving more weight to the accusation that Jeremiah was a traitor and conspirator with the Babylonians. Obviously the denunciations of Jeremiah for treachery against the state were more than just slanderous attempts at discrediting him. Once again Jeremiah and the families of the priest and scribe that penned the Book of Deuteronomy are in alliance, this time openly supported by the Babylonians. King Nebuchadnezzar was familiar with the preaching of Jeremiah which was aligned so seamlessly to the Babylonian foreign policy. Jeremiah and the royal and priestly officials who supported each other are all amply rewarded for their part in the campaign against their own people, the Judahites. For Jeremiah’s recognized service to the Babylonians in advising the successive kings of Judah to bow down to them and admit defeat, the Babylonians released him from prison where King Zedekiah had him placed for his seeming treachery, leaving him free to go wherever he chose.

After the fall of Jerusalem a remnant of the people had gone to Egypt to resettle, so Jeremiah decided to follow behind to act as a prophet of Yahweh for these Israelite immigrants, whether they liked it or not! Jeremiah begins his ministry in Egypt by blaming the displaced Judahites and their ancestors for the fall of Jerusalem, and then continues with further condemnations against them for continuing on with the adulterous practices of their ancestors, it is made clear, that the burning of incense to the Queen of Heaven, was a core aspect of these adulterous practices: This is what the LORD Almighty, the God of Israel says: “You saw the great disaster I brought on Jerusalem and on all the towns of Judah. Today they lie deserted and in ruins because of the evil they have done. They provoked me to anger by burning incense and by worshiping other gods.… Again and again I sent my servants the prophets, who said, “Do not do the detestable things I hate!” But they did not listen or pay attention; they did not turn from their wickedness or stop burning incense to other gods. Therefore my fierce anger was poured out; it raged against the towns of Judah and the streets of Jerusalem and made them the desolate ruins they are today.” “…Why provoke me to anger [again] … burning incense to other gods in Egypt, where you have come to live? You will destroy yourselves and make yourselves an object of cursing and reproach among all the nations of the earth. Have you forgotten the wickedness committed by your fathers and by the kings and queens of Judah and the wickedness committed by you and your wives in the land of Judah and the streets of Jerusalem? Up to this day they have not humbled themselves or shown reverence, nor have they followed my law and decrees I set before you and your fathers.” Therefore, this is what the Lord Almighty, the God of Israel says: “I am determined to bring disaster on you and destroy all Judah. I will take away the remnant of Judah who were determined to go to Egypt to settle there. They will all perish in Egypt.… I will punish those who live in Egypt with sword famine and plague, as I punished Jerusalem.

None of the remnant of Judah who have gone to live in Egypt will escape or survive to return to the land of Judah…” Then all the men which knew that their wives had burned incense unto other gods, and all the women that stood by, a great multitude, even all the people that dwelt in the land of Egypt, in Pathros, answered Jeremiah, saying, “As for the word that thou hast spoken unto us in the name of the Lord, we will not hearken unto thee. But we will certainly do whatsoever thing goeth forth out of our own mouth, to burn incense unto the queen of heaven, and to pour drink offerings unto her, as we have done, we, and our fathers, our kings, and our princes, in the city of Judah, and in the streets of Jerusalem: for then we had plenty of victuals, and were well, and saw no evil. But since we left off to burn incense to the queen of heaven, and poured out drink offerings to her, we have wanted all things, and have been consumed by sword and by famine.” Then Jeremiah said unto all the people, to the men, and to the women, and to all the people which had given him that answer saying, The incense that ye burned in the cities of Judah, and in the streets of Jerusalem, ye, and your fathers, your kings, and your princes, and the people of the land, did not the Lord remember them, and came it not into his mind? So that the Lord could no longer bear, because of the evil of your doings, and because of the abominations which ye have committed; therefore is your land a desolation, and astonishment, and a curse, without an inhabitant, as at this day. Because ye have burned incense and because ye have sinned against the Lord, and have not obeyed the voice of the Lord, not walked in his law, nor in his statutes, not in his testimonies; therefore this evil has happened to you, as at this day ( Jeremiah 44:1-23). From the description given in the words of the angry prophet himself, we can see that Jeremiah was viewed with disdain by the populace. They likely saw him as a traitor for siding with the Babylonians, who themselves liked the prophet enough not to kill him, even rewarding with release from prison and right of free access.

The “reforms” Jeremiah represented as a member of the cabal which formed around the forged Book of Deuteronomy, were clearly unpopular and had to be forced upon the people by threat of death for non-compliance. As we have seen, even with such Draconian edicts, these counterfeit decrees failed to last a lifetime after Josiah’s initial actions to institute them. In this telling passage, we learn so much about the Biblical roots of prohibition. Jeremiah’s reference to the previous kings and princes, who burned incense to the Queen of Heaven can be seen as referring to King Solomon, his son, Rehoboam, and most of the other Biblical Kings and apparently, from the Bible’s own records, most of the populace. The evidence at tel Arad make it clear as to what form of incense was used, as does the sweet smelling kaneh reference in Jeremiah. It is also likely that the pouring out of drink offerings referred to a cannabis infusion, as we know such preparations were poured out to Ishtar. As noted in Chapter 2, The Sourcebook for Ancient Mesopotamian Medicine (2014) recorded a recipe that requires three shekels of qunnabu [cannabis] to be mixed with other aromatic plants in a beer libation dedicated to be poured out to Ishtar, under the title Beltu, meaning “Lady.” This ritual act could easily have been followed by the cults of other related Goddesses. Interestingly, in the words of Jeremiah we find absolutely no reference to the holy anointing oils and incenses, as he himself apparently did not use them. This was due to its content of kaneh, which he himself, speaking for the Lord, condemns by name. “What do I care about frankincense from Sheba or sweet smelling cane [kaneh] from a distant land? Your burnt offerings are not acceptable; your sacrifices do not please me” ( Jeremiah 6:20). Clearly, up until this time, cannabis had been an integral and popular part of mainstream Judaic worship, as practiced by the people of the land. Jeremiah’s prohibitions against it in the name of the Lord were seen by the populace as the empty words of a pseudo-prophet and the lies and decrees of a traitor to his people. We see the beginnings of what led to Jeremiah’s complete cannabis prohibition in the words of Yahweh, through earlier prophets like Isaiah, who condemn not cannabis itself, but its use in pagan worship instead of being dedicated to him: “You have not brought", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634243995_cleaned.txt:166:f6f5f2e19ab2", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 2116, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634243995_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634243995", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634243995_cleaned", "chunk_index": 167, "text": "people of the land.

Here it is the lack of cannabis offerings that is condemned through the prophet. According to Isaiah, Yahweh is angry because kaneh was used in the worship of other gods, and the anger of the prophets who spoke in his name, can be seen as jealousy over watching their beloved cannabis going to other temples instead of their own. Sentiments that are echoed in the book of Ezekiel, where Yahweh, speaking in the first person, condemns the Israelites who “offered my oil and incense before” other gods in orgiastic rites. Such anger over dissuaded sacrifices of tithes and other offerings resulted in the “discovery,” or rather creation, of Deuteronomy. By the time of Jeremiah, the use of cannabis had become associated so fully with “idolatrous worship” that it had fallen completely out of use amongst the Hebrew Priestly caste. The words of the Lord through Jeremiah, are the words of the dour old prophet himself; and his condemnations against cannabis incense, the prohibitions of a corrupt regime that would likely have completely lost its hold over the people, without the Babylonian’s conquest of Jerusalem. Clearly, the goddess had been worshiped throughout the history of the Hebrews, along with Yahweh. The refusal by the Jews of Egypt to give up the worship of the Queen of Heaven, was not in any way a rejection of Yahweh, who they continued to worship alongside her. Because of her historical association with Yahweh in inscriptions, and frequent mention of her iconography in the Hebrew Bible, many scholars see the ‘Queen of Heaven’ as a direct reference to Asherah. Jeremiah’s specific condemnations against both Frankincense and Kaneh, help to secure the identification of cannabis as kaneh per Sula Benet’s etymological theory, as these are the very items recovered off the two altars at the canceled temple in tel Arad, which has its own association with the combined worship of Yahweh and Asherah. The people who Jeremiah are rallying against as well, make it very clear, these were long standing practices that had been in place for generations prior.

Ishtar, who is often equated with Astarte, has been suggested due to her association with Tammuz, who according to Ezekiel, was worshiped within the Jewish temple prior to the fall of Jerusalem. As well, historically we know from ancient inscriptions that read “Anat-Yahu,” that “in the fifth century B.C. a Jewish colony in Elephantine, Egypt, did apparently believe that Yahweh had a partner Anath” (Anderson 1975). Anath is generally paired with Yahweh’s constant rival Baal, however Asherah was paired with Canaanite El, before Ugaritic inscriptions depicted her as the wife of Yahweh. As we have seen, Yahweh assimilated aspects of both Baal and El. The syncretism of Yahweh’s cult has been the key to its lasting success. That Yahweh may at this time have been paired with Anat, in some regions and time periods, is clearly possible, and in Elephantine it certainly was the case. Also important to remember in this regard, is that some scholars hold the view that these three goddesses, Anat, Asherah and Ishtar/Astarte represented a single triple goddess. The Elephantine papyri are interesting, as they depict Jewish polytheism still clearly in play in the 5th century BCE. As well, they contain correspondence with the religious authorities in Jerusalem, who seemed to hold no issue with this polytheism. In discussions of how to perform Passover, no mention of Moses or the existing mythology of the holiday are in place in the correspondence. As Mircea Eliade noted: “Without religious elites, and more especially without the prophets, Judaism would not have become anything very different from the religion of the Jewish colony in Elephantine, which preserved the popular Palestinian religious viewpoint down to the fifth century B.C. … History had allowed these Hebrews of the Diaspora to retain, side by side with Yahweh … other divinities … and even the goddess Anath.… This is one more confirmation of the importance of history in the development of Judaic religious experience and its maintenance under high tensions” (Eliade 1954). The Egyptian remnant of Judahites, did not in fact deny Yahweh but acknowledged him alongside the goddess. What was rejected was Jeremiah’s own political religious view of state-monotheism, a new theological viewpoint that had risen after the alleged “discovery” of the Book of the Law, Deuteronomy, which was established through the fall of Jerusalem. The Yahwists’ rigid insistence upon not only Yahweh’s supremacy, but also Yahweh as the only god was a very late development.

As Tikva Simone Frymer-Kensky, who was a Professor at the University of Chicago Divinity School, has noted “Ancient customs and symbols, long part of Israel’s heritage, eventually did not fit the increasingly radical monotheistic sensibility. They were condemned as ‘foreign’ and ultimately eradicated. The bronze serpent is one such symbol, the asherah is another” (Frymer-Kensky 1992). Cannabis still another…. That Rehoboam should plant an Asherah pole which remained standing until the reform of Hezekiah in the eighth century testifies to the centrality of the worship of Asherah in Hebrew culture. Likewise that Jehu’s reforms removed all traces of Baal worship but didn’t disturb the rites of Asherah, not even to mention them, further testifies to the irreproachability of the cult of Asherah. Again even the purges of Elijah the great, involved only the massacre of the priests of Baal. There is no mention of the deaths of the worshipers or ministers of Asherah in the slaughter. Thus, the “complex of altar, tree, hill, and megalith that characterized this worship was an ancient and integral part of Israel’s religious life, and the ‘reforms’ of Hezekiah and Josiah that destroyed this complex were a radical innovation rather than a return to some pristine purity” (Frymer-Kensky 1992). Further, if we were to look at the Hebrew Bible’s historical record itself, we would find that the people were correct in their statements concerning the prosperity of the kingdom coinciding with the supposedly pagan worship that Jeremiah so harshly condemned. High points in the kingdom occurred under idolatrous kings such as Solomon, Ahab, Manasseh, and Jereboam II. The only two kings after David who appear in the Lord’s favor, Hezekiah and Josiah, both had unpopular reigns, and their actions throughout can be seen as contributing greatly to the kingdom’s eventual demise. Hezekiah was forced to bow down to the Babylonians and the Assyrians, and Josiah particularly comes to an ignominious end by receiving the arrow of an Egyptian Pharaoh. However, through their reforms, along with the influence of Jeremiah, and the prophets of Yahweh that rallied against the “adulterous” fertility worship practiced throughout the land, they were eventually suppressed. The fertility worship, the religion of the people of the land, was seen as “prostitution” by the Yahwist dictators, but in actuality “represents one of the most widespread forms of cosmic religiosity. Specifically characteristic of agriculturists, cosmic religiosity continued the most elementary dialectic of the sacred … the belief that the divine is incarnated, or manifests itself, in cosmic objects and rhythms”", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634243995_cleaned.txt:169:25ac237348b0", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 2119, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634243995_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634243995", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634243995_cleaned", "chunk_index": 170, "text": "prophets of Yahweh that rallied against the “adulterous” fertility worship practiced throughout the land, they were eventually suppressed.

Specifically characteristic of agriculturists, cosmic religiosity continued the most elementary dialectic of the sacred … the belief that the divine is incarnated, or manifests itself, in cosmic objects and rhythms” (Eliade 1978). The prophets finally succeeded in emptying nature of any divine presence. Whole sectors of the natural world–the ‘high places’, stones, springs, trees, certain crops, certain flowers– will be denounced as unclean because they were polluted by the cult of the Canaanite divinities of fertility. The preeminently clean and holy region is the desert alone, for it is there that Israel remained faithful to its God (Eliade 1978). The prophets also marked the disappearance of the qedeshim, the hierodule “cult-prostitutes,” who as we have discussed, at times occupied the Temple of Jerusalem itself. “They seem to have been eliminated finally only after the Fall of the Temple and the Babylonian exile. Cultic sexual activity became synonymous with abandoning the worship of the true god and turning to the worship of false gods.… The terms used to identify the cult priestesses became insults used as invectives against the Goddess worshipers” (Gadon 1989). The disappearance of cultic sexual activity was of primary importance to the establishment of the ancient Hebrew faith. As long as the temple priestesses were the bearers of the mysterious, life-enhancing powers of creativity and procreativity, these powers could not be claimed by the creator-god. The Hebrew god took unto himself the sacred life-giving powers of the Goddess (Gadon 1989). Babylon’s conquest of Jerusalem, particularly the destruction of the temple, was in many ways a reset button for the religion. the people, especially those who were subjected to captivity. Besides producing some of the more memorable poetry of the Psalms, the time spent in the great Chaldean capital of Babylon contributed enormously to the Israelites continually evolving theology, and colored the books of prophets like Ezekiel and Daniel, as well as others. It was through the Exile that the Hebrews were exposed to the culture of the greatest city up to that point in history, and after such exposure things would never be the same for them again. The Israelites were a displaced people in the city of Babylon and as such didn’t possess land to farm, so they became merchants. The trade that passed through Babylon as the center of the Chaldean empire provided an opportunity for gathering wealth, and it is here that the Jewish people gained a strong and lasting association as merchants.

Thus it was for the prosperity they experienced that many of the exiles chose to remain in the great Babylonian cities, even after their later liberation. The priestly theocracy, the increased urbanization of the Israelites, the Jewish apocalyptic literature, and the pointed formation of messianic expectation all resulted from this period of the exile. With the ending of political power, and the line of Hebrew kings, the role of the priesthood became increasingly important. No longer having a nation to call their own, the Israelites turned to their priesthood for their sense of national identity. “It was in this period that traditional Judaism appeared, the new Law was elaborated and imposed in all its force, and the priestly projection of Hebrew origins became rampant” (La Barre 1970). Clearly, the leading focus in this final group of Biblical re-writers and compilers known as the Priestly editors, were the views held by Jeremiah. Having seen first hand how his father and other figures re-invented Judaic history through the Book of the Law, Jeremiah took this further, and established the priestly theocracy as the new foundation of the faith. As the editors of the Dartmouth Bible stated, the aim of these Priestly editors was “to translate into reality the blueprint for a theocratic state.” As Bishop John Shelby Spong explained of these revisions: Synagogues were built under the leadership of the priestly group in the exile to indoctrinate the coming generation, who would not remember Jerusalem, including in time those who had never known Jerusalem. The details of worship, the rules of worship, the observance of worship became all important and resulted in the creation of much of the Book of Exodus, almost all the Book of Leviticus, and major portions of the Book of Numbers. The Yahwist-Elohist-Deuteronomic version of the Hebrew sacred story was thoroughly edited by the priestly writers to include the ancient priestly traditions and to affirm the sanctity throughout all of Jewish history of the traditions now being required of faithful Jews (Spong 1991). It was the fifth century BCE priestly writers who gave us the definition of “Kosher” foods. “A history of every ritual observed in Jewish worship entered the sacred story” (Spong 1991), i.e., former agricultural festivals such as Passover were incorporated into a mythic past about the Exodus, in much the same way Christmas replaced earlier solstice celebrations of paganism. “The Priestly Code also invented exorbitant tithes and inserted them into older documents, now including cattle and sheep in addition to the proper measure of corn and oil", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634243995_cleaned.txt:171:ec9587f88100", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 2121, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634243995_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634243995", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634243995_cleaned", "chunk_index": 172, "text": "writers who gave us the definition of “Kosher” foods. “A history of every ritual observed in Jewish worship entered the sacred story” (Spong 1991), i.e., former agricultural festivals such as Passover were incorporated into a mythic past about the Exodus, in much the same way Christmas replaced earlier solstice celebrations of paganism. “The Priestly Code also invented exorbitant tithes and inserted them into older documents, now including cattle and sheep in addition to the proper measure of corn and oil and wine – almost a blasphemy in terms of the older religion” (La Barre 1970). All the chronologies in the Hebrew Bible were in fact composed by the Priestly writers, who wanted to have a seeming historical basis for their religious authority. But in the re-recording of historical fact, the saga was appended with new fictional material to justify Yahweh’s workings through history, as well as the addition of non-existent persons, and supposedly ancient prophecies that predicted what were by then historic events. Indeed, the Priestly editors rewrote the history of a scattered and dismayed people in a bid for both power and control that was more successful than they ever could have imagined. Moreover, the effects of this theological and political coup can still be felt in the modern day. With the fall of the kings and rise of the new priestly class, which took place in the Babylonian exile, it is interesting to note that it is at this juncture in history that the Levites begin garnering a pronounced decline in Yahweh’s favor. The Hebrew Bible makes it clear this was due to allowing the pagan practices of the pre-exilic period. The Lord warned the Levites through the prophet Malachi (Messenger), telling them “Because of you I will cut off your seed, and spread on your faces the dung from your festival sacrifices … you have turned from the way and by your teaching have caused many to stumble; you have violated the covenant with Levi.… So I have caused you to be despised and humiliated before all the people” (Malachi 2:3-9). Ezekiel’s writings also refer to Yahweh’s condemnation of the “Levites who went far from me when Israel went astray and who wandered from me after their idols must bear the consequence of their sin … because they served them in the presence of their idols and made the house of Israel fall into sin, therefore I have sworn with uplifted hand that they must bear the consequence of their sin” (Ezekiel 44:10-12). These were the same Levites, who for centuries had been burning the incense to the brazen serpent that was said to have been made by their sect’s founder Moses, and who acted as shaman initiators, the seraphim, or fiery serpents in the temple in the story of Isaiah. These were the same Levite, sons of snakes who tended the temple throughout the whole monarchic", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634243995_cleaned.txt:172:63d606fc0152", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 2122, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634243995_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634243995", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634243995_cleaned", "chunk_index": 173, "text": "have sworn with uplifted hand that they must bear the consequence of their sin” (Ezekiel 44:10-12).

These were the same Levite, sons of snakes who tended the temple throughout the whole monarchic period, at times, alongside both male and female cult prostitutes. Nowhere can this sudden disfavor of the Levites be more clearly seen than in the rise of the priestly caste, through the edicts of Deuteronomy. It was a new religious renovation, or even a religio-political coup. Those Levites who remained were limited to the role of the priests’ servants: “They are not to come near to serve me as priests or come near any of my holy things or my holy offerings; they must bear the shame of their detestable practices. Yet I will put them in charge of the duties of the temple and all the work that is to be done in it” (Ezekiel 44:13-14). The Book of Leviticus also did not reach its present form till the Persian Period, from 538-332 BCE. The entire composition of the book of Leviticus is Priestly literature. Considering what we have seen in regards to kaneh from the Priestly caste, Leviticus 10:1-2 is very interesting: “Aaron’s sons Nadab and Abihu took their censers, put fire in them and added incense; and they offered strange fire before Yahweh, contrary to his command. So fire came out from the presence of the Yahweh and consumed them, and they died before the Yahweh.” It seems that it was here, with the Priestly writers and particularly Jeremiah, that an intentional suppression of the earlier ritual use of cannabis was iinflicted. The Slave-Prophet; The Book of Daniel The Book of Daniel (Judge of God) is written in the tradition of Babylonian Exile, depicting historic figures such as Nebuchadnezzar and other foreign kings. But, in scholarly circles, the Book of Daniel is believed to be of a much later composition than that of the stories which it depicts, and is actually considered by some to be the last book added to the Hebrew Bible. It is usually read as a miraculous foretelling of future events, records of Daniel’s prophetic visions of invasions and conquerors. In actuality the Book of Daniel as it reads in the Hebrew Bible has been dated at 165 B.C. and these ‘prophecies’ were written in hindsight. The “Daniel” the book is supposedly authored by was a traditional and pious Israelite referred to in the writings of Ezekiel, alongside other legendary figures such as Noah and Job.

However, this is believed to be in reference to Dan’el, who was a heroic figure from the Canaanite Ras Shamra texts. That Ezekiel wrote of Dan’el in favorable terms reveals his resonance with these facets of Northern kingdom culture. “The reference to Dan’el as he was spelt in the Ras Shamra legend of Aqht, indicates Ezekiel’s familiarity with the literary tradition of Canaan” (Gray 1969). The author of the Book of Daniel chose this name to write under to give his writings the respect and authority associated with this name. “In the late post-exilic period, when prophecy was believed to have ceased, it was common to release writings under the name of some figure of ancient Jewish tradition” (Anderson 1975). Curiously Josephus tells us that Daniel was a eunuch which as we know from the laws of Moses would have precluded him from worship in the temple (Josephus; Antiquities 10:10:2). The Hebrew Bible portrays Daniel as an ascetic vegetarian, who along with three of his countrymen were trained in the language and culture of the Babylonians, and worked in the service of king Nebuchadnezzar, his successor, and then later the Persian kings, who overcame the Babylonians. After, showing evidence of wisdom and understanding that was “ten times better than all the magicians and enchanters in his whole kingdom,” Daniel was appointed by the ancient Babylonian king Nebuchadnezzar as his head dream interpreter and astrologer, a job Daniel was paid for with offerings of incense. That Daniel accepted offerings of incense shows his unfamiliarity with the reforms of Jeremiah, (if Daniel existed at all, he would have been in exile through the peak of Jeremiah’s career). The famous account of Nebuchadnezzar eating “grass as doth an oxen” for seven years, in order to humble himself, was foretold in a dream interpreted by Daniel, who tells the king that his descent and sojourn into the wilderness, will last “until you acknowledge that the Most High is sovereign over the kingdoms of men and gives them to anyone he wishes” (Daniel 4:25). Interestingly, here we see the tradition that began with the fall of Samaria (in which the Assyrians were working on behalf of the Lord), that all victors and rulers, despite their religious creed, were placed as such by Yahweh’s divine will and edict. A curious way of interpreting their own continued defeat and subjugation, as further evidence of their own God’s interaction with history.

A curious way of interpreting their own continued defeat and subjugation, as further evidence of their own God’s interaction with history. (With this line of religious thought, the southern prophet Isaiah would refer to the Persian king Cyrus as “the anointed of Yahweh”). Dr. Creighton, who saw references to cannabis in the Biblical term “honey-wood,” also felt the tale of Nebuchadnezzar eating grass, gave indication of cannabis use. He stated that “in the case of Daniel’s apologue of Nebuchadnezzar’s fall, it arises from the eating of ‘grass’, the Semitic word having both a generic and a colloquial meaning (hachish), as well as from the introduction of the subjective perceptions of hachish intoxication as gigantic or grotesque objects” (Creighton 1903). In relation to Nebuchadnezzar eating grass, as noted earlier in the P’sachim, “Rav Yehudah says it is good to eat … the essence of hemp seed in Babylonian broth; but it is not lawful to mention this in the presence of an illiterate man, because he might derive a benefit from the knowledge not meant for him. Nedarim, fol. 49, col. 1^(𝔫) (Harris, et al., 2004). In many ancient references that mention cannabis “seed” it is likely meant “seeded bud” or seeds with the THC calyx enveloping them still intact. This passage is interesting in its reference to both the “benefit” from the broth and its origin in “Babylon.” Nebuchadnezzar eats grass, “as doth an oxen” for seven years, which brings back to mind the ox of creation, depicted with Esarhaddon. He tells us at the end of his seven year sojourn; “I raised my eyes towards heaven, and my sanity was restored. Then I praised the Most High: I honored and glorified him who lives for ever.… I was restored to my throne and became even greater than before. Now I, Nebuchadnezzar, praise and exalt and glorify the King of heaven”(Daniel 5:34- 37). Here the author of Daniel would have us believe that the famous Babylonian king had accepted the divine rule of Yahweh, the god of a people he easily conquered. A fact that the historical records blatantly contradict, and again gives us ample evidence of the vast theological transition within Hebrew thought, in that Yahweh, the God of a limited and tribal “chosen people,” through their defeat, had become the cosmic, Most High, ruler of all humanity and the universe in general. Upon the fall of the Babylonians to Persian forces, the later Persian kings who now ruled the ancient city, Cyrus and Darius, are said to have retained Daniel in the position of dream interpreter and councilor.

Both Darius and Cyrus are known historically to have been followers of the teachings of the Persian shaman Zoroaster and his monotheistic-like god Ahura Mazda – a deity who shares many traits with Yahweh. Like other ancient cultures, as we shall see, the Zoroastrians utilized cannabis in rituals. That Daniel mentions King Darius is particularly interesting, as Darius, both in tradition and in the view of some scholars, is said to have been the son of King Vishtaspa, In some ancient inscriptions and sources, Hystaspes, a Greek name, is viewed as identical with Vishtaspa (the Avestan name for Hystapes), an early patron of Zoroaster. Also interesting is that Vishtaspa was said to have taken on the faith of Zoroastrianism, after an intense initiation with bhanga, becoming Zoroaster’s first convert. A situation we will look at more closely in the next chapter with a look at the Persian Empire, the Zoroastrian influence on the ancient Hebrews, and their return to their homeland… Although the references to kaneh and kaneh bosm, came to an end in the Hebrew Bible, this does not seem to be the case for forward here, the evidence indicates infused wines as the mode of consumption. The evidence for the use of such mixtures is very intriguing. This is particularly true in regards to the story of Ezra, who by tradition is said to have collected and placed the various books that make up the Hebrew Bible in their current order. The Persian Empire rose to power and replaced the Babylonians. At the height of their glory they stretched from the Greek Ionian Islands to the Punjab and the Indus valley in India. The Persians differed from the Egyptian, Assyrian and Babylonian Empires that had preceded them in a number of ways, particularly in regard to being more liberally minded and compassionate than the previous Empires. As well, when they expanded the Persians instilled a system of viable roads, and then policed them. This fostered an increased trade across the huge continental expanse of the Persian empire – trade which was encouraged and thrived. Part of this cultural exchange was also cosmological. The Persians practiced the religion of Zoroaster. This religion was a departure from the practices of Sumer that had so influenced the entire Fertile Crescent. Zoroastrianism is often suggested as the world’s oldest monotheistic religion, or at least one of the earliest, however it contains both monotheistic and dualistic elements.

Zoroastrianism is often suggested as the world’s oldest monotheistic religion, or at least one of the earliest, however it contains both monotheistic and dualistic elements. Good and Evil were strictly delineated from each other. Ahuramazda being the supreme god of the Zoroastrians and Angra Mainyu, his evil arch rival. The later Christian views of Satan and Hell are based more on Zoroastrian views than Jewish. Zoroastrianism is responsible for the introduction of many other ideas that were to have a profoundly formative effect upon both Judaism and later Christianity. The testimony of the Bible also sheds light on the more benevolent policies of the Persians. The Israelite captives who had been taken from the pillaged Jerusalem by the victorious Babylonians were all returned to their homelands by Cyrus, who was praised lavishly in the writings of Second Isaiah for his benevolent acts of restoration: This is what the Lord says to his anointed, to Cyrus, whose right hand I take hold of to subdue nations before him and to strip the kings of their armor, and to open doors before him so that gates will not be shut: I will go before you and level mountains; I will break down gates of bronze and cut through bars of iron. I will give you treasures of darkness, riches stored in secret places, so that you may know that I am the Lord, God of Israel, who summons you by name. For the sake of Jacob my servant, of Israel my chosen, I summon you by name and bestow on you a title of honor, though you do not acknowledge me. I am the Lord, and there is no other; apart from me there is no God. I will strengthen you, though you have not acknowledged me.… I will raise up Cyrus in my righteousness (Isaiah 45:1-13). Upon returning the Israelite exiles to their former homeland, Cyrus appointed a Hebrew governor over them, his former cupbearer Nehemiah. Cyrus also permitted the reconstruction of the temple and the re-establishment of the sacrifices to Yahweh. The Bible’s book of Ezra even presents letters of Cyrus testifying to his support of this venture. Thus the exile of the Israelites lasted for only half a century. The Babylonians had conquered Jerusalem and destroyed the temple in 586 B.C. and the exiles were returned by Cyrus in 538 B.C. But the Israelites were changed forever.

This makes Cyrus the messiah, the “anointed one,” a title formerly given to the Hebrew priests and kings who had been anointed with the cannabis holy oil. The ritual use of cannabis in ancient Persia is well attested. Here again, as with earlier cultures the Hebrews came into contact with, perhaps the use of the identical sacrament acted as some sort of a catalyst for a symbiosis between the two religions? Zoroaster was a religious reformer who took the multi-pantheon Ancient Iranian religion, and raised one deity from that to be the sole deity, Ahura Mazda. However, since considerable power was handed over to his arch enemy Angra Mainyu, a figure that is comparable to the later Christian concepts of Satan, some see Zoroastrianism as Dualistic rather than Monotheistic. The religion most comparable to the pre-Zoroastrian situation, would be Hinduism in India. Indeed, due to similar myths, god names, and the use of a sacred beverage, made from a plant-based sacrament known as Haoma in Persia and Soma in India, as well as in the language of the Persian Avesta and the Vedic Indian Rig Veda, a general view is that these two regions emerged from the same earlier source. All though there are many suggestions as to what plant was originally used for this ancient entheogenic sacrament, my view, which is laid out in more detail in Cannabis and the Soma Solution (2010) than there is room for here, is that the origins and identity of Haoma, and thus Soma, can be made on a combination of archaeological and linguistic evidence in a similar way to what we have seen with cannabis and kaneh bosm, and likewise it was cannabis based. Both the ritual use of cannabis and haoma/soma can be traced back to Indo-European cultures. The ritual consumption of Haoma and Soma still continues to this day, but it has generally been acknowledged that the modern counterpart of these sacred beverages differs from the ancient in content, and at one time the preparation held a powerful psychoactive effect. Whereas today, it’s more of a mild stimulant, an effect produced by the currently used Ephedra, which was likely a part of the ancient drink as well. This ancient sacred drink was likely to resemble a drink what today is called bhang, made from the crushed leaves of Indian Hemp. Every Shaivite has to consume bhang at least once a year.

The drink, which intensifies perceptivity, induces visions and above all leads to extreme mental concentration. It is widely used by Yogis. Details concerning its preparation are to be found as early as the Vedic period. The description of the way soma was prepared and its immediate use without fermentation, can only apply to bhang and is identical to the method employed today (Danielou 1992). Likewise, the noted historian and Indologist Professor. A.L. Basham, recorded in his The Wonder That Was India: A Survey of the Culture of the Indian Sub-Continent before the coming of the Muslims: “The drink prepared from the plant … was made with great ceremony in the course of the sacrifice, when the herb was pressed between stones, mixed with milk, strained, and drunk on the same day…. The effects of soma … are rather like those attributed to such drugs as hashish. Soma may well have been hemp, which grows wild in parts of India, Central Asia and South Russia, and from which modern Indians produce a narcotic drink called ‘bhang’” (Basham 1961). We also find this identification with a number of Indian scholars as well. Braja Lal Mukherjee was the first amongst a number of Vedic researchers who suggested bhang (hemp) as a candidate for Soma in his 1921 essay, “The Soma Plant.” Other Indian researchers who have made this distinction include Joges Candra Ray (1939); Chandra Chakraberty, (1944); Vikramasiṃha, (1967); Indian botanist B.G.L. Swamy (1976); Ramachandran and Mativāṇan̲, (1991); Dr. N.R. Waradpande (1995); and Indra Deva & Shrirama, (1999). The Russian archaeologist Victor Sarianidi (1929-2013) claimed to have found archaeological evidence in the Afghanistan desert, related to the production of this sacred beverage, stating it was generally composed of cannabis and ephedra, but in some cases opium poppy was also used. Although there is controversy around Sarianidi’s archaeological claims, I think the Russian Archaeologist was correct in his designation of soma as a preparation of cannabis and ephedra and his claims are slowly becoming mainstream enough to be cited in texts like The Persian Empire: A Historical Encyclopedia in its description for “Haoma”: “The ingredients of the sacred Haoma juice were most probably ephedra mixed with poppy and cannabis” (Kia, 2016). Sarianidi based his claims on archaeological discoveries from the Bactria Margiana Archaeological Complex (BMAC) in Afghanistan, a region thought to be the birthplace of the Zoroastrian religion.

Sarianidi found three large temple sites, and suggested that a large portion of the temple grounds were dedicated to the preparation of a sacred beverage that contained cannabis and ephedra, and in later cases opium was also found. Sarianidi claimed evidence of residues of these plants in gypsum sediments of ancient pots, as well as impressions of seeds he identified as cannabis seeds. Unfortunately, working on a low budget, the items that were tested were left exposed in the sun after the Russian scientists’ analysis, Western scientists were unable to reproduce them, and this has resulted in a dispute over the Russian results, where they are generally still accepted in Russia, but dismissed by Western Scientists. The debate continues…. However, despite the controversy that plagues Sarianidi’s team’s claims, other archaeological and linguistic evidence that corroborates Sarianidi’s research have since emerged. In Chapter 3 we discussed the Indo-European evidence for cannabis, which included braziers, used for burning it in rituals discovered with IE groups who had settled in China. Not only evidence of burnt cannabis in braziers were found, but also processed female cannabis flowers were also recovered in tombs, as well as ephedra. Evidence from artifacts recovered from both these Chinese sites and BMAC in Afghanistan indicate there were trade routes between these locations. As we have noted the etymological origins of cannabis in IE languages, an explanation is needed for the origins of the term haoma, and it seems it is likely with the groups in China that the term first originated. It would seem that it was here, at this meeting place of cultures in China, that the Haoma/Soma cult may have first originated under the name hu-ma, or other Chinese variations, which have been translated as “Scythian cannabis,” or “fire cannabis.” Cannabis has its own Indo-European name kanna, and this is derived from the proto-Indo-European language, Finno-Ugric, kannap. However, the name Haoma may have been developed from the Chinese term. As has long been noted, there are Chinese words indicating an Indo-European origin, thus it would not be surprising if the “linguistic may … have been two-way … European words for silk … are related to the oldest reconstructable Chinese words for silk, *_(se(g)^(′′)) (Barber, 1999) thus the same situation could take us from hu ma to haoma.

This may be another important piece of evidence when trying to understand the identity of the ancient soma/ haoma plant, as ephedra is used to this day as haoma and soma, in rites in both Persia and India, and were part of Sarianidi’s finding in BMAC. Like the Haoma beverage which contained both Ephedra and cannabis, allied forms of the Chinese term “huang-ma” and other variations such as “hu-ma,” “ho-ma” can and have been applied to both plants.

Mahdihassan, who has given this etymology a lot of thought and study, has noted in ‘The Seven Theories Identifying the Soma Plant’: …This much may be said that the name soma is really Sau– Ma, and its original is Chinese as Hau-Ma, which means fireed-Hemp. The plant which was first discovered in china had yellow stalks which resembled the fibers of hemp in shape and in color. It may be boted [sic] that the hemp fibers are yellowish or orange colored and there was no word for orange hence it was compared to the color of fire. Thus soma or better sau-Ma would suggest a herb like hemp-fibers. It has therefore been mistaken for the hemp plant itself, which is also the Bhang plant (Mahdihassan, 1989). One thing that comes to mind in this is that S. Mahdihassan assumes fire-hemp, identifies the color of the plant, and on that makes a connection to the color of ephedra’s flowers. However we now know the Indo-European groups in China were burning cannabis, as were the Scythians and this could well identify that, and this has been the view of other researchers on the meaning of the term hu-ma. We also know in this same time period Taoist adepts were burning cannabis in incense censers and traveling to the “Land of the Immortals” likely influenced by the use they were witnessing among the Indo-European settlers, who used it in funerary rituals. Moreover the name Hua-ma favors this interpretation as in modern Chinese, Ephedra is actually a reversal of this term, Ma Huang (a situation that may address the ying yang like relationship between the two plants’ varying effects!). Mahdihassan tries to address this situation in another article with its long explanatory title “Ephedra as Soma Meaning Hemp Fibers With Soma Later Misidentified As The Hemp Plant Itself” (1989).

The two medicinal plants, Cannabis and Ephedra, are given very allied names in Chinese; Cannabis = Huang-Ma and Ephedra μ = Ma Huang. These names are mirror images of each other and as such next to being identical. The similarity of these names assumes that Ephedra, Ma-Huang, was discovered later than Hemp, Huang-Ma, and that Ephedra was given the name of Hemp itself. This is so because at that early stage Ephedra had no name of its own so that the designation of Hemp was transferred onto Ephedra… (Mahdihassan, 1982). Mahdihassan notes that in later times cannabis became known under the more generally used name of Ho-Ma. Writing sometime prior to the discovery of the archaeological find of remnants from both cannabis and Ephedra at the Haoma temple in Margiana, as well as amongst the IE tribes in China, and recognizing the modern use of Ephedra in Haoma preparations, Mahdihassan concludes; Aryan ascetics must have … come into contact with those of China with the results that the Chinese name, Ho-ma, for Ephedra, as also its energizing properties, were communicated to their Aryan compatriots. As a result, Ho-Ma, as Hao-Ma is found in Avesta while Ho-ma became So-Ma in Sanskrit; it is known that H̃^(′) mutates into ‘S’. This in brief is the etymology of the names Homa and Soma. It is natural to expect that the plant would be known first… and later the name of the plant Soma would be transferred on to the juice which is also called Soma (Mahdihassan 1982). Mahdihassan was very close, but contrarily, the later Margiana find “shows that Haoma’s preparation was a temple activity, along with extracting of juices from poppy, hemp and ephedra. It is clear that the whole consumable was called ‘hom’ and that the word did not correspond to the name of a specific ingredient. Among the effects of the ephedra itself was to speed up the metabolism and raise the blood pressure” (Mirfendereski, 2005). Mixed with cannabis and/or opium it must have held considerable mind bending effects. Thus, it seems likely that the name hu ma, which originated as a term for “cannabis” Cannabis was believed to have been couriered along the ancient route between the IE tribes in China, with their counterparts in BMAC, by IE Scythian traders. Interestingly one of the names of the Scythians from this area and time, was the Haomavarga, the “Haoma gatherers,” and they were criticized by Zoroastrian writers for burning haoma as well as drinking it.

In relation, it is important to note that both braziers and ritual vessels have been found at Scythian sites, that showed evidence of cannabis residues. This includes golden goblets that tested positive for both cannabis and opium, that the Russian archaeologist Anton Gas has suggested were used for the ritual consumption of haoma. Zoroaster, as noted, took the polytheistic religion of the generation prior, through a number of innovative reforms, creating something closer to Monotheism, or Dualism. A major part of these reforms included drastic changes to the Haoma ritual, which from ancient accounts was a rather orgiastic event. Zoroastrian mythology has it that the prophet Zoroaster was con-ceived after his body came down to earth through heavenly rain, which brought forth plants that were consumed by cows belonging to the people selected to become his parents. The cows gave milk which was pressed with Haoma and drunk by the prophet’s parents, who later conceived him while making love for the first time (Yasna 9.13). In light of this auspicious introduction it is curious to note that since the 19th century the view has been that Zoroaster condemned the Haoma ritual. The view that Zoroaster rallied against the Haoma cult is based on the following two verses. A thorough analysis of them, and the discussion they have engendered amongst religious scholars offers some very interesting insights into the matter: Identification of cannabis is indicated in Yasna 32.14 reference to its fibrous qualities “The ‘glutton’ and the ‘poets’ deposit their guiding thoughts here in this cord work.” This is also interesting in regard to the ritual weaving done in the cults of Cybelle, Asherah and Scythian groups that have been mentioned. Zoroaster is indicated specifically in opposition to the Scythian groups, as we shall see. Dr. Ali Jafarey, who believes the original Haoma recorded in the Yashts was a cannabis-based preparation which Zoroaster prohibited, wrote of these verses: “Zarathustra condemns ‘Dûraosha’ (Y.2.14). This word is definitely an epithet of Haoma alone and of no other object in the Avesta. Paradoxically, Zarathustra is shown by the composer/narrator of the Hom Yasht to be praising it by using this very word ‘Dûraosha.’ How could he have a double standard?!?! The word literally means “far-from-death” and also “far-from-intellect.” In another Gathic stanza, Y.48.10 Zarathustra calls it “mûthrem mada…” literally “intoxicating urine” (Y.48:10)” ( Jafarey , 2000). This view has prevailed with a number of scholars as well as", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634243995_cleaned.txt:183:cac92db863c9", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 2133, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634243995_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634243995", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634243995_cleaned", "chunk_index": 184, "text": "definitely an epithet of Haoma alone and of no other object in the Avesta.

This view has prevailed with a number of scholars as well as historians of the Zoroastrian faith. Daryoush Jahanian notes that “The text of the Gathas clearly indicates that in the rituals of the pre-Zoroastrian faith it [Haoma] was consumed by the princes (Kavis) and priests (Karapans), and caused them to behave irrationally. Zarathustra has derided and condemned the Haoma ritual by mentioning its epithets as invincible (!), and wisdom wasting (Dura Osham) (Y.32.14) and intoxicant (Madahya) (Y.48.10)” (Daryoush, 2005). This has been a longstanding view “It is therefore the haoma cult that Zarathustra is fighting” (Nyberg,1938). This has been a difficult issue for many orthodox Zoroastrians to reconcile with their current religious practice, as a form of the Haoma ritual has continued down to the present day. Jafarey’s claims that the pre-Zoroastrian version of the Haoma contained cannabis, has caused Jafarey to be viewed as a very controversial figure amongst fellow members of his faith. Homage to Haoma! Good (is) Haoma, well set up (is) Haoma, set up straight, good, healing according to the established rules, of good shape, giving good invigoration, an obstruction-smasher, golden-colored with pliable twigs, the best when they drink (him) and the best flight-maker for the breath-soul. (Yasna .9.16) I call down, O golden one, your intoxication and your might and your obstruction-smashing power, your talent, your healing, your furthering, your increasing, your strength in the whole body, your all-adorned wisdom. (I call) down (all) that so that I may go forth among the living beings commanding at will, overcoming hostilities, conquering the Lie! (Yasna 9.17). R.C. Zaehner noted in Dawn and Twilight of Zoroastrianism “It seems contrary to the evidence of the history of religion that a cult which has been fervently denounced by the founder of a religion should have been adopted … by that founder’s earliest disciples” (Zaehner, 1961). As Zoroastrian scholar Mary Boyce, Professor of Iranian Studies at the University of London, also noted: In this case the assumption of fervent denunciation was based on a Gathic verse Y.48.10: “When, O’Mazda … wilt thou smite the filth (muthra-) of this intoxicant (mada-), with which out of enmity, the pagan priests … deceive…” The term mada- is, however of wide application, and can be used of anything which exhilarates the spirits; and in view of the honored place enjoyed by haoma in Zoroastrianism it seems that the mada condemned here by the prophet must be something else perhaps a debilitating drug such as opium", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634243995_cleaned.txt:184:e9f76a84cfe8", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 2134, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634243995_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634243995", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634243995_cleaned", "chunk_index": 185, "text": "based on a Gathic verse Y.48.10: “When, O’Mazda … wilt thou smite the filth (muthra-) of this intoxicant (mada-), with which out of enmity, the pagan priests … deceive…” The term mada- is, however of wide application, and can be used of anything which exhilarates the spirits; and in view of the honored place enjoyed by haoma in Zoroastrianism it seems that the mada condemned here by the prophet must be something else perhaps a debilitating drug such as opium or hemp, which enslaves those who take it in chains of addiction. The words he uses are very strong (for muthra literally means either excrement or urine), and evidently expressed the harshest condemnation. The only other piece of positive evidence adduced from the Gathas for the prophet’s condemnation of the haoma cult comes from an obscure verse Y.32.14, where amid a puzzling account of evil-doing the term duraosa occurs. This is a word of disputed meaning, which is known only as an epithet of haoma; but since translations of the Gathic passages in which it occurs differ widely, no sound deductions can be drawn from its implications there. As for negative evidence, there is the fact there is no explicit reference to haoma in the Gathas. Considering the character of these hymns, this is a weak argument to rely on (Boyce, 1982). Now, Boyce here seems to suggest that the condemnation were against substances like cannabis and opium, and Yasna 32:14 uses the epithet Dûraosha to identify them, an epithet that elsewhere is only used in reference to haoma, but in this case it is not haoma, which she sees as something that would not have had the negative connotations she associates with cannabis and opium. However, this may well be more of an indication of Boyce’s own personal bias about drugs, as current evidence makes an extremely plausible case for both cannabis and opium being used in the original preparations of haoma. However, Mircea Eliade felt that recent “research has shown that the haoma ritual … was not condemned by Mazdaism [Zoroastrianism], not even in the Gathas.… It seems … that Zarathustra primarily opposed the excess of orgiastic rites, which involved countless blood sacrifices and immoderate absorption of haoma” (Eliade, 1978). “The violent hallucinations it [Haoma] engendered were probably intensified by the sight of blood” (Messadié & Romano, 1996). It has been suggested that Zoroaster “made modifications … in the rituals…” (Boyce, 1990). Modifying her earlier view, Boyce explained: It seems very possible that Zoroaster … did this because he regarded haoma as potentially dangerous in its potency to people (cf. his probable denunciation of it, as mada-, in Y. 48.10). An extract from it was drunk by warriors to stimulate their battle lust, and (on Vedic evidence) it was prominent in the cult of warlike Indra, to Zoroaster a daêva [demon].… If then he restricted its use in", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634243995_cleaned.txt:185:7ff6b0210def", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 2135, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634243995_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634243995", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634243995_cleaned", "chunk_index": 186, "text": "the rituals…” (Boyce, 1990).

This brings us to some very interesting points; first it should be noted that Boyce had varied opinions on Yasna 48.10, in the above reference she seems more willing to accept the insulting reference of mada “intoxicating urine” and this as a possible reference to “a dehibilitating drug such as opium or hemp” both of which have been likely identified at the site of a pre-Zoroastrian Haoma Temple in BMAC. In relation to this it is interesting to return to the work of Dr. Ali Jafarey who believed that “the pre-Gathic Haoma was most probably ‘bhang’ and that the post-Gathic priests, wanting to retain their pre-Gathic rituals, substituted it with ‘Ephedra,’ the present plant used in the Haoma ritual. I repeat, the present Haoma twigs used is not the original pre-Gathic plant. It is a substitute and devoid of the harms the original had” ( Jafarey , 2000). A look at the other verse which has been identified as evidence of Zoroaster’s prohibition of the cannabis in the Haoma offers evidence that collaborates with Jafarey’s controversial solution to the debate: Some have seen this reference as a condemnation of cattle sacrifice, but as this continued unfettered throughout the period, and even Zoroaster took part in such rites, this must not have been too much of a concern for the Persian reformer. Obviously there was more than this at issue in the Yasna 32.14 reference. In the prevailing religious tradition, Zarathustra probably found that the practice of sacrificing cattle, combined with the consumption of haoma (intoxicating drinks), led to orgiastic excess. Zarathustra in his reforms, did not, as some scholars would have it, abolish all animal sacrifice but simply the orgiastic and intoxicating rites that accompanied it. The haoma sacrifice, too, [after Zoroaster’s reforms] was to be thought of as a symbolic offering. It may have [originally] consisted of unfermented drink or an intoxicating beverage or a plant (Hoiberg, et al., 2000). Henrik Nyberg saw the Yasna 32.14 as evidence of a new cult in which the “haoma", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634243995_cleaned.txt:186:e7f4dbe67c21", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 2136, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634243995_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634243995", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634243995_cleaned", "chunk_index": 187, "text": "to orgiastic excess.

The haoma sacrifice, too, [after Zoroaster’s reforms] was to be thought of as a symbolic offering. It may have [originally] consisted of unfermented drink or an intoxicating beverage or a plant (Hoiberg, et al., 2000). Henrik Nyberg saw the Yasna 32.14 as evidence of a new cult in which the “haoma … ‘is brought to flames,’” instead of consumed as a consecrated beverage, and this new cult vied for power with Zoroaster (Nyberg, 1938). Similarly, the respected religious scholar R.C. Zaehner, saw the reference in Yasna 32.14 as not condemning cattle sacrifice, but likewise “a sacrament involving the immolation of the Haoma plant” (Zaehner, 1961). Zaehner notes that the sacrifice of the Bull was not at issue for the Persian reformer, as in Yasna 29.7 Zoroaster himself refers to the “sacred formula of the oblation of fat,” indicating a ritual involving the fat of an animal which had been immolated. This view has been shared by other sources as well, “Zoroaster … condemns certain barbarian heretics who ‘burn’ the Haoma rather than drink it” (Bey, 2004). In Incense and Poison Ordeals in the Ancient Orient Allen Godbey expands on this theme, giving even clearer indications as to what was being burnt: Zarathustra … was protesting without avail against the ancient Aryan intoxicant haoma or soma. The Sanskrit literature makes this religious narcotic all but omnipotent, and invokes it as a god, a great warrior conquering all enemies of man, a cure for every ill. Among the Iranic peoples this haoma seems to have been bhang, or Indian hemp, for Herodotus (iv. 75) tells us that the Iranic Scythians … burned Indian hemp in their religious exercises, until bystanders were intoxicated with their fumes. In India the soma was the juice of a certain milkweed in some districts, but others insist that the bruised green leaves of hemp provide the orthodox soma (Godbey, 1930). So it was the burning of Haoma that was at issue, which if it were cannabis, as has been suggested by literary, archaeological and other historical evidence, would make much more sense. Likewise Gérald Messadié and Marc Romano in reference to “sacrifices and the ritual consumption of haoma” have noted that as this was the long standing practice to which Zoroaster would have been exposed from the early stages of his life onwards. “In his youth Zoroaster may have participated in the ecstatic hemp ceremonies of Scythian shamans” (Messadie & Romano, 1996). In a rejection of these cultic activities the “Zoroastrian cult banned the use of intoxicants and haoma (soma), probably the old Persian name for hashish” (Bowles, 1977). The Scythians, as discussed in Chapter 3, burned cannabis and inhaled its fumes, as well as prepared the Haoma", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634243995_cleaned.txt:187:e3d98985bf8d", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 2137, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634243995_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634243995", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634243995_cleaned", "chunk_index": 188, "text": "to which Zoroaster would have been exposed from the early stages of his life onwards. “In his youth Zoroaster may have participated in the ecstatic hemp ceremonies of Scythian shamans” (Messadie & Romano, 1996).

The Scythians, as discussed in Chapter 3, burned cannabis and inhaled its fumes, as well as prepared the Haoma beverage from it. Their transvestite priests prophesied while weaving from spindles, similar to the “cord work” condemned by Zoroaster. Just as the Qedeshim came to be rejected in Judaism, we see a similar rejection of homosexual acts in Zoroastrianism. From the descriptions of their religious practices it is clear they were practicing the older pre-Zoroastrian form of Persian polytheistic nature worship. As Victor Sarianidi notes: “In the Avesta one finds numerous references to the fact the settled Zoroastrians had constant contacts with the nomadic Scythians who are mentioned under the name of Saka in the ancient Persian inscriptions…. The Scythian element played an important role in Zoroastrianism and … it … emerged in direct contact with the Scythian environment” (Sarianidi, 1998). It seems clear that it was this older practice of burning Haoma, as had been done by the Scythians and their ancestors for millennia, which the “new” Zoroastrian religion was rallying against, rather than a new competing cult that was burning Haoma, as Nyberg suggested. Godbey’s comments about the Scythian’s burning hemp/Haoma in relation to those of Zaehner’s and Yasna 32.14 give clear indications that this was the core issue for Zoroaster’s reforms. Thus Zoroaster’s reforms are on par with those of the earlier Hebrew reformer Moses, who similarly rallied against the influences of the polytheistic Canaanite fertility cult in the Golden Calf incident and the orgiastic rites taking place. Gone from Zoroastrian worship were the Old Gods and orgiastic rites, all future Haoma sacrifice would come via the placebo sacrament void of its former entheogenic effects, and offered ritualistically to Zoroaster’s one supreme God, Ahura Mazda: In this transference, Indra, a revered deity of the old pantheon, and the former celebrated recipient of haoma offerings, becomes in Zoroastrianism the leader of “false gods” (which refers to virtually all gods other than Ahura Mazda, Zoroaster’s supreme deity). “Indra was undoubtedly associated with Haoma … in this religion against which Zarathustra rebelled – Indra is invoked by the Mitanni Aryans in 1380 B.C. – but he was dethroned and made a demon by Zarathustra” (Parpola, 1995). In the Vendidad, Indra is identified as one of the six chief demons; thus, in the eyes of Zoroaster and his new faith, Indra is the opponent of order, truth, and righteousness.

From what has been stated, it clearly emerges that the appearance of Zarathustra in the ancient Arian milieu, that is widely similar to the Vedic-Indian, brought with it a complete upheaval. Zarathustra arises as a representative of a new religion contrary to the ancient Aryan religion. Not only that he condemned bloody sacrifices and haoma intoxication, but rather with him we seek the ancient names of deities in vain. They were replaced by spiritual entities, the so-called Amesa Spentas, the “holy immortals.” After the results of the latest research, it can certainly no longer be doubted that the Amesa Spentas represent a spiritualising reinterpretation of the gods of the Indo-Iranian society (Widengren, 1965). Although some figures from the earlier pantheon remained on as the Amesa Spentas, many more of the other long standing Aryan deities, such as Indra the original Lord of haoma, were transformed into demons through the words of Zoroaster and the cult which formed around his teachings. Meanwhile in India, in this time period, Indra was still held as supreme deity, and offerings of soma were still dedicated to him. Indra would however see a similar fall from grace, coinciding with the loss of the original soma identity, a few centuries later, as I have discussed in detail in Cannabis and the Soma Solution (2010). The difficulty of many Zoroastrians in accepting the evidence of the reality of Zoroaster’s reforms of the Haoma ritual, in light of its continued use, is on par with that of Christians who have a hard time reconciling the conflicting texts of the Hebrew Bible and New Testament, with the wrathful, jealous Jehovah of the Old, and the forgiving father of the New. In the case of the Bible, it is clearly due to the texts being composed by different authors, from different times, with different religious beliefs and practices. As Dr. Ali Jafarey explains, “The same holds true about the Avesta, ‘the Sacred Books of the Zoroastrians’” ( Jafarey, 2000). Like many ancient myths and religious texts, it is likely that the accounts in the Avesta were passed down as an oral tradition, a reason for them being in verse, long before they were written down, which likely first took place “during the Achaemenian period (550- 330 BCE) when the Iranians learned how to read and write” ( Jafarey, 2000). In 321 BCE the collection suffered a disaster from Alexander’s invasion of Iran, which put an end to the Achaemenian Empire, and devastated the royal treasuries in which the Avesta was reportedly kept.", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634243995_cleaned.txt:189:1d4d6f3a1016", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 2139, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634243995_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634243995", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634243995_cleaned", "chunk_index": 190, "text": "in the Avesta were passed down as an oral tradition, a reason for them being in verse, long before they were written down, which likely first took place “during the Achaemenian period (550- 330 BCE) when the Iranians learned how to read and write” ( Jafarey, 2000). In 321 BCE the collection suffered a disaster from Alexander’s invasion of Iran, which put an end to the Achaemenian Empire, and devastated the royal treasuries in which the Avesta was reportedly kept. During the Parthian period (250 B.C.-224 CE) an effort began to collect what remained in scattered records and the memories of the priest class. This considerable task was completed and the collection was collated, augmented, and canonized centuries later during the reign of the Sasanian King Chosroes I in about 560 CE. There was a Pahlavi translation and commentary created for every Avestan text and it was these Pahlavi renderings which the later priests counted on for expounding the religion. As the original language of Avesta became less and less utilized, it eventually became a mystical divine dialect that was not only unknown to the common people, but even the Sasanian and post-Sasanian priests. The collapse of the theocratic Sasanian Empire in 651 CE left the Zoroastrian church without its dominating royal support, and the whole system, including the Avestan and Pahlavi scriptures, began to fall apart. Nevertheless much of the collection survived as late as the 10th century CE, a period during which many of the Pahlavi scriptures were written – also revised to suit the times – in a rather salvage operation. It is estimated that between one third to one fourth of the entire collection has been salvaged. The extant Avesta, mostly religious, has been re-shaped, somewhat casually, sometimes after the 10th century, to make a little more than six books. ( Jafarey, 2000) Jafarey suggests that the Gathas, the texts attributed directly to Zoroaster “miraculously suffered no loss. We have the entire divine message of Zarathustra – fresh and inspiring – in the very words of the Teacher, a feature none of the ancient religions can boast of… The … Gathas … [are] the only doctrinal documents and … the remaining parts of the extant Avesta and Pahlavi writings … have their ethical, historical, geographical, and anthropological values. They are, nevertheless, of significant help in better understanding the Staota Yesnya from philological and sometimes philosophical points of view. And they are a part and parcel of the rich Iranian Heritage” ( Jafarey, 2000). The … post-Gathic period, clearly shows that Zarathustra … [the author] of the Gathas, did not recite any “Yasna Liturgy” to perform the haoma ceremony. He only sang his Gathas, the only liturgy, before a fire-altar. It also shows the way the traditional priests brought in their age-old haoma cult into the Good Religion.

This time it was not “bhang” or another strong intoxicant but a very mild substitute, ephedra. The Yasht mentions this mildness:”‘Indeed all other intoxicants (maidhyâongho) are accompanied by wrath of the bloody standard but the intoxicant (madho) of Haoma has the right calm following it. Its intoxication gives lightness.” It is acknowledged as an intoxicating drink and is compared with other intoxicants. The substitute “Ephedra” was soothing, indeed. Haoma was re-introduced to continue to be “central to the [expanded] Yasna liturgy” ( Jafarey, 2000). As Jafarey tried to explain to his detractors “No one is <<attacking the ritual use of Haoma. > > It has already been attacked and well attacked. Zarathustra was/is the first, foremost, and best to attack the ritual and/or any other use of the haoma dûraosha, the wisdom wasting drink” ( Jafarey, 2000). It is true that haoma was an integral part of the Daevayasna rituals. It is true that since the composition of the Later Avesta, particularly the Haoma Yasht (Yasna 9-11), haoma (the substitute) has been <<central to the Yasna liturgy. _(>) > It is true that in the Gathas, the original Haoma, bhang or any other instant intoxicant, stands rejected and condemned. It is equally true that the Sublime Songs, with their simple and sublime rituals, cannot accommodate the elaborate Haoma ceremony in any form ( Jafarey, 2000). The Haoma plant has a checkered history associated with it. Although the original identity of the plant has been obliterated through the antiquity, the plant is generally regarded as one of ephedra species. It is clearly evident from the Haoma yasht that the consecration of Haoma is a pre-Zarathustrian ritual. However history has evolved it as a central sacrament in the Zarathustrian traditional ritual. The twigs of haoma plant are ceremonially consecrated for use in the preparation of parahaoma. It is the enactment of straining of the crushed haoma and the pomegranate twigs with consecrated water that constitutes the ritual of parahaoma. (Bagli, 2005) The linguists long ago noticed that in the ancient parts of the Avesta it is said that in the beginning the Prophet rejected this narcotic beverage but then it was included in his religious doctrine as one of its main cults.

It seems that this was the compelling reason that made Zoroaster change his first decision and include this beverage as one of the main ritual ceremonies of his doctrine. …Zoroaster was the product of the pagan community that was represented by that part of Iranian paganism which is best studied on the basis of the … material of Margiana and Bactria.… The temples of Margiana and Bactria substantiate that the main cults that were practiced in this area were: (1) fire worship, (2) the libation of hallucinogenic drinks of the soma-haoma type, (3) and probably, the worship of water. In other words, the same cults that later became the main elements of the origin of Zoroastrianism (Sarianidi, 1998). Patrick McGovern, a Professor of Anthropology and Scientific Director of the Biomolecular Archaeology Laboratory for Cuisine, Fermented Beverages, and Health at the University of Pennsylvania Museum in Philadelphia, referring to the work of Sarianidi at the Bactria Margiana Archaeological Complex has suggested in Uncorking the Past: The Quest for Wine, Beer, and Other Alcoholic Beverages (2009) that soma/haoma was likely a wine or mead-like infusion of cannabis. McGovern based his view on later Zoroastrian accounts, such as the Book of Arda Wiraz, which has cannabis (bhanga, or mang) mixed into wine. “From a chemical standpoint, the advantage of using an alcoholic beverage is that it dissolves the plant alkaloids” (McGovern, 2009). When I first considered wine as the most likely vehicle for haoma, it was under the assumption that the Margiana sites were within the sphere of the wine culture that is so well attested to in the Fergana Valley, even deeper in Central Asia…. The archaeological and botanical evidence from the … excavations provide new clues for identifying haoma, at least in prehistoric Central Asia. If we accept Sarianidi’s premise that a special beverage was being prepared … with the reading that wine and a hallucinogen were mixed together in the Arda Wiraz story, then the evidence of ephedra, hemp and poppy pollen in the pottery vessels … begins to make sense … these plants… have been well known since antiquity as medicinal and narcotic agents in Central Asia…. With more archaeological and chemical investigation, we should be able to re-create the ancient haoma/soma or central Asian grog, which was probably much stronger than modern versions (McGovern, 2009).

In relation, it is interesting to note that the Vedic God most associated with Soma, Indra, also received offerings of wine. Michael Witzel, Professor of Sanskrit at Harvard University and the editor of the Harvard Oriental Series has noted: “When Alexander [the Great] came across the vines in the eastern Hindu Kush, he immediately concluded that this area must have been that of Dionysus. Indeed, the inhabitants of Nuristan and Kashmir (both before Islam) and of the modern pagan Kalash Land (north-western Pakistan) still grow vines and press grapes there each fall. The new wine is still dedicated to Indra” (Witzel, 2012). As Dr. Richard Stoneman, a professor of classics and ancient history, describes of the Greek connection in The Greek Experience of India: From Alexander to the Indo-Greeks: “It is sometimes argued that this Dionysus is a form of Indra as first king, culture-hero of the Aryans, warrior-leader and bringer of agriculture. Martha Carter produces some compelling evidence that Alexander’s expedition may have wandered into the Indrakun festival in the Kafir lands, in November or January, which involved a dancer dressed as a horned goat, behaving lewdly, while wine was pressed and drunk” (Stoneman, 2019). Both Mircea Eliade, and Erwin Rohde, one of the great German classical scholars of the 19th century, suggested a role for cannabis in the formation period of Dionysus cult. More recently Professor of classics, Carl Ruck, has suggested that “Since the wine of Dionysus is a mediation between the god’s wild herbal ancestors and the civilized phenomenon of his cultivated and manufactured manifestation in the product fermented from the juice of the grape, it is most probable that this was the way in which the Greeks incorporated hemp into their pharmacopoeia” (Ruck, 2007). (As we will discuss later Dionysus, as well, has his own overlap into the Jewish conceptions of their god). Such infusions were known in ancient Greece, and these as well are generally believed to have contained cannabis, under the names “thalassaegle,” “potammaugis” and “gelotophyllis” which were recorded by Democritus (circa 460 BCE.) and later referred to by Pliny. “The gelotophyllis of Pliny … a plant drunk in wine among the Bactrians, which produced immoderate laughter, may very well be identical with hemp, which still grows wild in the country around the Caspian and Aral Seas” (Houtsma, et al., 1936/1993).

Pliny (23-79 CE) quotes the following description from Democritus: The Thalassaegall he speaks of as being found on the banks of the river Indus, from which circumstance it is also known as potamaugis. Taken in drink it produces delirium, which presents to the fancy visions of a most extraordinary nature. The theangelis, he says, grows upon Mount Libanus in Syria, upon the chain of mountains called Dicte in Crete, and at Babylon and Susa in Persia. An infusion of it imparts powers of divination to the Magi. The geolotophyllis, is a plant found in Bactriana , and on the banks of the Borysthenes. Taken internally with myrrh and wine all sorts of visionary forms present themselves, excite the most immoderate laughter. Interestingly, Bactria, mentioned in the quote from Pliny, is part of the Bactria Margiana Archaeological Complex (BMAC), a site where as we have seen, the Russian archaeologist Victor Sarianidi has claimed to have found ancient temples where there was evidence of cannabis, ephedra and opium in the preparation of haoma. Banging on About !Part of the reason for the confusion regarding Zoroaster’s relationbegins to take precedent in the Magi literature at the time of Zoroaster’s prohibitions, banga,3 a term that is still in use to this day in both Persia and India (bhang), and is generally used to describe cannabis and its products, although this has not always been the case. As with the identification of Haoma and Soma, there is debate surrounding the identity of the plant designated by banga, and its Pahlavi counterpart mang. There is considerable confusion regarding bhang and mang, in both its method of use and identity. In 1938 the renowned Swedish Orientalist and historian of religion, Henrik Samuel Nyberg wrote the following regarding the role of bhanga in the Zoroastrian religion, which he identified with cannabis, as had a number of other historians: As shall be discussed, Nyberg went on to describe the use of cannabis by a variety of Zoroastrian heroes, as well as detailing the later rejection of the ritual use of cannabis by the Parsi, as indicated in the surviving Zoroastrian documents. Considering that cannabis is still known both in Indian and Persia under the names bhang, banj, bang, this interpretation of the Avestan texts seemed clear upon a first reading; as time went on however, the matter has become considerably confused. Some sources have come to see the Avestan banha, or bhanga and the Pahlavi mang, as references to henbane or datura. As we", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634243995_cleaned.txt:194:d2872702cd29", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 2144, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634243995_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634243995", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634243995_cleaned", "chunk_index": 195, "text": "rejection of the ritual use of cannabis by the Parsi, as indicated in the surviving Zoroastrian documents.

Some sources have come to see the Avestan banha, or bhanga and the Pahlavi mang, as references to henbane or datura. As we shall see the more logical and general view is that “banga,” “banha” and “mang,” all with “an” in them, follow in league with other terms for cannabis in languages which originated from Indo-European dialects; English, cannabis; French, chanvre; German hanf; Indian sana and bhang, Avestic baŋha etc… Much of the debate on the issue was raised by the Iranist and linguist Walter Bruno Henning. In his virulent rejection of H.S. Nyberg’s view, Henning put forward that the Avestic baŋha- and the Middle Persian mang did not mean “hemp,” and that they instead referred to “henbane.” Henning’s view was that the New Persian bang did not acquire the meaning “hemp” before the 12th century (Henning, 1951). And of the role of cannabis in the Avestan literature? “There is nothing here to show that Zoroaster so much as knew of the existence of hemp” (Henning, 1951). Further, Henning asserted that it “is very far from certain that the Avestan word banha is connected at all with Pahlavi, mang, Persian bang” (Henning, 1951). There is little support for this view, among Iranists or linguists. Most preposterous of Henning claims is the statement that: “The derivatives of Indian hemp known as bang, hasis and so on, were not known in Iran anywhere before the eleventh century of our era at the earliest. Acquaintance with Indian hemp is ultimately due to the Muslim conquest of India in the first years of that century” (Henning, 1951). Henning ignores the fact that Zoroaster lived among Scythian groups who we know used cannabis from both written (Herodotus) and now, archaeological, evidence. As well, in regard to the claim there was no awareness of hemp’s intoxicating properties till the 11th century, this is discounted by the works of the 5th century north Armenian monk Eznik, who lived amongst the Zoroastrians (and preached against their religion). Eznik was clearly familiar with cannabis, referring to its medicinal value, as well as a treatment for “wantonness” (Eznik, Book I. 68). After going through Henning’s sources, it seems he was only able to find references supporting his view as far back as the Islamic period; the rest of his claim is based on his mistaken assumption that mang/bang was a potentially toxic substance. Henbane’s designations as “bang” is clearly the later, and not original situation. Prof. Franz Rosenthal, who was a well known expert in medieval and ancient Middle Eastern cultures and languages,", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634243995_cleaned.txt:195:58bb9fc9a799", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 2145, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634243995_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634243995", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634243995_cleaned", "chunk_index": 196, "text": "a treatment for “wantonness” (Eznik, Book I. 68).

Henbane’s designations as “bang” is clearly the later, and not original situation. Prof. Franz Rosenthal, who was a well known expert in medieval and ancient Middle Eastern cultures and languages, explained: “As is well known, banj, in its pre-Islamic history, represented, in fact, ‘hemp’” (Rosenthal, 1971). However “in the usage of [banj in] Muslim times, it was commonly the scientific word for “henbane,” … Physicians and scientists appear to have been by and large consistent in their usage of banj for henbane”(Rosenthal 1971). It was in later times, “Among the Persians the Indian name in the form bang became the general term for narcotic and was given to the henbane” (Houtsma, et al., 1936/1993). Thus the Persian term for cannabis was later borrowed and applied to henbane, but this happened, in the opinion of Rosenthal and others, after the conquest of Islam. In Haoma and Harmaline, David Flattery suggests that both the Haoma and bhang, in the Zoroastrian references, can be identified with the harmaline-producing plant Syrian rue, Peganum harmala. Although it seems likely that Syrian rue, or Harmaline as this duo prefers to have it called, was an additive to incense braziers and other concoctions in the ancient world, the identification of it with bhang is wholly hypothetical and unsubstantiated by any historical reference whatsoever (as is the duos designation of Harmaline as the Soma/Homa).4 In respect to this, even Flattery’s own co-author Martin Schwartz disputed Flattery’s identification of mang and bhang with Syrian rue. In Schwartz’s view manglikely had a more generic meaning, “psychotropic substance,” but alternatively, one “which could give specific senses ‘henbane, datura’…” (Flattery & Schwartz 1989). Schwartz also suggested that the term mang, had indications of deception; “It may be assumed that Iranian inherited two homophonous words, manga – ‘deceit, trickery’ and *manga … ‘magic potion, hallucinogen’” (Flattery & Schwartz 1989). It should be noted that even during periods of the Zoroastrian use of cannabis, this was not at all a common practice and was far from wide spread. The use of bang/mang in the Zoroastrian period was strictly prohibited from anyone but the most elite members of that society. The secrecy surrounding the use of bang/mang is likely largely responsible for much of the confusion surrounding the terms mang and bang. In “Quests and Visionary Journeys in Sasanian Iran,” Shaul Shaked notes that the use of mang (which he saw as cannabis) for visionary quests, “was not a way open to all”: It was confined to select individuals, who would have regarded themselves as representative of the community, and who would then reveal to", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634243995_cleaned.txt:196:94b5150aa2c0", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 2146, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634243995_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634243995", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634243995_cleaned", "chunk_index": 197, "text": "elite members of that society.

Even for those people this was not a trivial experience that could be undertaken casually or easily repeated. Such journeys were rare occasions, surrounded by grave risks. The danger lay in the very fact that this was the path trodden by the dead, and would have to be brought back to life. Certain encounters along the way may put the power of endurance of the traveler to the test (Shaked, et al., 1999). Clearly, such limited and secretive use as this would have created a situation where few were even aware of the closely guarded secret of the source of Iranian revelation. The secretiveness with which bang/ mang would have been used throughout the Zoroastrian period was likely later compounded through initial Muslim prohibitions against intoxicants. Further confusion may have arisen as to bhanga’s identity may have occurred in times of shortage, and through its association with other plants used in its stead the term bhanga came to be applied to a variety of intoxicating plants. A similar situation can be seen with both soma and haoma. Undoubtedly, Datura and Henbane were, and still are, sometimes added by unscrupulous vendors to preparations of bhang, to increase the effects of weaker concoctions when good cannabis is not available, and this may have generated confusion at some point. In later Persian times the “fedayeen were always described as using beng, or hemp, and henbane, mixed” (Burman, 1987). There were definitely distinguishing factors between unadulterated hemp products and preparations made with henbane, as the use of cannabis could be associated “with fits of rage … especially if there is an admixture of any preparation of henbane” (Houtsma, et al., 1936/1993). In reference to the use of hashish in early 20th century Islam it has been noted that “sometimes to increase its intoxicating effect it is mixed with the seeds of the henbane (hyocyamus muticus, sekaran) or stramonium (datura)” (Houtsma, et al., 1936/1993). Likewise in India, “Datura … seeds are sometimes mixed with Sidhi (Bhang) … to induce delirious intoxication, and with other narcotics to intensify their actions” (Gerloczy, 1897). In regard to cannabis in India “the question of adulterants, especially datura must always be borne in mind” (Smith & Taylor, 1920). The use of bhang to designate intoxicating plants in general seems to be much more identifiable in the Persian language than the Indian,", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634243995_cleaned.txt:197:9e0b410f5b59", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 2147, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634243995_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634243995", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634243995_cleaned", "chunk_index": 198, "text": "sekaran) or stramonium (datura)” (Houtsma, et al., 1936/1993).

The use of bhang to designate intoxicating plants in general seems to be much more identifiable in the Persian language than the Indian, and as the term in both languages is now generally assumed as designating cannabis, it seems unlikely that bhang originated as a generic term, and this use of the word developed in later times, otherwise these multiple meanings would have carried over into the Indian language. This linguistic situation has never been adequately explained by any of the researchers who see the term as originating as a generic name for psychoactive plants in general. Proponents of the ‘henbane’ theory offer no reasonable examples opposing the more generally accepted view that mang, bang were references to cannabis, nor do they adequately explain why if this were the case in the ancient world, how the designation of cannabis as bhanga came about in both the ancient Persian and Indian dialects. “Bhang” as “cannabis” has clearly been the long standing view; As James Samuelson noted in the 19th century in The History of Drink: “A … very deleterious drink called “banga” is mentioned in the Zend-Avesta.… Like the modern bang, referred to … in India, it is believed to have been extracted from the hemp plant (Cannabis sativa)” (Samuelson,1880). In the Avesta, Bleek and von Spiegel recorded, “Bana is the Cannabis sativa, Skr. Bhanga” (Bleek & Spiegel, 1864). As Darmesteter also noted in his translation of The Zend-Avesta; “Banga, is bang or mang, a narcotic made from hemp seed” (Darmesteter, 1880). This designation of mang, bhang as identifying cannabis has also been accepted by a variety of Zoroastrian scholars, such as Dr. Jahanian Daryoush, who refers to bhang in his essay ‘Medicine in Avesta and Ancient Iran’: “Bangha (Avesta: bhangh, Sanskrit: bhanga, Persian: Bang, hashish) It is extracted from the seeds of Cannabis Indica (hempseed or Per: shahdaneh) and has hallucinating effects. In ancient Iran it was mixed with wine to deliver anesthesia” (Daryoush, 2005). As Parvaneh Pourshariati has also noted in The Decline and Fall of the Sasanian Empire, “mang – a mixture of hemp and wine, with intoxicating properties” (Pourshariati, 2008). Referring to the variation of the “b-” in the Avestan, to the $\" \\mathrm { m } \\cdot ?$ in the Pahlavian, the authors of the Annual of Armenian Linguistics used the following examples, which also identify hemp with the terms in question, ^(∞)Zo. - roastrian Pahl. mang, bang ‘hemp’.

In reference to Zoroastrian expeditions into the world of the afterlife, Shaul Shaked noted that “The preparation of this journey was done … by administering to the officiant a dose of mang (hemp), mixed with wine” (Shaked, 1999). “Zoroaster is commonly said to have spiked the haoma with mang, which was probably hashish. It would have prolonged the intoxication and further stimulated the imagination of the drugged man. Of such are the wonders of Heaven” (Oliver, 1994). In the Zoroastrian tale “…the Artak Viraz Namak … Hell, Purgatory, and Heaven, the rewards bestowed on the good, and the punishment awaiting the sinner are here described in a vision induced by hashish” (Campbell, 2000). Referring to this same account, van Baaren and Hartman also noted the hero “imbibes an intoxicant composed of wine and hashish and after this his body sleeps for seven days and nights while his soul undertakes the journey” (van Baaren & Hartman,1980). 19th century author James Francis Katherinus also refers to the “enlightening prophet drug Bangha (Cannabis Indica), the Hashish by which the Zoroastrian priests were inspired” (Hewitt, 1901). This was also the view of Nyberg (1938), whose work we have discussed, and the German Iranist, Geo Widengren (1965), as well as more recent researchers: “The Zend-Avesta, the holy book of Zoroastrianism, which survives in fragments, dating from around 600 BCE in Persia, alludes to the use of Banga in a medical context, identified as hemp” (Russo, 2005). Possibly, having followed up on Henning’s research regarding mang, Flattery and Schwartz saw that the references Henning cited didn’t really take the identification of banj as henbane any earlier than the Islamic period. Thus in order to make their case, the co-authors decided to take it a step further, and included ancient India, with a claim that the intoxicating properties of hemp were unknown until the early medieval period there as well!: “With regards to ‘hemp’ called bhanga and sana in Sanskrit, there is no evidence for its use as an intoxicant in either India or Persia before well within the Islamic", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634243995_cleaned.txt:199:78b490202a6a", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 2149, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634243995_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634243995", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634243995_cleaned", "chunk_index": 200, "text": "identification of banj as henbane any earlier than the Islamic period.

Instead, in regard to the Indian references, Flattery and Schwartz claim all early Indian mentions of the term only refer to the fiber of the cannabis plant. The Duo even take this view regarding the Atharvaveda, reference to bhang as being amongst herbs that release one from anxiety and under the dominion of the God Soma, stating that this identifies the hemp plant’s fibrous qualities and are “due to its use as a traditional means of binding … it is also a means of fastening amulets,” which would seem to have little reference to the plant’s use as a medicine against anxiety as described in the Atharvaveda. Indeed the authors offer little in the way of evidence for their novel interpretation that the passage makes reference to fiber. The dismissal of hemp, as being purely used for fiber or “binding” and not burning, would seem to contradict the meticulous research of Flattery.… That a culture obsessed with psychoactive plants and fire rituals would be ignorant of Cannabis as either a fuel or entheogen would seem patently absurd, especially as it is mentioned explicitly in the Atharva-Veda in As well, it should also be noted that both Haoma and Soma are described as something that could be woven. Vedic references to Soma’s fibrous qualities have long been noted. In A History of Indian Literature, the authors write that: “At the consecration of the Soma-sacrifice the sacrifice ties round his girdle a belt made of hemp and reed-grass with the words ‘You are the power of Angiras [ancient fire and magic priests] soft like wool; lend me power!’ Then he binds a knot in his underclothing and says ‘you are the knot of soma’” (Winternitz & Srinivasa, 1996). “In the Sukla Yajurveda (IV.10), mekhala, the girdle, is described as ‘tying the knot of Soma.’ Is this an implication that the Soma plant had the same fibrous qualities as the hemp plant?” (Merlin, 1972).5 The assertion that there was no knowledge of cannabis’ intoxicating properties among an IE culture such as that of the authors of the Vedas is as preposterous as Henning’s statement on the same situation in Persia. Scythian contact with Zoroastrians and the more ancient Iranian religion it grew out of, is explicit, and artifacts well attest to their burning and consumption of cannabis.

Likewise in India, cannabis would have traveled there with the Indo-European authors of the Vedas, as well as Scythians who dominated Northern India for a few centuries on either side of the CE. As noted by other researchers: “In India and Iran, it [cannabis] was used as an intoxicant known as bhang as early as 1000 BC” (Goldfrank, 2002); “The narcotic properties of C. Sativa were recognized in India by 1000 BC.” (Zohary & Hopf, 2000); “The narcotic and euphoric properties of cannabis were known to the Aryans who migrated to India thousands of years ago and there is little doubt they made use of these properties” (Chopra & Chopra, 1965); Cannabis’ “narcotic properties were known in India by (1000 BCE)” (Southworth, 2005); “The use of hemp for medicinal purposes has been known in India from ancient times when it is highly probable that it was also used in a restrictive way, as an intoxicating drug” (Hassan, 1922). Despite some excellent etymological and historical research, at best Schwartz’s explanation in regards to bhanga/Soma/Homa/cannabis/harmaline adds to the linguistic confusion on the matter, and few scholars agree with his assessment on the subject. As Schwartz tries to explain away the reality of the ancient connection between cannabis, mang, bhanga and Haoma, he only digs a deeper hole. Considering my own knowledge of the data collected in the composition of this book and other projects as well (Bennett, et al., 1995; Bennett & McQueen, 2001: Bennett 2010; Bennett 2018), to suggest that cannabis was unknown in this area of the world is a curious statement indeed. These authors are suggesting that both in Persia and India, cultures which had extensive herbal knowledge, which were making hempen ropes and clothes, and which came into contact with other cultures who used cannabis as an intoxicant, had somehow let the resinous properties of its flowers escape them! As it has been noted that Zoroaster took both the Persian reliwhich indicated the extraction of cannabis from the Haoma recipe, and as the term bhanga starts to play a role around this same time period, becoming mang in later Pahlavi translations, it seems probable that there is a relationship between the two. Perhaps Zoroaster, who, according to Eliade was unhappy with the “immoderate absorption of haoma” amongst the masses who used it in nocturnal “orgiastic” rituals, decided to weaken the punch, so to speak?

The coup in this case being the removal of cannabis from the Haoma recipe, and the reinstitution of a more mildly-psychoactive placebo drink as a substitution, while the use of cannabis continued to be used secretly by Zoroaster and his selected elite. The surviving tradition clearly indicates that Zoroaster continued to utilize cannabis for his own Shamanic purposes and for initiation of a chosen few, under the name bhanga. This situation accounts for both the appearance of bhanga/mang in the Zoroastrian tradition as well as the survival of the tradition which currently recognizes Ephedra as the Hom. This scenario also substantiates the view that for a time “Haoma was under the ban of the great reformer [Zoroaster]” (Griswwold, 1923). Post-Zoroastrian reform references indicate that cannabis was infused in both wine, and in some accounts, the ephedra-only haoma that replaced the original formula. In R.V. [Rig Veda] 9.16.13, the word [bhang] is used an epithet of soma.… In Iran, modern Persians have the name bang, which corresponds to the Avestan bhanga, and Pahlavi mang. In the Artai Viraz Namak, [Ardu Viraz] mang is mentioned several times (mang, mang-i-Vistap, mang-i-Zaratuxst…), often translated as “a narcotic.” “Medical mang” (mang besaz) is mentioned in the Bundahisin 4:20, and it also states that mang-I Vistaspan was mixed with Hom (Denkard 7.4.85…)… Thus, in the Avesta or the Pahlavi texts banja, mang or bang are not considered to be identical with haoma. We have to conclude that hemp is certainly not identical with soma/haoma, although it might have been an ingredient in some preparations derived from the original soma/haoma. (Nyberg, 1995) Nyberg discounted cannabis as an ingredient in the original Haoma, based upon the appearance in Zoroastrian literature as something separate, although acknowledging at the same time, it may have been used in the preparation. This reasoning was shared by Yves Bonnefoy and Wendy Doniger (returning to the subject more than two decades after her work with Wasson)6 who also noted in reference to the identity of Haoma: “Hashish has been considered (bhanga in Iranian, bhang in Sanskrit), but a passage from the Denkart seems to contradict this suggestion, for we read that Zarathustra’s patron, King Vishtaspa, drank one day a cup of haoma mixed with hashish … so the two ingredients cannot have been the same” (Bonnefoy & Doniger, 1993). But this view would be hard to maintain in light of the fact that the shamanic use of bhanga/mang in the Zoroastrian tradition coincides with massive changes in the Haoma", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634243995_cleaned.txt:202:48ce804b1dda", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 2152, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634243995_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634243995", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634243995_cleaned", "chunk_index": 203, "text": "considered (bhanga in Iranian, bhang in Sanskrit), but a passage from the Denkart seems to contradict this suggestion, for we read that Zarathustra’s patron, King Vishtaspa, drank one day a cup of haoma mixed with hashish … so the two ingredients cannot have been the same” (Bonnefoy & Doniger, 1993). But this view would be hard to maintain in light of the fact that the shamanic use of bhanga/mang in the Zoroastrian tradition coincides with massive changes in the Haoma ritual which changed the formula, removing the cannabis and making the Haoma into a placebo sacrament with only the mildly stimulating effects produced by Ephedra remaining. Zoroaster prohibited the mass use of cannabis in the Haoma, in a revolt against the nocturnal orgiastic rites that accompanied its consumption, but then continued to use extracts of cannabis in potent preparations for shamanic trance amongst his inner circle. Clearly, as with the Indian tradition of Soma, the distinction that made any preparation Haoma in Zoroastrian times was the act of consecration, and as such the Zoroastrian sacrament maintained the name even without the plant with which its use and name originated. This brings about a number of important points. Psychoactive preparations of Haoma, from the earlier Avestan accounts, seem different in effect than those associated with the shamanic trance induced by bhanga/mang. Haoma, being a preparation of cannabis mixed with the stimulant Ephedra, was used in nocturnal rituals, where there was singing, dancing, animal sacrifices and in some cases orgiastic activities. In this scenario, the Haoma was not particularly directed at inducing a psychonaut into a shamanic trance, but rather a collective, awake, and involved shared ecstatic experience. Bhanga/mang, on the other hand, was, from the ancient accounts, used in a potent shamanic preparation that would quite literally send the devotee into a death-like coma that was filled with vivid dreamlike visions. Because of these descriptions, few researchers have considered cannabis potent enough to have been the substance in question, but this is an assumption based on dosage. Although such a powerful experience would seem unlikely to most western users of cannabis, as Dr. Michael Aldrich explains: There is a myth that pot is a mild and minor drug. Usually in context of American usage it is, but it doesn’t have to be. The hard part about expressing this, however, is that the anti marijuana people who pose visions of disaster about “hashish” or about “legalizing the stronger forms of cannabis” are also wrong. In and of itself there’s nothing wrong with cannabis being a potent hallucinogen; this has certainly accounted for its vast popularity through these many centuries. When one seeks a shaman’s drug one generally wants something more powerful than a “mild hallucinogen.” Of course, knowing when and where to use cannabis at a dosage or strength suitable for real visions is also important.

It’s obviously not a good idea to try in an unrefined social context, or when working in the fields or factory. This use of cannabis has traditionally been confined, by rational custom in ancient societies, to rituals which help define and control, measure and magnify, the raw experience (Aldrich, 1980). As it stands, in my own research, I have come across numerous references that refer to descriptions from a variety of sources detailing such experiences induced by cannabis preparations, particularly amongst 19th century occultists. Besides the well known vivid voyages into the astral realms recorded by members of le Club des Haschichins, which included such figures as Alexander Dumas, Victor Hugo, Theophile Gautier, Gerard de Nerval and Charles Baudelaire, we also have more than a dozen such accounts recorded in Cahagnet’s Sanctuary of Spiritualism (1848) which recorded the descriptions of a variety of In 1968, when I was studying marijuana in Boston, I deliberately consumed [orally] an overdose (6 grams) of potent hashish in order to experience the reaction.… The effects of the drug were felt within forty minutes and were pleasant but strong for about a half-hour. Thereafter, things became quite confusing. I could not understand what was said to me, felt physically sick, and soon was unfit to do anything but lie in bed and wait for morning. Auditory hallucinations were prominent, especially threatening voices that rose in volume to a crescendo, then faded out. For about twelve hours I remained in a stage of consciousness between sleeping and waking, marked by vivid nightmares. Lucid intervals were rare; for much of the time I did not know where I was, even thinking I was six years old and sick from measles. By morning, most of the worst symptoms had disappeared, but I had a powerful hangover that left me prostrate for another twenty-four hours. I would not willingly repeat the experience (Weil 1972). Under the proper set and setting, such as the context of religious initiation, an experienced Shaman leading a new initiate could channel such effects as described by Weil in a number of directions. In reference to Thracian Shaman, who burned cannabis in rituals, Eliade suggests that such experiences led to the belief in a “soul” that could leave the material body: Ecstatic experiences strengthened the conviction that the soul is not only autonomous but that it is capable of unio mystica with the divinity.

The separation of soul from body, determined by ecstasy, revealed … the fundamental duality of man … [and] the possibility of a purely, spiritual post-experience.… Ecstasy could … be brought on by certain dried herbs… (Eliade,1982). Later Islamic accounts refer to a potent hash oil preparation known as dūḡ-e waḥdat, which may be similar to the Persian bhanga/mang. “Hashish oil is generally consumed by thoroughly mixing a drop of it with a liter of dūḡ (a drink made from yogurt), and drinking the resulting mixture. This mixture, which is extremely potent and dangerous, is called dūḡ-e waḥdat (the dūḡ of annihilation)” (Gnoli 1979). As Encyclopedia Iranica describes: DŪḠ-EWAḤDAT “beverage of unity,” concoction made from adding hashish extract (jowhar-e ḥaīš) to diluted yogurt (Šahrī, VI, pp. 412, 423). The resulting tonic is drunk by certain mystics as a hallucinogen during their rites. ʿAlī-Akbar Dehḵodā, in his compendium of Persian proverbs and dicta (1339 Š./1960, I, p. 255), quoted a verse from Kamāl-al-Dīn Ḵojandī (d. 803/1399) in which the use of the narcotic by a Sufi sheikh is mentioned. Apparently some less scrupulous Sufis used the drink to attract followers (Šahrī, VI, p. 419) (Omidsalar, 1999). The use of dūḡ-e waḥdat has continued through to the modern-day in Iran, despite considerably harsh penalties surrounding its consumption and distribution. The preparation is also known as “bangaab” (bang = hashish ⁺ aab = water), but more commonly it is dugh (water ⁺ yogurt, scented with herbs) and powdered hashish. Dūḡ-e waḥdat is a favored libation of the dervishes). Its potential to make one unconscious has resulted in some rape cases where it was alleged to have been given to women to knock them out. (It was likely a preparation such as this that Henning referred to regarding cannabis’ non-toxicity even in extreme doses). In relation to this, it is important to note that one of the effects attributed to bhanga/mang in the Zoroastrian accounts is that it “brought about a condition outwardly resembling sleep (i.e. stard) in which targeted visions of what is believed to be a spirit existence were seen” (Flattery & Schwartz, 1989). The literal meaning of the term “stard” means “spread out, sprawled.” From the descriptions given, this state could last for more than a day. Comparatively, in 200CE , the Chinese surgeon, Hua T’o was reputed to have performed complicated operations, such as organ grafts, resectioning of intestines, laparotomies (incisions into the loin), and thoracotomies (incisions into", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634243995_cleaned.txt:205:6857f8b382c9", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 2155, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634243995_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634243995", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634243995_cleaned", "chunk_index": 206, "text": "outwardly resembling sleep (i.e. stard) in which targeted visions of what is believed to be a spirit existence were seen” (Flattery & Schwartz, 1989).

Comparatively, in 200CE , the Chinese surgeon, Hua T’o was reputed to have performed complicated operations, such as organ grafts, resectioning of intestines, laparotomies (incisions into the loin), and thoracotomies (incisions into the chest) which were rendered painless by an anesthetic prepared from cannabis resin and wine known as ma-yo (Abel, 1980) Thus, it can clearly be seen that cannabis preparations taken in higher dosages have been known to produce a state identical to those attributed to bhanga/mang in the Avestan and Pahlavian accounts. Considering the historical and etymological connections as well, cannabis is by far and wide the most obvious candidate for the ancient Zoroastrian Shamanic preparation, bhang, mang. After the time of Zoroaster’s reforms and the installation of the placebo-Haoma, bhanga/mang had to be added to the Haoma in order for visionary purposes, and the indications are Zoroaster used this method himself. As the authors of Apocalypticism in the Mediterranean World and the Near East explain: Zoroaster’s role as apocalyptic revealer is intimately tied up with the type of religious type he represents. The indication in the Gathas, particularly Yasna 43, suggest that he was an ecstatic visionary who a number of times had an overwhelming experience of the divine, the Ahura Mazda.… How was this ecstasy… brought about?… There are good reasons to assume that there were in the early Zoroastrian community … means of attaining the ecstatic vision, e.g. … the use of a specific beverage. The last one is most clearly attested to with respect to Vistaspa … [who] is visited by a divine messenger who urges him to drink a cup of wine or haoma mixed with henbane or cannabis (mang). He then falls into a deep sleep during which his soul is taken to heaven … the same procedure was used by Artay Viraz before undertaking his journey to the other world. Now it appears from a passage in Bahman Yast, based upon Avestan traditions, that a similar technique was used by Zoroaster. The beverage mentioned in Bahman Yast only contains water, but there are grounds to believe that the mention of mang has been suppressed by later tradition. A passage from the Pahlavi Videvat, hitherto not adduced in this context, supports the view that the original tradition behind the Bahman Yast knew the narcotic beverage. In IV,14 mention is made of old women bringing henbane [unlikely] or hemp to be used for abortion and the text adds that this mang either was that of “Vistaspa or Zoroaster” (Hellholm, et al., 1989). Although references to the use of mang are much more clear cut and", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634243995_cleaned.txt:206:b4452b2e1e59", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 2156, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634243995_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634243995", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634243995_cleaned", "chunk_index": 207, "text": "suppressed by later tradition.

Although references to the use of mang are much more clear cut and straight forward in the other accounts which shall be discussed, the identification of Zoroaster’s use seems to be quite veiled. Hellholm and his co-authors make an important point in their statement that “According to the Bahman Yast, Zoroaster receives from Ahura Mazda the ‘wisdom of omniscience’” which appears to be closely related to drinking the cup of ecstasy: (Hellholm, et al., 1989) A situation on which a number of Iranists have commented. “The visionary receives the divine quality of omniscience … which is thought to be transmitted in liquid form, as told in Bahman Yasht” ( Johnston, 2004). As the authors of The Encyclopedia of Apocalypticism have noted of this passage, “The expression ‘in the form of water’ in the Bahman Yast to denote the drink Zoroaster consumed before his vision does not mean that it was water but only that it was liquid” (McGinn, et al., 2000). As we shall see, the drinking of the “cup of omniscience” by Zoroaster clearly resulted in an identical shamanic trip as that attributed to the drinkers of bhanga/mang in the Zoroastrian tradition: fact, we find a reference to an otherworldly journey undertaken by Zoroaster in a short citation from the sacred tradition preserved in the Denkard. Ohrmazd and the beneficent immortals address Zoroaster with the following words “You have come to paradise (garodman); now you know the actions that are done in the corporeal world and those that will be done, even in secret” (Dk IX,28:2)(McGinn, et al., 2003). Hellholm and his co-authors relate that the respected Iranist Geo Widengren, in his German language edition Die Religionen Irans (1965) believed that mention of bhanga/mang were suppressed in the above accounts by later Zoroastrian religious writers, which would explain a lot of the confusion on the matter. A statement which left this researcher with the task of locating a copy of Widengren’s German language book Die Religionen Irans, and then acquiring translations of the relevant passages, some of which are reproduced below: [In] the Phalavi-apocalypse Bahman Yast … it is recounted … that Zarathustra assimilated the so-called “rationality of omniscience” by means of drinking water. Moreover it is recounted that, in doing this, the ‘rationality of omniscience’ was mixed with Zarathustra and this remained for seven days and nights….

The most important thing about this description is that Zarathustra, in accordance with an established Avestan tradition, adopted an intoxication technique, to put himself into a trance, during which he lies in deep sleep for seven days and nights. In Pahlavi at this point, the term for this deep sleep is xvamn; this is a “later” development of the Avestan word xvafna. It may therefore be assumed that the original Avestan tradition even used the term xvafna here (Widengren 1965). This state of xvafna was the core of both the Haoma and the mang experience. As Eliade explained, “…haoma is rich in xverenah, the sacred fluid, at once igneous, luminous and spermatic. Ahura Mazda is preeminently the possessor of xvarenah, but this ‘flame’ also springs from the forehead of Mithra8 and like a solar light emanates from the heads of sovereigns.” (Eliade, 1978). Referring to Zoroaster’s ingestion of the “cup of omniscience” Widengren wrote that in “a trance similar to that of the deep sleep, xvafna> xvamn, Zarathustra experienced his visions and heard the divine words of Ahura Mazda. It was probably also customary in the eldest congregations to induce this trance with a narcotic potion. This technique of intoxication presumably has Indo-Iranian ancestry, because it is documented in India as well” (Widengren, 1965). The tradition preserved in the Bahman Yt. does not mention the hemp potion as a physical ecstatic substance but it obviously concerns a potion, which Zarathustra partook of. It is possible that the later Pahlavi tradition thus blurred the original character of the potion, that it only states … “in the form of water … he swallowed it.” Behind this transition from wine and hemp in AVN II 29 ff. to water in the Bahman Yt., one can well assume various tendencies of the Sassanids era… Now this description in Bahman Yast is however consistent in some respects with two other visionary narratives. One account is found in the Pahlavi Rivayats to Datastan i Denik, where it is told, how Zarathustra’s guardian, Kavi Vistaspa, obtains wine mixed with a narcotic [mang] from the messenger of the gods, Neryosang. Vistaspa immediately becomes unconscious and his soul is escorted to Garodman, the paradise. This account bases itself meanwhile on an older version which we find in the Denkart. This Denkart text can be proved as an adaptation of a missing Avestan original due to the exegetical glosses, the quotes from the Avesta as well as the precious terminology.

This original version shows several discrepancies: firstly the cup, which Vistaspa is passed, contains in this case hom ut mang, being haoma and hemp (Widengren, 1965). Widengren felt that based on this similar Avestan account of Vistaspa drinking Haoma mixed with hemp, and achieving a similar mystical experience to that of Zoroaster in the Bahman Yast, that the account of Zoroaster drinking water in the Bahman Yast, was based on an earlier Avestan tradition which involved the partaking of mang, then later accounts were edited during the Sasanian period to hide this fact. [W]e have to realize that the previously quoted Pahlavi text Bahma Yt, where Zarathustra’s ecstasy with his visionary experiences is described, bases itself on Avestan material, and in actual fact predominantly on the missing Stutkar Nask. It can therefore be subject to no doubt that the Avestan tradition also knew Zarathustra as a genuine ecstatic (Widengren,1965). Accounts of Zoroaster’s shamanic flights are recorded in: Bahman Yasht 4.1-66, 5.1-10, 6.1-13, 7.1-39, 8.1-8, 9.1-8; Bundahishn 34.4-5; Denkard 8.8.22-59, 9.6, 10.11, 14.13. The suggestion that there was a connection between the mang and Haoma consumed by Vishtasp and the “water” by Zoroaster has been noted by a variety of scholars. “Since sauma [mixed with mang] was the means by which Ohrmazd [Ahuramazda] brought such vision to Zoroaster’s champion, Wishtasp, [Vistaspa] there is no reason to doubt that sauma [and mang] would also have been the means whereby Zoroaster (who as a zaotar consumed sauma [haoma] in Yasna rites) also saw into menog existence [spiritual realm] and drew from it his knowledge of Ohrmazd and his revelation” (Flattery and Schwartz, 1989). Ancient texts such as the Avesta provide evidence hemp was used in the Iranian world … to produce ecstatic states of mind. Zarathustra himself used this technique to nourish his mystique. In this he was imitating his protector, King Vishtasp, who received from the gods the cup with narcotic ingredients, “haoma and hemp.” Thanks to this “illuminating beverage” the possessed could “open the eye of the soul to obtain knowledge” – in other words, he experienced hallucinations and an intoxication that was certainly real, though considered as magico-religious. The king thought he was in this way escaping his body and sending his soul to travel in paradise. But the descriptions of the place or state of mind in question as being full of “illumination” are typical of the visions experienced by the consumer of hashish, along with a sleep like trance which obliges him", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634243995_cleaned.txt:209:2381840364b1", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 2159, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634243995_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634243995", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634243995_cleaned", "chunk_index": 210, "text": "of the soul to obtain knowledge” – in other words, he experienced hallucinations and an intoxication that was certainly real, though considered as magico-religious.

Vishtasp, the Shamanic KingThe aforementioned King Vishtasp was an instrumental figure in this was said to have happened a full decade after Zoroaster’s own revelation. Not surprisingly, Zoroaster’s initial battle with the age-old ecstatic Haoma cult was unpopular with the locals, and he had to flee the area in order to save his own life. Yasna 46 begins with a sad verse about Zoroaster leaving his homeland after rallying against the Haoma cult. The story has it that Zoroaster wandered the countryside for ten years without winning over the people to his new religious concepts. It was not until he met King Vishtasp, who converted to Zoroaster’s religion after drinking a cup of mang that the Iranian prophet’s beliefs began to take hold on a wide scale. “Vishtaspa used hemp (bhang) to obtain ecstasy: while his body lay asleep, his soul traveled to paradise” (Eliade 1978). Vishtaspa’s shamanic journey is recorded in Denkird 7.4.83-6 and Pahlavi Rivayat 48.27-32. In the ninth century text the Denkird derived from a lost Avestan source, when Vishtaspa drank bhang “he became stard (unconscious) immediately, and they led his soul to paradise and showed him the value of accepting the Religion”: To enlighten Vishtasp (and teach him)… and that he would attain a high post, permanent power, riches and food, Ohrmazd the Creator sent at the same time to the house of Vishtasp the yazat [a lesser divine being] Neryosang with a message urging … Arthavist to give to drink to Vishtasp the lightened drink that would grant the eye of whomever took it a glimpse at the spiritual world.… And speak to Arthavist: “Lord Arthavist! Take the nice plate, the nicest of all that have been made … to take, from us, Hom [Haoma] and mang…” (Denkird 7.4.84-86). Seeming to agree with Widengren about censorship of references to bhanga/mang, Vicente Dobroruka has noted, “In the Dinkard 7.4.84-86 Vishtaspa drinks a mixture of wine or haoma with some narcotic, possibly henbane [or as we have shown, hemp]. The same episode in the Zand-i Vohuman Yasn, a later redaction, has this potation replaced by water … possible evidence of the practice being rejected in later times” (Dobroruka, 2006). Gherardo Gnoli recorded: “bang was … an ingredient of the ‘illuminating drink’ (rōšngar xwarišn) that allowed Wištāsp to see the ‘great xwarrah’ and the ‘great mystery.’ This mang ī wištāspān (Pahlavi Vd. 15.14…)", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634243995_cleaned.txt:210:786b8e789e2e", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 2160, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634243995_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634243995", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634243995_cleaned", "chunk_index": 211, "text": "a mixture of wine or haoma with some narcotic, possibly henbane [or as we have shown, hemp].

It was an integral part of the ecstatic practice aimed at opening the ‘eye of the soul’ (gyān čašm….)” (Gnoli, 1979). As Widengren explained: Hemp and wine or hemp and haoma were mixed in the cup that was passed to Vistaspa … it is said that Neryosang was sent forth to let Vistaspa drink “the eye of the soul” with the view up above to the forms of existence of the heavenly beings, the illuminating potion thanks to which Vistaspa saw the great lucky splendor and “mystery.” The typical expression gyan casm, “eye of the soul,” causes problems here. One could be tempted to replace this expression with “source of life,” and this in actual fact is how it was translated, which in a pure formal philological sense is completely possible. However the expression can be explained via two points in the Denkart, where, in regards to the enlightenment, it is stated that it is of two types: on the one hand it consists of a view with the eye of the body, tan casm, on the other hand it is a view with the eye of the soul, gyan casm, which is defined as “the opening of the eye of the soul to obtain knowledge.” “The eye of the soul” means introspection. The visionary sight is conveyed to Kavi Vistaspa using a haoma potion mixed with hemp. With this his soul can repair to Garodman, [Paradise] to view the heavenly existence (Widengren, 1965). When … the Adhvaryu hands over … the Soma cup to drink … to the Hotar, he receives it with the … mantra … (By the words): “This is a good which has knowledge; here is a good which has knowledge; in me is a good which has knowledge; ruler of the eye, protect my eye” the Hotar drinks Soma from the Maitravaruna graha. 9 (Then he repeats): “The eye with the mind is called hither.” Martin Haug in his translation of this passage, noted “This formula resembles very much one of the most sacred prayers of the Parsis … which is particularly repeated when the Zotar priest (the Hotar of the Brahmans) is drinking the Homa (Soma) juice…” (Haug, 1863).

In relation, in India the drinking of bhang by devotees is still believed to open up the “eye” of Shiva, i.e. the “third-eye.” As Mary Boyce explains, the drinking of mang led to the moment of conversion for Vishtaspa: “Vistasp received … a bowl containing Hom-juice mixed with mang; when he drank this he lost consciousness and saw in a vision the glories of heaven which awaited him hereafter. On recovering his senses he accordingly accepted whole-heartedly the new teachings” (Boyce, 1982). Ormazd sent Nêrôsang: “Go to Artvahist and tell him: Put mang in the wine and give it for Vishtasp to drink.” Artvahist did so. Having drunk it, he evaporated into the field. His soul was taken to Garôtman [Paradise] to show him what he could gain if he accepted the Religion. When he woke up from the sleep, he cried to Hutôs: “Where is Zoroaster so that I may accept the Religion?” Zoroaster heard his voice, came and Vishtasp accepted the Religion. (Pahlavi Rivayat 47.27-32) Fundamental to ancient Iranian religion was a belief in two existences, the material, tangible, visible existence … and the intangible, invisible, spirit existence … Middle Persian menog, as was glimpsed by … Wishtasp [Vistaspa] by means of sauma [and mang].… All material things and creatures exist simultaneously in spirit form. These spirit forms include the double or frawahr (Avestan fravasi-) of each person, living, dead and unborn… The consumption of sauma [and mang] may have been the only means recognized in Iranian religion of seeing into menog existence before death … and is the means used by Ohrmazd when he wishes to make the menog existence visible to living persons. In ancient Iranian religion there is little evidence of concern with meditative practices which might foster development of alternative, non-pharmacological means to such vision. In Iran, vision into the spirit world was not thought to come about simply by divine grace nor as a reward for saintliness. From the apparent role of sauma in initiation rites, experience of the effects of sauma, which is to say vision of menog existence, must have at one time been required of all priests (or the shamans antecedent to them) (Flattery and Schwartz, 1989). Besides bringing back an account of the afterlife, the revelations received by Vishtaspa in this psychedelic voyage included divine knowledge about the fate of mankind, and give us the origin of the whole concept of an Apocalypse or Holy Armageddon.

Vishtaspa was one of the first to conceive of a cosmic beginning and end of history, placing himself and Zarathustra at the midpoint. Vishtaspa’s Eschatological vision was apparently prohibited literature in ancient Rome, and in the eyes of the Romans with good reason: “In the second and first century B.C. an apocalypse written in Greek was in circulation under the title Oracles of Hystapes (Hystapes is the Greek form of Vishtaspa); it was directed against Rome (whose fall was announced) but formed part of the Iranian eschatological literature” (Eliade 1978\\1982).10 Apparently, Zoroaster’s wife was not satisfied with only a secondary shamanic experience, and after hearing about Zoroaster’s visions, she prays to the Supreme Being that Zoroaster “give her his good narcotic, bangha.” Darmesteter commented on this in his 19th century translation of the relevant passages from the Den Yasht, 16.14-15: To whom the holy Hvovi (Zarathustra’s wife) did sacrifice with full knowledge, wishing the holy Zarathustra would give her his good narcotic (bangha; so-called Bang of Zoroaster, Vendidad XV, 14, what must have been its virtue may be gathered from legends of Gustap [Vistaspa] and Ardu Viraf, who are said to have been transported in soul to heavens, and to have had the higher mysteries revealed to them, on drinking from a cup prepared by the prophet – Sardust namah – (or from a cup of Gustap-bang) that she might think according to the law, speak according to the law, and do according to the law. “For her brightness and glory, I will offer unto her a sacrifice worth being heard…” (Darmesteter, 1883). n the Zoroastrian tale “…the Artak Viraz Namak … Hell, Purgatory, Iand Heaven, the rewards bestowed on the good, and the punishment awaiting the sinner are here described in a vision induced by hashish” (Campbell, 2000). As Herbert Gowen explained in A History of Religion, some centuries after the time of Zoroaster, when the people had grown skeptical and began to lose faith it was decided by the “dasturs (an order of priests) to send one of their number, through the use of hashish, to the other world, that he may report on his return as to the realities of future reward and retribution. Ara Viraf, chosen by lot, makes the journey…” (Gowen, 1934).

The Book of Arda Wiraz is generally thought to have originated sometime around the 3rd century A.D., but existing copies are believed to have not been written down until around the 9th century, and it underwent many redactions before it came into its final form some time after the advent of Islam. If we take into account that the accepted date for the life of Zoroaster is around 600B.C. ., or earlier, this later account attests to the ongoing use of bhanga/mang for shamanic purposes for a millennium, despite the existing prohibitions on its use in the wider and more public Haoma ceremonies. In the Book of Arda Viraf, which describes the dream-journey of a devout Zoroastrian through the next world is bhanga (narcotic) mentioned in Part 1., Chapter 2, 24: ‘‘And then those Dasturs of the religion filled three golden cups with wine and narcotic of Vishtasp.’’ Similarly, the ancient Aryans that settled in India used Cannabis, but in their worship of the deity Shiva. In one of the Tantric Scriptures we find this revealing statement: ‘‘Intoxicating drink (containing bhang) is consumed in order to liberate oneself, and that those who do so, in dominating their mental faculties and following the law of Shiva (yoga) – are to be likened to immortals on earth.’ [The Mahanirvana Tantra (XI,105–108)] (Hanu , 2008). The Book of Arda Wiraz Namag takes place in a period where the Zoroastrian religion was in a state of confusion and people were in doubt of the faith. In reaction to this the religious leaders gathered together in order to find a solution and the decision was that they needed to seek word from the spiritual realm, using the time-tested technique of ingestion of mang. The Priests gathered together 7 of the most righteous men in the community, and then through a picking of lots, Arda Wiraz was selected. After enjoying a luxurious last meal and saying goodbye to his 7 wives, the Book of Arda Wiraz continues with the account: And this Viraz washed (his) head and (his) body, and put on a new garment; perfumed (himself) with an agreeable perfume, spread a new, clean blanket on some appropriate boards. At a (given) moment (he) sat down on the clean blanket, and performed the (rite of sacrifice), and remembered (the departed) souls, and ate food. And afterwards the theologians of the Religion filled three golden cups with wine and with the Vishtaspian narcotic [mang], and they gave one cup over to Viraz (in conformity) with the “good thought,” and the second cup (in conformity) with the “good speech,” and the third cup (in conformity) with the", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634243995_cleaned.txt:214:d96e02ea70f3", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 2164, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634243995_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634243995", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634243995_cleaned", "chunk_index": 215, "text": "on some appropriate boards.

Arda Viraf drinks “three gold cups with wine and “vistaspic hemp” (in other words hemp extract) … has some time to thank consciousness, and then falls asleep on the gown. He sleeps for seven days and nights, and during this time his soul visits heaven and hell” (Nyberg, 1938). After partaking of an extremely strong psychedelic dose of mang Ardu Viraf lay in what appeared to outsiders as a deathlike coma and had a classic out-of-body-experience, in which the ancient psychonaut believed he traveled on the mythical Cinvat bridge to Heaven where he witnessed: “All dwell among fine carpets and cushions in great pleasure and joy….Viraf, after returning to the bridge, was then taken to hell that he might see the lot of the wicked…He saw the ‘greedy jaws of hell, like the most frightful pit.’ Everyone in hell is packed in so tight that life is intolerable, yet all believe that they are alone…” (Hinnels, 1973). Referring to Ardu Viraf ’s hemp inspired heavenly voyage, Mircea Eliade wrote, “…we must take … into consideration the symbolic value of narcotic intoxication. It was equivalent to a ‘death’, the intoxicated person left his body, acquired the conditions of ghosts and spirits, mystical ecstasy being assimilated to a temporary ‘death’ or leaving the body, all intoxicants that produced the same were given a place amongst the techniques of ecstasy” (Eliade 1964). “The most explicit detailed Iranian account of intoxication for religious purposes is the Arda Wiraz Namag … [it] demonstrates the belief that pharmacologically induced visions were the means to religious knowledge and that they were at the basis of the religion that the Magi claimed to have received from Zoroaster” (Flattery & Schwartz 1989). As noted earlier, Widengren (1965), Hellholm, et al. (1989), Dobroruka (2006) have all suggested that references to the use of bhanga/mang may have been suppressed in the later Sasanian period when many of the accounts first made the transition from oral traditions to the written traditions which have survived. Notably, as Widengren mentions, “The term for ‘hemp’, bangha, is used in the Avesta, however it is missing in the Gathas” (Widengren, 1965).

The Gathas, being the book directly attributed to the authorship of Zoroaster, which is also silent on the topic of Haoma. If we go in contrast to the late-Zoroastrian Vendidad, hemp is demonized here. From 15 it emerges, that it was used as an abortifacient agent, and in 19 it is linked with the demon Kunda. In 19 it is emphatically stated by Ahura Mazdah that it is “axafna abanha,” which means “without trance and without hemp.” …If a man in the ancient congregations could now be called Pouru.banha [“possessing much hemp”] just like that and his “fravasi” remained nevertheless an object of worship, then without a doubt it can be perceived, in the opinion of the Vendidad, that there is a conscious polemic against the elder rites of the congregation. At this later stage, the old ecstasy was considered as a demonic nuisance; the metamorphosis of the old trance-goddess Busyasta in to the demon of somnolence goes in parallel with the denunciation of hemp, while in contrast Chwafna, originally the trance, is worshiped further, without a doubt with altered significance (Nyberg, 1938). The demonization of a Goddess associated with cannabis, is interesting in regards to what we saw with Asherah. In relation to this demonization, Nyberg noted that a “very interesting list of demons exists … it includes the following female demons: Budhi with the parallel form Budhiza, Kundi with the parallel form Kundiza and finally the old goddess of ecstasy Busyansta, ‘things to come,’ the demon of somnolence in Zoroastrianism” (Nyberg, 1938). Apparently these deities were important figures in the early use of cannabis, and may give us some insights into the more ancient pre-Zoroastrian cultic use of cannabis amongst the Aryans: In Budhiza, true Budhiza, and Kundiza, true Kundiza, one can again recognize the word “iza,” which serves as a synonym for Armaiti, the godly tribe, in oldest Zoroastrianism; Budhiza therefore actually means “tribe and cult congregation of the goddess Budhi” and Kundiza “tribe and cult congregation of the goddess Kundi”… Alongside the goddess Kundi there is also a masculine Kunda, who needless to say is now a demon. Vend. 19,41 deals with him as follows “the Sraosa accompanied by Asi would like to slay the demon Kunda, the one with the hemp, so that he no longer has hemp.” Kunda and indeed also Kundi were therefore very closely linked with the old ecstatic substance of hemp, which was used since ancient times by the Aryans in the North and East. Kundiza was a body or guild", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634243995_cleaned.txt:216:a33b7fe856e5", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 2166, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634243995_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634243995", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634243995_cleaned", "chunk_index": 217, "text": "also a masculine Kunda, who needless to say is now a demon.

Kundiza was a body or guild of ecstatics, who reached the ecstatic state through narcotization with hemp. If, as I believe, the Median town Kunduru, mentioned in the Behistun Inscription and written Kuntarrus = Kundaru in the Elamite version, is linked with this pair of gods, then it must have been an old West Iranian hashish nest… The goddess Busyansta is probably regarded as the common oracle deity of the West, which views oracle as a divine strength. As she represents the demon of somnolence, then we must assume that she began to function in trance. She [the goddess Busyansta] receives the epithet “zairina,” that in my opinion should not be translated as “exhausting, flagging” rather “golden”; that is an epithet in the same style as Zairica. It alludes presumably to the ingested ecstasy potion. Maybe it was hemp extract in wine… (Nyberg, 1938). If there were a polemic against hemp, as these passages indicate, it would explain a lot about the confusion on the matter. As for the contradictions surrounding the figure of Zoroaster this raises, I have proposed one possibility regarding the prohibitions of Haoma and the use of mang, indicating that it was the use by the wider public against which Zoroaster rallied, and this could also be clearly applied to the use of cannabis as well, which would also explain any movement to suppress the use of cannabis such as those noted by Nyberg above. However, there is the very real possibility that the term “Zoroaster” itself, may be less of a personal name and more of a title, which was applied to different individuals with different views on the ingestion of mang and Haoma, with some ‘Zoroasters’ approving of its use, and others condemning it. Around the most popular estimated date for the time of Zoroaster, 600 BCE, Cyrus the Great was born, and through this king, Perempire that expanded under his rule included most of Southwest Asia and much of Central Asia, from Egypt and the Hellespont in the west to the Indus River in the east, to create the largest state the world had yet seen. Cyrus died in battle, fighting the Scythians along the Syr Darya in 530 BCE. Beyond his nation, Cyrus left a lasting legacy on Jewish religion (through his Edict of Restoration), and as a result on the Hebrew Bible.

The prophet Isaiah referred to Cyrus the Great of Persia as “the anointed of Yahweh,” whom Yahweh himself led, “to subdue nations before him that gates may not be closed.” Yet historically, Cyrus, referred to in the Hebrew Bible as “the King of Kings,” (the same title applied to Jesus Christ in the New Testament) and who returned the different peoples that he had conquered to their homelands and restored each of their gods to their temples, continued to worship the pre-Zoroastrian gods of his own ancestors. The Bible records that a remnant of the Jewish population returned to the Promised Land from Babylon, following an edict (reproduced in the Book of Ezra) from Cyrus to rebuild the temple. As a result of Cyrus’ policies, the Jews honored him as a dignified and righteous king. He is the only Gentile to be designated as a messiah, a divinely-appointed king, in the Hebrew Bible (Isaiah 45:1-6). However, at the time, there was also Jewish criticism of him after he was lied to by the Cuthites, who wanted to halt the building of the Second Temple. They accused the Jews of conspiring to rebel, so Cyrus in turn stopped the construction of the temple, which would not be completed until 516 BC, during the reign of Darius the Great. Darius was Cyrus’ son in law, and he was able to take the throne by marriage, as both of Cyrus’ own sons had died in battle. Important to our study, according to Zoroastrian tradition, Darius’ blood father was Hystaspes, the Greek version of the name Vishtaspa – the aforementioned king who converted to Zoroaster’s religion after drinking mang! 11 The name Hystaspes can be found in the inscriptions at Persepolis and Behistun Inscription, where the full lineage of Darius the Great was given: King Darius says: My father is Hystaspes [Vištâspa]; the father of Hystaspes was Arsames [Aršâma]; the father of Arsames was Ariaramnes [Ariyâramna]; the father of Ariaramnes was Teispes [Cišpiš]; the father of Teispes was Achaemenes [Haxâmaniš]. King Darius says: That is why we are called Achaemenids; from antiquity we have been noble; from antiquity has our dynasty been royal. King Darius says: Eight of my dynasty were kings before me; I am the ninth. Nine in succession we have been kings. If, we accept that by the name “Hystaspes” (i.e. Vištâspa), the Avestan texts do refer to the father of Darius I, then according to Zoroastrian scripture, Zarathustra lived during the 6th Century BCE.

If, we accept that by the name “Hystaspes” (i.e. Vištâspa), the Avestan texts do refer to the father of Darius I, then according to Zoroastrian scripture, Zarathustra lived during the 6th Century BCE. Other Zoroastrian sources corroborate this. The Bundahishn, a scripture written down around the time of the Islamic conquest of Persia (CE 637), places the birth of Zoroaster at 588 BCE. It has also been noted that Cyrus and Cambyses adhered to the Mazdean pantheistic beliefs of their ancestors, leaving no mention of Zarathustra in their inscriptions, while on the other hand it is clear that Darius and his successors were monotheistic Zoroastrian followers of Ahura Mazda. In addition, the very nature of the Zoroastrian reformation, a transformation of an ancient religion from pantheism to monotheism, may be seen as supportive of a 6th Century BCE dating, because such a dating corresponds with the cohabitation of Persia by significant numbers of a monotheistic people – the exiled Jews. Zoroastrian monotheism was made the state religion throughout the Persian empire, with its one hundred and twenty-seven provinces, by Darius Hystaspis, whose reign extended from India to Ethiopia, B.C. 521.… And this, too, was true of her many provinces until they were wrestled from her by superior force. (Brown, 1890) Among the situations where sauma [haoma] seems most likely to have been used was at the inauguration of pre-Islamic Iranian rulers. This is indicated by King Wishtasp’s consumption of “hom and mang” at his “initiation,” which is still commemorated by Zoroastrians at the New Year..… A reflection of the initiation of kings with sauma may be preserved in Plutarch’s Life of Artaxerxes III. 1-3: “A little while after the death of Darius [II], the new king made an expedition to Pasargadae that he might receive the royal initiation at the hands of the Persian priests. Here there is a sanctuary to a warlike goddess whom one might conjecture to be Athena. Into this sanctuary the candidate for initiation must pass, and after laying aside his own proper robe must put on that which Cyrus the Elder used to wear before he became king; then he must eat a cake of figs,12 chew some turpentine-wood, and drink a cup of sour milk. Whatever else is done besides this is unknown to outsiders.” Zoroaster also put on a garment when he came up from the hom liquid as, it seems, did his father Porushasp when he approached the hom and as also did Arda Wiraz. This suggests that a change of clothes may have been a regular feature of sauma-drinking in the initiation of Iranian rulers", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634243995_cleaned.txt:219:6fccd704869e", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 2169, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634243995_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634243995", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634243995_cleaned", "chunk_index": 220, "text": "he must eat a cake of figs,12 chew some turpentine-wood, and drink a cup of sour milk.

This suggests that a change of clothes may have been a regular feature of sauma-drinking in the initiation of Iranian rulers (Bedrosian, 2006). These accounts are consistent with stone inscriptions found in Fars from about 300CE , by Kirdir, the founder of the Sasanian Zoroastrian ecclesiastical establishment. “Kirdir’s inscription asserts in this passage, as a basis of his claim to religious authority, that his spiritdouble visited the other world and was shown heaven and hell. The account thus parallels the Arda Wiraz Namag in reaffirming the reliance placed on a vision of menog existence as the means to religious truth” (Flattery & Schwartz 1989). As Shaul Shaked noted in Quests and Visionary Journeys in Sasanian Iran: [] Sasanian Bowl, depicting the ruler, possibly drinking the Cup of Haoma or wine, mixed with mang. Note the grape vine on the right, but on the left a smaller bush-like plant is depicted, items in the picture could be conceivably identified as implements for mixing and straining (Image British Museum). Visions as done by Kider and Arda Wiraz, was one way of communicating with the gods and obtaining direct knowledge of the things of the next world, a way of verifying the truths of the religion.… [The devotee] would be transported to the other world; when he came back his arrival would be celebrated with a great show of joy and relief. Several of these elements show strong similarity with the complex of practices associated with shamanic cults. Such cults are nowadays typical of the fringes of the Iranian world, [i.e. the continued use of dūḡ-e waḥdat] and it makes sense to assume that they formed part of the Iranian civilization itself… It is striking that Pahlavi literature of the late Sasanian and early Islamic period is practically obsessed with descriptions of the hereafter and of entities that belong to the invisible world. The classic example is the Book of Arda Wiraz, but it is not unique … visions … are alluded to quite frequently in the Pahlavi books, together with the discussion of the possibility of the seeing of menog, the invisible world, by the organ dedicated to this kind of vision, “the eye of the soul.” n relation to this discussion of haoma and bhanga, it is worth noting I that in an article reproduced in The Book of Grass: An Anthology on Indian Hemp (1967) Melvin Clay referred to recipes for a “suama” plant found around Tell Abu Matar in Israel, appearing on urns and cups, of high quality workmanship, which", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634243995_cleaned.txt:220:a1da76e367ed", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 2170, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634243995_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634243995", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634243995_cleaned", "chunk_index": 221, "text": "the possibility of the seeing of menog, the invisible world, by the organ dedicated to this kind of vision, “the eye of the soul.” n relation to this discussion of haoma and bhanga, it is worth noting I that in an article reproduced in The Book of Grass: An Anthology on Indian Hemp (1967) Melvin Clay referred to recipes for a “suama” plant found around Tell Abu Matar in Israel, appearing on urns and cups, of high quality workmanship, which was partially reproduced in The Book of Grass (1967). Clay wrote that the recipes, which he placed around the third century B.C.E., originated with a hermit named Zin, who had been banned from the Second Temple in Jerusalem. This may indicate that he was practicing a form of Persian worship. Apparently, as cannabis had been, the suama plant was used at religious feasts, the roots boiled and drunk or the leaves smoked. Clay wrote that the suama plant was originally found in the region of Kadesh-barnea, northeastern Sinai. An area near where Moses was said to have first heard the “Word of the Lord” in a fiery bush. As with other cosmological elements, for well over a century, it has been suggested that this same form of entheogenic induction, had been utilized by a Hebrew vassal of the Persian Empire, Ezra, who had been sent back to his homeland with a decree from Darius, son of the aforementioned Vistashpa, to build the Second Temple. The Second Temple was dedicated in 516 BCE, and the reintroes. The most prominent change, was the powers instilled in the new priestly caste who governed the worship, as the Levites, who had gone “astray … after idols … and made the house of Israel fall into sin” (Ezekiel 44:11-12), were no longer permitted to perform services in the inner temple. Those Levites who repented were limited to the role of the priest’s servants. Ezra, a scribe and priest who was an expert on Jewish law, played a pivotal role in the “reformation” after the Exile and he has been seen as a “Second Moses” for this. In the Hebrew Bible Ezra is described as a descendant of Sraya, the last High Priest to serve in the First Temple and he was said to have represented a faction of Jews in Babylon, who adhered to the “reforms” of Josiah. Concerned about the lack of implementation of these Laws in their native Judaea, they decided to form a posse and remedy the situation and return to their homeland. However, in this regard, it should be noted that Ezra was also acting as a commissioner of the Persian government and his title, “scribe of the law of the God of heaven,” can be seen as a position as an intermediary with the Persian rulers, and a role more akin to “royal secretary for Jewish religious affairs.” The Persian", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634243995_cleaned.txt:221:dd0d4a08c20b", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 2171, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634243995_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634243995", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634243995_cleaned", "chunk_index": 222, "text": "these Laws in their native Judaea, they decided to form a posse and remedy the situation and return to their homeland.

Thus they insisted that these be regulated under a responsible authority that was loyal to them. The book of Malachi is contemporary to that of Ezra, and some attributed it to Ezra himself. Malachi 2:11 has been interpreted as indicating that it did not take long after the “reforms” of Josiah, for Judah to return to the polytheistic practices of their ancestors, and the worship of the Mother Goddess Asherah: “Judah hath dealt treacherously, and an abomination is committed in Israel and in Jerusalem; for Judah hath profaned the holiness of the LORD which he loved, and hath married the daughter of a strange god” (Malachi 2:11). The Levites were wound up with this as well, as they had gone “astray … after idols … and made the house of Israel fall into sin” (Ezekiel 44:11-12). Ezra as well, made reference to the Levites partaking in “detestable practices, like those of the Canaanites, Hittites, Perizzites, Jebusites, Ammonites, Moabites, Egyptians and Amorites” (Ezra 9:1) and taking foreign wives, as did other Hebrews. This, combined with archaeological evidence from the period, indicates the people living in Judah were still practicing the longstanding polytheistic religion of their ancestors, despite the pre-Exilic attempts at instilling monotheism described in the Hebrew Bible. Ezra, is described as convincing many of them to give up these “adulterous” practices, as well as their foreign wives (Ezra 10:2-5). A contemporary of Ezra and fellow leader in establishing the new community, Nehemiah also refers to having had to purify the “Levites of everything foreign” (Nehemiah 13:30). And not just the Levites, in the short amount of time of the Exile, the people left in Judah had already drifted away from the attempted reforms of Josiah, if they were ever even successfully instituted, and returned to the polytheistic religion of their ancestors. Ezra had to teach the people monotheistic Judaism. When Ezra preached from the texts of what would become The Hebrew Bible, they were new and foreign to the ears of the people in Judah. Some see that it is only here, after the Exile, that the monotheistic Judaism we know today, became established as anything close to its present form, and this came with a strong influence from their Zoroastrian Persian overlords.

Zoroastrian-Canaanites?The idea that Jewish monotheism finds its origins in the Persian chael D. Magee.1 Magee gives a detailed explanation of how Judaism was created by the Persians in 500 BCE. “Historical Israel, the actual flesh and blood people who dwelt in the central mountains during the Iron Ages, didn’t come from Egypt. They were descendants of earlier, Bronze Age inhabitants of the places where they lived. Their culture and religion was a slightly evolved form of the earlier, Bronze Age Canaanite ones” (Magee, 1998; 2008). …Israel and Judah remained Canaanite until the Persians came at the end of the sixth century BC. Only in the following century were books about Jewish history written down…. Some events of the Bible are confirmed by external investigation. Some of the kings of Israel and Judah appear in Assyrian records and therefore can be dated. However, given that the history of Israel was only first written in the Persian period, and the Persians had conquered Assyria and Babylonia, and had access to their archives covering hundreds of years, it is more than likely that the scriptural stories of the monarchical period were simply written from the official king lists, inscriptions and diplomatic correspondence of those formerly mighty powers. In short, it is largely historical fiction but set in a realistic historical framework (Magee, 1998; 2008). The Jewish scriptures make up a constitution for the Jewish people to whom they were given. The earliest time that rules like reading the Torah publicly and observing its charges faithfully, abstention from work and commerce on the sabbath, avoiding intermarriage, tithing, maintaining temple sacrifice through a self-imposed tax (Neh 10:30-40) could appear is when Ezra and Nehemiah were sent by the Persian king during the fifth century BC to determine civil and religious policy in Yehud [Israel] (Magee, 1998; 2008). Magee puts forth that part of the Persian policy of restoration of people back to their homelands, included having the main male deity from each existing pantheon elevated to the same state as that of their own monotheist god Ahura Mazda, at the sacrifice of the powers of the gods and goddesses of the earlier pantheons. In each place that such a god was placed upon this lone throne, he took with him the title, “king of heaven.” As Magee explains it, for reasons of political consolidation the rulers wanted the people to worship one sole god, the concept being that everyone would worship a “king of heaven” with", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634243995_cleaned.txt:223:4cec73259c29", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 2173, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634243995_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634243995", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634243995_cleaned", "chunk_index": 224, "text": "the same state as that of their own monotheist god Ahura Mazda, at the sacrifice of the powers of the gods and goddesses of the earlier pantheons.

The ancestor of the Jews is from Mesopotamia, so, in the myth of Abraham, the Jews are shown to have an ethnic affinity with that region. The anachronism of calling it the Chaldees betrays its late composition. Immediately, the descendants of Abraham are enslaved by the Egyptians and have to undergo countless tribulations before they escape and set up in Israel. The propaganda purpose is plain – to dissociate the inhabitants of the Palestinian hill country from Egypt and paint the Egyptians as their enemies (Magee, 1998; 2008). The Chaldaean language was the language of Babylonia (Ezra 5:12) at the time of the project of Ezra to set up a new religion in Jerusalem. Why then would Moses, a Hebrew brought up in Egypt under some Pharaoh like Rameses, write in a language of a distant country 800 years later? Philo, an Egyptian Jew, effectively admits the Torah was written by Ezra, a Persian from Babylonia. Israelite religion must therefore have been a variant of the religions practiced by Canaanites in general.

There was no particular slow variation from other Canaanite religions, but there was a sudden imposition of a foreign cult on to the local religion of Jerusalem. The imposition was resisted by locals for many decades but ultimately it triumphed, albeit in a highly fragmentated state (Magee, 1998; 2008). Zoroastrianism is the oldest of the revealed creedal religions, and it has probably had more influence on mankind, directly and indirectly, than any other single faith. In its own right it was the state religion of three great Iranian empires … Iran’s power and wealth lent it immense prestige, and some of its leading doctrines were adopted by Judaism… (Boyce, 1983) A large portion of this Zoroastrian influence likely came into Israel with the post-Exile prophet, Ezra. Ezra was born in Babylon, and was among the Jews returned during the reign of Darius, who as noted was the son of the psychonaut Zoroastrian king Vishtaspa. Ezra had worked as a scribe in the Persian world before being returned to his homeland and he was a key figure of the Jewish monotheistic reformation after the Persians had returned the Jews to their homeland after close to a century of exile. 2 Esdras 14, is an apocalyptic book in some English versions of the Bible, scholarship places its composition between 70 and 218 CE, but tradition ascribes it to Ezra himself in the fifth century BCE. In it, Ezra is described as first hearing the word of god, as Moses was said to have done centuries before him, from within a bush, and then he is given further instructions after consuming a “cup of fire” which scholars have suggested was a infusion identical with the Zoroastrian beverages we discussed in the previous chapter. As 2 Esdras describes: ses when my people were in bondage in Egypt, and I sent him and led my people out of Egypt, and I led him up on Mount Sinai, where I kept him with me many days. I told him many wondrous things and showed him the secrets of the times and declared to him the end of the times. Then I commanded him, saying, ‘These words you shall publish openly, and these you shall keep secret.’ And now I say to you: “Lay up in your heart the signs that I have shown you, the dreams that you have seen, and the interpretations that you have heard…” Then I answered and said, “Let me speak in your presence, Lord.", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634243995_cleaned.txt:225:f77a5cdb201f", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 2175, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634243995_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634243995", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634243995_cleaned", "chunk_index": 226, "text": "many wondrous things and showed him the secrets of the times and declared to him the end of the times.

But prepare for yourself many writing tablets, and take with you Sarea, Dabria, Selemia, Ethanus, and Asiel – these five, who are trained to write rapidly, and you shall come here, and I will light in your heart the lamp of understanding, which shall not be put out until what you are about to write is finished. And when you have finished, some things you shall make public, and some you shall deliver in secret to the wise; tomorrow at this hour you shall begin to write.” Then I went as he commanded me, and I gathered all the people together and said, “Hear these words, O Israel. At first our ancestors lived as aliens in Egypt, and they were liberated from there and received the law of life, which they did not keep, which you also have transgressed after them. Then land was given to you for a possession in the land of Zion, but you and your ancestors committed iniquity and did not keep the ways that the Most High commanded you.

But let no one come to me now, and let no one seek me for forty days.” So I took the five men, as he had commanded me, and we proceeded to the field and remained there. And on the next day a voice called me, saying, “Ezra, open your mouth and drink what I give you to drink.” So I opened my mouth, and a full cup was offered to me; it was full of something like water, but its color was like fire. I took it and drank, and when I had drunk it, my heart poured forth understanding, and wisdom increased in my breast, for my spirit retained its memory, and my mouth was opened and was no longer closed. Moreover, the Most High gave understanding to the five men, and by turns they wrote what was dictated, using characters that they did not know. They sat forty days; they wrote during the daytime and ate their bread at night. But as for me, I spoke in the daytime and was not silent at night. So during the forty days, ninety-four books were written. And when the forty days were ended, the Most High spoke to me, saying, “Make public the twenty-four books that you wrote first, and let the worthy and the unworthy read them, but keep the seventy that were written last, in order to give them to the wise among your people. For in them is the spring of understanding, the fountain of wisdom, and the river of knowledge.” And I did so (2 Esdras 14). Interestingly here in this passage, like Moses before him, he first hears the lord from within a bush, and like Zoroaster before him, along with other Zoroastrian figures, God’s wisdom comes through a drink.

The noted 19th century journalist and foe of slavery, George Washington Brown, provided some interesting insights into this “cup of fire” that inspired Ezra in his Researches in oriental history: Embracing the origin of the Jews, the rise and development of Zoroastrianism, and the derivation of Christianity (1890), which is quoted at length here: It was B.C.634 years, Bible chronology, that “Josiah began to manifest great zeal towards the pure worship of God.” Only 47 years thereafter to wit; B.C. 587, the walls of Jerusalem were broken down by the armies of Nebuchadnezzar, the temple was burned, and the people were led, with hooks in their noses, to Babylon. Seventy years went by, the temple was rebuilt, and some 42,000 persons, according to Ezra “came again into Jerusalem and Judah, everyone to his own city.” Another long period passed. “Ezra went up from Babylon,” Ezra 7:6. He was a ready scribe, and Josephus says he was a high priest. This event occurred B.C. 447, 130 years after the destruction of the temple. He took a large party with him, was four months on the way, and bore letters from Artaxerxes, virtually making him governor of Judaea. A year later, to wit; 446 B.C. Nehemiah was sent to “Judah to build it.” …In Nehemiah, 8:5, we read, “Ezra opened the book in the sight of all the people;” verse 9, “All the people wept, when they heard the words of the law;” and verse 18, “Day by day, from the first day unto the last,” for seven days, “he read from the book of the law.” Where did Ezra get “the book of the law?” “Ezra appears to have made the sacred scriptures during the captivity his special study. And perhaps assisted by Nehemiah and the great synagogue, he corrected the errors that had crept into the Sacred Writings, through negligence or mistakes of transcribers; he collected all the books of which the Sacred Scriptures then consisted, disposed them in their proper order, and settled the canon scripture for his time. He occasionally added, under the superintendence of the Holy Spirit, whatever appeared necessary for the purpose of illustrating, completing, or correcting them.… Though not styled a prophet, he wrote under the Divine Spirit; and the canonical authority of his book has never been disputed.” … We find the Book of the Law in Ezra’s possession about 150 years after the beginning of the Jewish captivity, and we find him for seven days reading from the holy book while the people listened and wept.

The temple at Jerusalem was burned, and the natural presumption is, the Jewish library was burned with it. Where did Ezra get the book of the Law from which he read? Nehemiah does not tell. The book of Ezra is silent. “Behold Lord … The world is set in darkness, and they that dwell therein are without light, for thy law is burnt, therefore no man knoweth the things that are done of thee, or the works that shall begin; but I have found grace before thee, send the Holy Ghost into me and I shall write all that hath been done in the world since the beginning, which were written in thy law, that men may find thy path, and that they which live in the latter days may live.” From the time the temple was burned, with the sacred books of the Jews, and the people were taken captives to Babylon, B.C. 587, to this period when Ezra was about to “set forth a correct edition of the Scriptures” between 444 and 433 B.C., about 150 years had intervened, during all of which period there had been no Sacred Scriptures, no Inspired Word of God, no books of the Jewish Law, no national library, because they were burned with the temple. How could Ezra repeat from memory, as Kitto suggests, this voluminous record, which had no existence in his day, or the several generations before him? Zoroastrian monotheism was made the state religion throughout the Persian empire, with its one hundred and twenty-seven provinces, by Darius Hystaspis, [son of Vishataspa] whose reign extended from India to Ethiopia, B.C. 521. That continued the established religion throughout Persia until it was partially succeeded by the monotheism of Mohamet. And this, too, was true of her many provinces until they were wrestled from her by superior force. It was the law of Judea by virtue of Persian authority, when Ezra decided to write the history of the world from the beginning – shall we say, copied the holy books from Assur-bani-pal’s Library, duplicates of some of them, with the story of creation, the fall of man, the general deluge, the tower of Babel, and the confusion of language are now on file in the British Museum, written on earthen plates, in cuneiform characters … under the direction of a Babylonian priest… But this quotation from Esdras, as regards the burning of the law with the temple, and Ezra’s declared purpose to write a history of the world from the", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634243995_cleaned.txt:229:1aae3ccf55bf", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 2179, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634243995_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634243995", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634243995_cleaned", "chunk_index": 230, "text": "from Assur-bani-pal’s Library, duplicates of some of them, with the story of creation, the fall of man, the general deluge, the tower of Babel, and the confusion of language are now on file in the British Museum, written on earthen plates, in cuneiform characters … under the direction of a Babylonian priest… But this quotation from Esdras, as regards the burning of the law with the temple, and Ezra’s declared purpose to write a history of the world from the beginning, with a quotation to follow, are from one of the apocryphal books, not recognized as canonical by the Protestants. What are the facts? The apocryphal books were placed on an equality with the residue of the inspired Scriptures by the Council of Trent, in 1545; therefore they are portions of the infallible “Word of God” with Catholics; but as this action of a general council occurred after the Reformation under Luther, its action is not binding on Protestants; though the Church of England allows the books to be read for “edification and instruction,” and they are as genuine as any other portion of the holy writ, and of equal authority with the best; but in the honesty and simplicity of the author, Ezra – Esdras, the Latin form of the name – he unwittingly told how the sacred books were made, and under what influence. This has prejudiced their standing. Again, in the Library of Universal Knowledge, we are told that the title, apocryphal, was “sometimes given to writings whose public use was not thought advisable;” that is to say, “God did not exercise good judgment when he inspired his prophets to write, therefore we, the priests, must suppress portions of his Word!” We apprehend in the case of 1st and 2nd Esdras this was the real reason for not making the apocryphal books canonical at the Council of Laodicia, A.D. 360, when the other books were declared the “Word of God.” “The next day, behold a voice cried to me saying. ‘Esdras open thy mouth, and drink what I give you thee to drink!’ Then opened I my mouth, and behold, he reached me a full cup, which is full as it were with water, but the color of it was like fire. I took it, and drank: and when I had drunk of it, my heart uttered understanding, and wisdom grew in my breast, for my spirit strengthened and my memory; and my mouth was opened and shut no more: and they sat forty days, and they wrote in the day, and at night they ate bread.

A voice bid him open his mouth, he – the voice, of course – reached Esdras a full cup. It would be interesting to know whose voice it was which possessed such unnatural powers; yet we apprehend the reader is much more anxious to know the contents of the cup, which was fiery red, and which possessed such wondrous ability, probably the same possessed by the “fruit of the tree” which grew “in the midst of the garden,” the eating of which opened the eyes of our first parents, and enabled them to see “as Gods knowing good and evil.” We think we can furnish this desired information, to do which we are compelled to anticipate some facts existing among Zoroastrian worshipers; many centuries before the date religionists ascribe to Abraham, and which was practiced in Persia, Assyria and Babylonia at the very time Ezra was writing Jewish history under the influence of the “fiery cup.” Among other duties required on occasional sacrifices of animals to Ahura-Mazda, additional to prayers, praises, thanksgiving, and the recitation of hymns, was the performance from time to time of a curious ceremony known as that of the Haoma or Homa. This consisted of the extraction of the juice of the Homa plant by the priests during the recitation of prayers, the formal presentation of the liquid extracted to the sacrificial fire … the consumption of a small portion of it by one of the officiating ministers, and the division of the remainder among the worshipers… “The whole Sama-Veda is devoted to this moon-plant worship; an important part of the Avesta is occupied by Hymns to Homa. This great reverence paid to the plant, on account of its intoxicating qualities, carries us back to a region where the vine was unknown, and to a race to whom intoxication was so new an experience as to seem a gift of the gods. Wisdom appeared to come from it, health, increased power of body and soul, long life, victory in battle, brilliant children. What Bacchus was to the Greeks, the Divine Haoma, or Soma, was to the primitive Aryans.” What was the Haoma or Homa, the production of the moon-plant, growing in those regions of Asia to far north for the successful growing of the grape, and yet yielding such intoxicating properties?

It is now known in India as bhang, and is popularly known with us as hashish, the stimulating and intoxicating effects of which are well known to physicians. The extract from its young and tender top has a fragrant odor, and a warm bitterish and acrid taste. The adoration paid to the prepared juice of this plant, and its use on sacrificial occasions, and the drinking of it by the high priest Ezra, as he was about to “open his mouth,” while the “five swift scribes” wrote down his words when he was filled with wisdom and understanding, and was about to dictate history “from the beginning of the world,” can best be appreciated by members of the medical profession who have personally experienced its exhilarating effects on some fellow student, who was elevated by his own estimation, on a high pedestal and was capable of taking in all that has been, is, and may be in the material universe. Indeed, an acquaintance with this fact explains all those graphic descriptions in that celebrated history of the creation of the world; of the making of man – and of woman in particular; their expulsion from the garden – not forgetting that interesting interview with the snake, the materialized form of Angro-Mainyus, or in our vernacular, the Devil; the account of the deluge; Noah’s drunken debauchery; Lot’s wife changed into a pillar of salt; and the widower’s escapade with his daughters; Jacob wrestling with God, getting a broken thigh and seeing angels ascending and descending a ladder to and from heaven; the terrible plagues on Egypt; the parting of the Red Sea; the law passed down through a cloud to Moses by God himself; the adventures of Samson with the foxes, his contest with the lion, and the loss of his hair; David with his sling; the Hebrew boys in the fiery furnace; not omitting Jonah’s wonderful gourd, nor his fishing exploits; Elijah’s ride to heaven; and Elisha’s children eating bears. No criticisms are required when it is known what kind of drink Ezra was regaled with before “opening his mouth” to dictate history for his swift scribes to write. But reader, there is still another fact we may as well state with this connection.

The wine in the sacrament of the “Lord’s Supper” is a survival of the adoration and use, with prayers and hymns, of this divine Haoma, a substitution of a more pleasant intoxicant [wine] by the later worshipers of Mithra, who, in after years are known as Christians. This is a faithful history of the making of the Bible, as detailed by the author himself. He informs us, 2 Edras 14.44 to 46, that of the 204 books thus written he was instructed by the Highest to publish the first openly, “that the worthy and unworthy may read it; but keep the 70 last that thou mayest deliver them only to such as be wise among the people: for in them is the spring of understanding, the fountain of wisdom, and the stream of knowledge.” In the account of Ezra drinking from the cup of fire, one is clearly reminded of the tradition of the Zoroastrian accounts of the drinking of mang mixed with Haoma or wine. “The image of a blazing cup was apparently related to … Zoroastrism; Zoroastrian texts mention ritual vessels with fire burning inside them” (Kisel, 2007). …4Ezra 14:38-42 - “And on the next day, behold, a voice called me, saying, ‘Ezra, open your mouth and drink what I give you to drink’. Then I opened my mouth, and behold, a full cup was offered to me; it was full of something like water, but it’s color was like fire. And I took it and drank […].” Similar drinks appear in Persian literature, e.g. Bhaman Yasht 3:7-8, when Zoroaster “drinks” the water he acquires the wisdom of Ahura Mazda. Similarly, Vishtaspa has an experience quite equivalent in the Dinkard 7:4.84-86 where mention is made to a mixture of wine (or haoma) and hemp with henbane … opposition to those practices may have generated their replacement in the later BY [Bahman Yast]. The Book of Artay Viraz also mentions visions obtained from wine mixed with hemp, and for the preparations of the seer cf. ch. 2.25-28 (Dobroruka, 2002). Dobroruka revisited this theme in more detail in his later 2006 article, “Chemically-induced visions in the Fourth Book of Ezra in light of comparative Persian material,” and again draws direct comparisons between Ezra’s cup of fire, and the mang-mixed infused beverages of the Zoroastrian psychonauts. Dobroruka expanded on this connection by noting the similar accounts of the flowers eaten by Ezra in 4 Ezra 9, and those used for similar revelation by the Zoroastrian figure Jamasp: But if you will let seven days more pass – do not fast during them, however; but go", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634243995_cleaned.txt:233:946621dbaa43", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 2183, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634243995_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634243995", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634243995_cleaned", "chunk_index": 234, "text": "in the Fourth Book of Ezra in light of comparative Persian material,” and again draws direct comparisons between Ezra’s cup of fire, and the mang-mixed infused beverages of the Zoroastrian psychonauts.

(4Ezra 9:23-25). In the Jāmāsp Namag (also a pseudepigraphic text, written in the name of an old sage), Jāmāsp receives from Zoroaster the gift of knowledge by means of a flower. This is also the theme of the Pahlavi text Wizirkard i Denig 19… indeed, the tradition that described the acquisition of mystical knowledge by Jāmāsp resembles very much that of Ezra regarding the flowers, as the drinking of the blessed wine looks like the experience of 4Ezra 14 – the main difference in the passage being the fact that here we have two different seers [i.e. Jamasp & Vishtaspa] (Dobroruka, 2006). Dobroruka also compared Ezra’s chemically induced inspiration to other Biblical accounts, “The episode has parallels in the scroll eaten by Ezekiel (Ez 2:8-3:3) and thus to the author of the Book of Revelation (Ap 10:9-10), who also claims to have had sensory experiences related to ingestion” (Dobroruka, 2006). As noted in Chapter 11 the oldest existing copies of many of the Zoroastrian texts referred to are dated much later than the period in question (although they are thought to be adapted from older accounts) and for this reason, some might argue against a Persian influence on the accounts of Ezra, but as Dobroruka notes, this is not necessarily the case: The figure of Vishtaspa … is much older than the earliest Jewish apocalypses themselves (i.e. earlier than III century BCE) and … at least assures that the figure of Vishtasp cannot be later than that of Ezra.… [also there are the] fourth century BCE … fragments collectively known as the Oracle of Hystaspes [Greek Vishtaspa]). This is indirect evidence that late Persian texts contain cores that can be of earlier date … The theme of the cup that gives wisdom, being already present in the Yasna 10.17… [which] deals with the theme of the wisdom cup, in this case related to haoma: “Thereupon spake Zarathushtra: Praise to Haoma, Mazda-made. Good is Haoma, Mazda-made.

From the silver cup I pour Thee to the golden chalice over. Let me not thy (sacred) liquor spill to earth, of precious cost.” The dating of the Yasna depends on the dating attributed to Zoroaster, but even supposing the prophet to be a figure living as late as the sixth century BCE … the Yasna is much earlier than 4Ezra…. All this tends to support the idea that the two mythical themes examined that find way in 4Ezra (namely, that of the cup and that of the flower, both of which bestow wisdom) were, both by their antiquity and their frequency, primarily Persian ecstatic practices that found themselves echoed in a Jewish apocalypse (Dobroruka, 2006). Clearly, a strong Persian influence on the texts of the Hebrew Bible is undeniable. That this foreign influence included cannabis can now be seen to be equally obvious from the way that the two cultures utilized the plant for religious inspiration. It should also be noted that the marriage of the traditions of the Persians with those of the Semites bore fruit, and the child of this union has become one of the leading religions of the modern world … Christianity, with its Messianic message of a world savior, derived from the Persian concept of Saoshyant, but that is a story for another book… Clearly, until at least the time of Ezra, there was still no form of the Hebrew Bible as we know of it today. At the time of the Persian return the “mere idea that Ezra was ‘dictating’ sacred books (not yet canonical) implies that the Sinaitic revelation still had room to be enlarged, an idea that may reinforce the presence of the Holy Spirit in Ezra as he drank from the cup” (Dobroruka, 2006). Ezra does indeed seem to be the end of the entheogen-consuming prophets, that have graced the pages in this study. Notably, it seems after the period of Persian return of the Jews to their homeland either the ears of the prophets grew deaf, or the voice of Yahweh silent. Any evidence of shamanic practice soon faded shortly after the sphere of Persian influence receded to other Empirical forces. Through the Priestly editors, and rule, the classic Age of Prophets, ecstatic messages delivered in the name of the Lord, but rather focused on the rule and word of the law.

In the book of Jeremiah, we read the priestly edict that “any madman who acts like a prophet” should be put “into the stocks and neck-irons” ( Jeremiah 29:26). As the word of the Lord proclaims in the works of Zechariah, in the fifth century B.C.; “…if anyone still prophesies [makes to na’bi], his father and mother, to who he was born, will say to him, ‘You must die, because you have told lies in the Lord’s name’. When he prophesies, his own parents will stab him. On that day every prophet will be ashamed of his prophetic vision. He will not put on a prophet’s garment of hair in order to deceive. He will say, ‘I am not a prophet. I am a farmer; the land has been my livelihood since my youth’” (Zechariah 13:3- 5). In Incense and Poison Ordeals in the Ancient Orient Allen Godbey explained in 1930 in comparison to the seance rooms of his own day: One reason for the war of the Hebrew prophets upon the incense rituals of their time would be clearer to any person who would study the methods of modern seance-rooms. Much incense is a tradition of the profession, especially with those who make a business of “developing” mediumistic or clairvoyant powers in their disciples. A “trance gift” or power of “spirit vision” is sure to be discovered in those sensitive to a little narcotic stimulation. The mutterings of a half-stupefied disciple in a “pipe dream” are explained to others as “trance manifestation” or “spirit control.” All alienists know that even mild odors may stimulate neurotic subjects to imaginative visions.… A whole roomful – a “school of the prophets” of today – may thus be set gibbering. Some mediums, making a business of furnishing spirits upon demand, willy-nilly, have been known to make themselves complete “dope wrecks.” Such practices are known in all lands; observers report them from almost every savage tribe; they figure in a host of orgies and religious frenzies. The reader of the Arabian Nights may recall that in some tales spirits of jinn arise in the smoke of powders thrown on the fire.

The confusion created by these religious reforms and succession of Empires led to different factions in Judaism, such as the Sadducees, Pharisees, Rabbis, Essenes and Jewish Gnostic sects all of whom began to interpret things slightly differently and in some cases vied for power over the people. However, the account of Ezra’s fiery cup is not the only indication of infused wines and beverages in the Hebrew Bible and wider Near East. As with kaneh bosm, there seems to have been vastly different perceptions of this use with the various authors and editorial groups who composed the Hebrew Bible, a subject we will examine in the next chapter. he infusion of wines and other alcoholic beverages in the an-T cient world, with cannabis and other drugs, seems to have been at least as widespread as burning them as incense. As noted in the Encyclopedia Britannica (5th Edition) under ‘Drug Cults’: “The ceremonial use of wine and incense in contemporary ritual is probably a relic of a time when the psychological effects of these substances were designed to bring the worshiper into closer touch with supernatural forces” (Clark, 1978). That the two would be used in combination, and eventually combined, seems clear, and we have textual and archaeological evidence that this was the case, as well as clear indications of such preparations amongst the ancient Jews. As Professor Carl Ruck has explained: “Ancient wines were always fortified, like the ‘strong wine’ of the Old Testament, with herbal additives: opium, datura, belladonna, mandrake and henbane.1 Common incenses, such as myrrh, ambergris and frankincense are psychotropic; the easy availability and long tradition of cannabis use would have seen it included in the mixtures” (Ruck, 2003). This is not to say, that wine or beer alone were not used in religious rituals, they certainly were. Likely the earliest combination was simply using the two at the same time, and once it was realized fermented beverages could act as a carrier and diluter, this", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634243995_cleaned.txt:237:fd9d4dfe6508", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 2187, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634243995_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634243995", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634243995_cleaned", "chunk_index": 238, "text": "belladonna, mandrake and henbane.1 Common incenses, such as myrrh, ambergris and frankincense are psychotropic; the easy availability and long tradition of cannabis use would have seen it included in the mixtures” (Ruck, 2003). This is not to say, that wine or beer alone were not used in religious rituals, they certainly were. Likely the earliest combination was simply using the two at the same time, and once it was realized fermented beverages could act as a carrier and diluter, this likely saw the addition of such substances to wines and beers, to make them more potent, or in the case of some of the drugs used, less potent and less toxic. The Greeks were well aware of the plants around them, and the idea that they contained not only medicinal but magical properties, was widespread. Because it was believed “that certain drugs could secure the passionate love of another. Indian hemp, mandrake, opium, strychnos varieties, and others were greatly used as love charms and as stimulating aphrodisiacs” (Parsons, 1899). This saw them as contents in “love potions” or as they were known philtres, a word derived from the Greek philtron, which was used to describe a potion drunk to induce passion. “Pliny, the Roman writer, says the properties of these drugs became manifest even when merely taken into the hand, but more so when taken in dry wines; and that ‘overindulgence in them will cause death.’ This proves that most of these substances were no doubt stimulants and narcotics” (Parsons, 1899). Varieties of psychoactive plants were used in such infusions. According to Dioscorides and his commentator Matthiolus, one could “boil the root of mandrake in wine down to a third part, and preserve the decoction, of which they administer a cyathus (about a fluid ounce and a half), to produce sleep, and to allay severe pains of any part; and also before operations with the knife, or the application of the actual cautery, that the operation should not be felt.” As we noted 2nd century CE references from China, refer to the use of cannabis-infused wine for such operations. Theophrastus and Dioscorides are thought to have been the first to directly mention the soporific properties of mandrake (Atropa mandragora). Dioscorides also informs us that one dram of the root of “manic” nightshade (Atropa belladonna), taken in wine, elicits “empty forms” and “images of not unpleasant kind,” Pliny mentions that “the ancients were of opinion that the leaves [of henbane] act as a febrifuge, taken in wine” and he had a recipe for frankincense and myrrh wine.2 A variety of infused wines that are generally believed to contain cannabis, under the names “thalassaegle,” “potammaugis” and “gelotophyllis” were recorded by Democritus (c.a. 460 BCE). “Democritus’s famous recipe for a hemp wine is suitable for internal use: Macerate 1 teaspoon of myrrh … and a handful of hemp flowers in 1 litre of", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634243995_cleaned.txt:238:5efe2f419b4a", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 2188, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634243995_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634243995", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634243995_cleaned", "chunk_index": 239, "text": "ancients were of opinion that the leaves [of henbane] act as a febrifuge, taken in wine” and he had a recipe for frankincense and myrrh wine.2 A variety of infused wines that are generally believed to contain cannabis, under the names “thalassaegle,” “potammaugis” and “gelotophyllis” were recorded by Democritus (c.a. 460 BCE). “Democritus’s famous recipe for a hemp wine is suitable for internal use: Macerate 1 teaspoon of myrrh … and a handful of hemp flowers in 1 litre of retsina or dry Greek white wine … strain before drinking” (Rätsch, 2005). “The gelotophyllis of Pliny … a plant drunk in wine among the Bactrians, which produced immoderate laughter, may very well be identical with hemp, which still grows wild in the country around the Caspian and Aral Seas” (Houtsma, et al., 1936/1993). Pliny (23-79 A.D.) quotes the following description from Democritus: The Thalassaegall he speaks of as being found on the banks of the river Indus, from which circumstance it is also known as potamaugis. Taken in drink it produces delirium, which presents to the fancy visions of a most extraordinary nature. The theangelis, he says, grows upon Mount Libanus in Syria, upon the chain of mountains called Dicte in Crete, and at Babylon and Susa in Persia. An infusion of it imparts powers of divination to the Magi. The geolotophyllis, is a plant found in Bactriana [i.e. BMAC], and on the banks of the Borysthenes. Taken internally with myrrh and wine all sorts of visionary forms present themselves, excite the most immoderate laughter. Pliny mentions “An infusion of it imparts powers of divination to the Magi” in reference to the Zoroastrians, and we have already discussed a number of such preparations, in regard to the Zoroastrians and Ezra, as well as Professor Patrick McGovern’s theory on Soma. As McGovern has also noted of the Scythians “They would have had access to some of the ancient ingredients likely used in ancient haoma/ soma. At Pazyryk, the preferred beverage thus appears to have combined a marijuana high with an alcoholic buzz” (McGovern, 2009). The archaeological discovery of Scythian goblets with residues of both opium and cannabis are likely testaments to such combinations. lthough Egyptian references to cannabis under the name shemsh-A emet, or sm-sm- ⋅ t , generally refer to topical medical preparations of the plant, and give little indications of its use for psychoactive or spiritual purposes, there are other potential references that indicate cannabis was used in a wine infusion. Then Helen, daughter of Zeus … cast a drug into the wine whereof they drank, a drug to lull all pain and anger, and bring forgetfulness of every sorrow.

Medicines of such virtue and so helpful had the daughter of Zeus, which Polydamna, the wife of Thon, had given her, a woman of Egypt, where earth the grain-giver yields herbs in greatest plenty, many that are healing in the cup, and many baneful. There each man is a leech skilled beyond all human kind… The historian Diodorus Siculus, who lived in the 1st century BCE, noted that still in his time, more than 7 centuries after the composition of Homer’s Iliad, “people say that the Egyptian women make use of the powder (of this plant, scil. the nepenthes) and they say from ancient times only those women who lived in the ‘Town-of-Zeus’ [i.e. Thebes,] which was also known as Diospolis] had found medicines which cure wrath and grief. (1, 97, 1-9; Eus. PE 10, 8, 9-12; cf. also Ps.Iustinus, Cohort. ad gent. 26e). As Prof Carl Ruck has noted “It is generally assumed that the drug, which Helen is supposed to have learned in Egypt, was opium, but the effects as described in the poem are much more like Cannabis, which was also widely employed in Egypt and throughout the Near East” (Ruck, et al., 2007). As well, the Greeks were very familiar with opium, and knew of its effects directly, while the ingredients of the nepenthe were more of a mystery to them. Numerous researchers have seen nepenthe as a cannabis concoction. An idea first put forth by the French Pharmacist Joseph Virey (1775-1846) who suggested in 1813 that hasheesh was Homer’s nepenthe (Bulletin de Pharmacie). Many others have since concurred: “The opinions entertained by the learned, on the nature of the Nepenthe of the ancients have been various. By Th. Zwinger, and … by Sprengel, in his history of botany, it is supposed to be opium.… But the best authorities, with whom our author coincides, are of opinion that the Nepenthe was derived from the Cannabis sativa of Linnaeus” (Christen, 1822); “the famous nepenthe of the ancients is said to have been prepared by decocting the hemp leaves” (Watt, 1853); “nepenthe which may reasonably be surmised was bhang from the far east” (Benjamin, 1880). As the authors of The Manners and Customs of the Ancient Egyptians also concluded: “Nepenthes … Perhaps the Bust or Hasheesh, a preparation of the Cannabis sativa” (Wilkinson", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634243995_cleaned.txt:240:f5895f042d8c", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 2190, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634243995_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634243995", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634243995_cleaned", "chunk_index": 241, "text": "our author coincides, are of opinion that the Nepenthe was derived from the Cannabis sativa of Linnaeus” (Christen, 1822); “the famous nepenthe of the ancients is said to have been prepared by decocting the hemp leaves” (Watt, 1853); “nepenthe which may reasonably be surmised was bhang from the far east” (Benjamin, 1880). As the authors of The Manners and Customs of the Ancient Egyptians also concluded: “Nepenthes … Perhaps the Bust or Hasheesh, a preparation of the Cannabis sativa” (Wilkinson & Birch, 1878). See also (Walton, 1938; Burton, 1894; Lewin, 1931; Singer and Underwood, 1962; Oursler, 1968; Wills, 1998). It is clearly the Nepenthe that Prof Richard Evans Schultes and Prof. Albert Hofmann are referring to when they write in a chapter on cannabis “In ancient Thebes the plant was made into a drink with opium like effects” (Schultes & Hofmann, 1979). In A Glossary of Colloquial Anglo-Indian Words and Phrases, Yule and Crooke note an interesting connection between a Coptic (Greek-Egyptian) term and the nepenthe; “Bhang is usually derived from Skt. Bhanga, ‘breaking,’ but [Sir Richard] Burton derives both it and the Ar. Banj from the old Coptic Nibanj, ‘meaning a preparation of hemp; and here it is easy to recognize the Homeric Nepenthe’” (Yule, et al., 1903/1996). As Abram Smythe Palmer also notes in Folk-etymology: “Nepenthe, the drug which Helen brought from Egypt, is without doubt the Coptic nibendj, which is the plural of bendj, or benj, hemp, ‘bang,’ used as an intoxicant” (Palmer, 1882). When one returns to the contemporary Avestan term for cannabis, b’aŋ’ha, the similarity in this context, ne- b’aŋ’ha, brings us even closer to the cognate pronunciation ‘nepenthe.’ The Hebrew term “pannag,” which Dr. Raphael Mechoulam believes identifies a preparation of cannabis (Mechoulam, et al., 1991) is also similar. Interestingly, as nepenthe was a powder, it is notable that both of these terms are believed to identify prepared forms of cannabis as well. nfused wines play a considerable role in the recent New York Times’ I bestseller, The Immortality Key, and one of the more intriguing pieces of evidence put forth by the author Brian Muraresku, was the discovery of an infusion that contained a whole host of ingredients, including things like opium, cannabis henbane, alongside lizard and snake remains, walnuts, and other various spices and herbs. Although the authors of the archaeological study of this find, “Drug preparation in evidence? An unusual plant and bone assemblage from the Pompeian countryside, Italy” have identified this as likely evidence of a theriac, a potent medical infusion that was the basis for later alchemical quintessences and arcanums, due to the area of preparation and the list of ingredients, Muraresku has suggested this may have been the sort of drink used in the Dionysian and potentially other Greek Mysteries.

The location of the archaeological find referred to was in excellent condition, due to its preservation under pumice from the most famous volcano eruption in history. The structure on the site was a home that contained a wine press and threshing floor, wine cellar, and large vessels which contained thick organic deposits, which were identified as infusions of various plants, common fruits and nuts, and even bones of lizards, “suggesting the combination of plants, reptiles, and amphibians was steeped in wine” (Muraresku, 2020). As Muraresku notes however, “the real kicker was the distinctive medley of opium (Papaver somniferum), cannabis (Cannabis sativa) and two members of the nightshade family, white henbane (Hysoscyamus albus) and black nightshade (Solanum nigrum)” (Muraresku, 2020). A potent infusion indeed! Although acknowledging the lack of clear context of the find, and the evidence it was for a medical preparation of the time such as theriac or mithrediatnium, Muraresku speculates and questions whether this site could represent “a laboratory for the production of a Dionysian sacrament that could have been used in the Villa of Mysteries that was within walking distance, just West across Pompeii?” (Muraresku, 2020) In discussions with an archaeologist who was directly involved on the ground level of the find, Muraresku garnered even further evidence than was put forth in the original paper. The archaeologist involved suggested the site was “specifically designed for the production of drugs,” and from the discussion Muraresku says the resulting mixture “seems to be a boutique house wine not intended for mass consumption” (Muraresku, 2020). Indications from the garden remains outside of the structure, are that it was a site for producing a select variety of plants and herbs. Evidence of a “maceration tank for cannabis” would seem to indicate this was particularly a key component in the infusion. 2nd century B.C., led by researcher Hervé Delhoofs, yielded an earthenware vessel that once held a most potent potable: Analysis of plant material confirmed the presence of “biomarkers” for wine, resin and THC. Did the Gauls simply like the taste, or were they interested in a more, well, holistic experience?

There are indications of infused wines, and stronger preparations such as the Biblical “strong drink” (shekar): “An inebriating Potion described in the Old Testament; but distinct from Wine; probably a Soporific or visionary vinous infusion” (Ott 1995). As Entheobotanist Jonathan Ott has noted: Like the ancient Greeks, the ancient Israelites did not know distillation technology, but possessed an inebriant other than wine, which apparently was more potent. Was the Biblical shekar, “strong drink,” not an inebriating potion analogous to the ancient Greek wines, some of which were entheogenic potions? Down through history there are innumerable instances of the addition of psychoactive plants to wines and other alcoholic beverages (Ott, 1993). As we have already seen, such concoctions were used ritually throughout the Near East and the recently late ethnobotanist Christian Rätsch suggests from the description of the effects of an “inebriating beverage” referred to in a Mesopotamian texts, the intoxicant was not a simple alcoholic drink, but likely contained “tropane alkaloids as well as opium or hemp” (Rätsch 1997). In A Cyclopaedia of Biblical Literature. Kitto noted: “The palm wine of the East … is made intoxicating … by an admixture of stupefying ingredients, of which there was an abundance… Such a practice seems to have existed amongst the ancient Jews….” (Kitto, 1846). Kitto, saw the Hebrew references to eshisha, which he equated with some sort of prepared cannabis syrup or resin product, discussed in Chapter 4 in this context, suggesting it was mixed into wine. Interestingly,in Mishnic times cannabis could be grown alongside grape vines. This is notable as it indicates that cannabis did not violate the prohibitions of Kil’ayim (Hebrew: םיאלכ ‎, lit. “mixture,” or “diverse kinds”) which defined the prohibitions in Jewish law which proscribe the planting of certain mixtures of seeds, grafting, the mixing of plants in vineyards, the crossbreeding of animals, the mixing of wool with linen in garments, and other details. The Sages of Israel referred to a prohibition of growing different kinds of crops in a vineyard. They identified only two grain varieties (such as wheat and barley), or either hemp and arum, being permitted.3 By a rabbinic prohibition, it was not permitted to plant or maintain a vineyard while the vineyard shares the same immediate ground with any vegetable or seed-crop grown for food.", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634243995_cleaned.txt:243:59279bae64c3", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 2193, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634243995_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634243995", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634243995_cleaned", "chunk_index": 244, "text": "the crossbreeding of animals, the mixing of wool with linen in garments, and other details.

The allowing of cannabis to be grown, would have been designated by some sort of shared association with the vine. Barley and wheat produce beer, and likely in the case of cannabis this shared association was intoxication. Jews were more humane in their method of dealing with condemned criminals than the Greeks or the Romans. In the Talmudic writings there are several passages which seem to show that it was the practice to ease the pain of torture and death by stupefying the sufferers. Thus: “If a man is led forth to death, he is given a cup of spiced wine to drink, whereby his soul is wrapped in night;” and again: “Give a stupefying drink to him that loseth his life, and wine to those that carry bitterness in their hearts.” According to tradition, while the Roman conqueror held sway in Palestine, and crucifixion was a common punishment of malefactors, the Jewish women, with the sanction of the Sanhedrin, were wont to ease the death–agony of the sufferers by giving them something in the nature of a “wine of the condemned” upon a sponge. It is probable that the “wine mingled with myrrh,” which, according to St. Mark (xv. 23), was offered to Christ while he was hanging on the cross, was a narcotic draft intended to make death painless. It appears to have been an ancient custom to give medicated or drugged wine to criminals condemned to death, to blunt their senses, and so lessen the pains of execution. To this custom there is supposed to be an allusion, Prov. xxxi. 6, “Give strong drink unto him that is ready to perish,” …To the same custom some suppose there is a reference in Amos 2:8, where the “wine of the condemned” is spoken of.… The wicked here described, in addition to other evil practices, imposed unjust fines upon the innocent, and spent the money thus unjustly obtained upon wine, which they “quaffed in the house of their gods”… Mixed wine is often spoken of in Scripture. This was of different kinds … sometimes, by lovers of strong drink, with spices of various kinds, to give it a richer flavor and greater potency (ls. v. 22; Ps. lxxv. 8). The “royal wine,” literally wine of the kingdom … Esther i. 7), denotes most probably the best wine, such as the king of Persia himself was accustomed to drink (Lawrence,", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634243995_cleaned.txt:244:4e4afccabe8a", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 2194, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634243995_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634243995", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634243995_cleaned", "chunk_index": 245, "text": "wine, which they “quaffed in the house of their gods”… Mixed wine is often spoken of in Scripture.

The “royal wine,” literally wine of the kingdom … Esther i. 7), denotes most probably the best wine, such as the king of Persia himself was accustomed to drink (Lawrence, 1871). This view on pain-dulling infused wines was a considerably widespread view in the 19th century. The New York Dental Journal reported: “Among the Hebrews and Egyptians, it was customary to give a preparation of hemp to a condemned prisoner, just previous to his execution; some of the Biblical commentaries assert that the gall and vinegar, mentioned in Scripture as having been given to Christ on a sponge, was in reality what the Prophet Amos calls ‘wine of the condemned,’ doubtless the Bhang of the Hindoo Suttee at the present day” (Roberts, 1862). That this infused wine, not only had pain numbing qualities, but was also “quaffed in the house of their gods” gives clear indication it was sought after for entheogenic effects as well. That it is compared to the wines of the King of Persia, also brings us back to the cannabis infused wines of the Zoroastrian period, such as that taken by King Vistashpa, referred to earlier. In The A to Z of Prophets in Islam and Judaism, Scott B. Noegel, Brannon M. Wheeler, “The use of drugs, especially alcohol … as a means of inducing or enhancing the prophetic experience is attested periodically throughout the ancient Near East, and is probably related to the mantic’s role as an herbalist and medical practitioner” (Noegel & Wheeler, 2010). Evidence for opium use has been found throughout the ancient Near East, especially on Cyprus, though its connection to Cypriot cults has been questioned. The practice of inhaling intoxicating substances like cannabis and incense also appear.… Texts from Mari demonstrate that at least some prophets partook in excessive wine drinking as a means of accessing the divine. Ugaritic tablets also detail the events of the marzeah feast, a repast in which … dead kings were summoned to wine and dine with the living… (Noegel & Wheeler, 2010). It seems plausible that prepared opium may have been used in the marzeah feast.

Recently, the paper “Opium trade and use during the Late Bronze Age: Organic residue analysis of ceramic vessels from the burials of Tel Yehud, Israel” (Linares, Jakoel, Be’eri, Lipschits, Neumann & Gadot, 2022) provided archaeological evidence of ritual opium use at a vast Canaanite Necropolis dating back to the 14th century BCE. Residues of opium were recovered from poppy-shaped ceramic vessels, further confirming a hypothesis that such vessels were particularly designated for holding opium extracts. Opium was indeed extracted and collected into Cypriot Base-Ring ware for the purpose of trade in and around the Levant. The opium was most likely used in a number of ways: for medicinal, cultic and ritualistic purposes, as many Cypriot vessels were found in a variety of contexts, signifying its use either for burial rites and/or as an offering for the dead. The fact that we see signals of much lower concentrations of opium alkaloids in locally produced storage jars and juglets suggests one of two things: (1) the material of the locally produced vessels and the more porous ceramic in comparison to the highly fired and finely made Base-Ring ware played a role in the preservation of such alkaloids; (2) once the opium reached the Levant, the local inhabitants may have diluted the opium in some cases into storage jars containing some kind of plant carrier oil. This may have been done in order to stretch out and/or preserve the opium for longer. Another suggestion for the diluting of the opium might have been to reduce the potency of the stimulant (Linares, Jakoel, Be’eri, Lipschits, Neumann & Gadot, 2022). The use of … mid-altering substances may explain an important but previously unknown cognitive aspect of Canaanite funerary ritual. Opiates such as morphine are powerful narcotics which can cause euphoria, hallucination, and dissociation, a feeling of being outside of one’s body. Dissociation may have been the goal. In the ancient Near East, the dead could simultaneously exist in embodied and disembodied forms.… Through opium induced effects of corporeal dissociation, mourners could have achieved similar states of dual embodiment, blurring the lines between living and dead bodies.… Temporarily, the realms of the living and the dead could have been united through the use of psychoactive substances (Cradic, 20220). Like Amos’ condemnation of those who “quaffed” such mixtures in the “House of the God,” Isaiah condemned those who seek oracles from the dead through inebriation. Apparently, the Yahwehist prophet Isaiah was particularly incensed with the techniques of prophetic ecstasy as practiced in the northern kingdom, which would seem to be yet another carryover from the Canaanite cult of El; “These, too, reel with wine, With strong-drink they stagger; Priest and prophet stagger with strong-drink, dazed with wine, Reeling with strong-drink. They stagger when seeing visions, they stumble when rendering decisions. All the tables full of vomit, Excrement without place”(Isaiah 28:7-9).

They stagger when seeing visions, they stumble when rendering decisions. All the tables full of vomit, Excrement without place”(Isaiah 28:7-9). The northern prophets likely took such entheogenic infusions in emulation of El, whose mythology had become fused with that of Yahweh. Like the ecstatic excess attributed to the northern prophets, are those of the god El whose shrines they had rededicated to their own synchronistic El-Yahweh; “El offered game in his house… He invited the gods to mess. The gods ate and drank, Drank wine till sated, Must till inebriated … El … drank wine till sated, Must till inebriated.… An apparition accosted him, With horns and a tail. He floundered in his excrement and urine. El collapsed…” From these passages we can see that both God and prophets literally took themselves into a “shitfaced” drunken stupor in order to induce prophetic trance. In reference to Isaiah 5:22: “Woe to those who are heroes at drinking wine and champions at mixing drinks” The Ultimate Bible Dictionary, editor Matthew George Easton recorded the following entry from John Adams (1735-1826) a highly educated and enlightened lawyer who became a central figure in the American Revolution. Adams explained the Hebrew term mesekh, used in this passage, is “properly a mixture of wine and water with spices that increase its stimulating properties (Isa 5:22). Psa 75:8, ‘The wine [yayin] is red; it is full of mixture [mesekh];’ Prov 23:30, ‘mixed wine;’ Isa 65:11, ‘drink offering’ (R.V., ‘mingled wine’) … Mesek, ‘a mixture,’ mixed or spiced wine, not diluted with water, but mixed with drugs and spices to increase its strength… (Psa 75:8; Prov 23:30)” (Adams/Easton, 1897). Adams also noted the Hebrew tirosh, “translated ‘wine’ (Deut 28:51); ‘new wine’ (Prov 3:10); ‘sweet wine (Micah 6:15). This Hebrew word has been traced to a root meaning ‘to take possession of’ and hence it is supposed that tirosh is so designated because in intoxicating it takes possession of the brain” (Adams/Easton, 1897). However, the ancient Hebrews had little understanding of chemicals and their effects on the brain, so it would seem more likely that an actual spiritual possession is intended in the meaning. Isaiah contains further condemnation of these revelries which in this instance sound like harmless music-filled celebrations: “Woe to those who rise early in the morning that they may follow strongdrink, who stay up late at night till they are inflamed with wine. They have harps and lyres at their banquets, tambourines and flutes and wine, but they have no regard for the deeds of the Lord, no respect for the", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634243995_cleaned.txt:247:937985d59d0a", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 2197, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634243995_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634243995", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634243995_cleaned", "chunk_index": 248, "text": "that an actual spiritual possession is intended in the meaning.

They have harps and lyres at their banquets, tambourines and flutes and wine, but they have no regard for the deeds of the Lord, no respect for the work of his hands” (5:11-12). The angry Yahwhist prophet sees the free-spirited revelers as “dogs with mighty appetites; they never have enough … ‘Come’, each one cries, ‘let me get wine! Let us have our fill of strong-drink! And tomorrow will be like today, or even far better” (Isaiah 56:11-12). Sentiments echoed by Habakkuk, who was active around 612 BC, “Woe to you who make your neighbors drink, who mix in your venom [i.e. drugs or herbs] even to make them drunk so as to look on their nakedness!” (Habakkuk 2:15). Similarly Micah condemns those who “prophecy for … plenty of wine and strong-drink” (Micah 2:11). And again, Amos: “They lie down by every altar on clothes taken in pledge, And drink the wine of the condemned in the house of their god” (Amos 2:8). The earth is defiled by its people; they have disobeyed the laws, violated the statutes and broken the everlasting covenant. Therefore a curse consumes the earth; its people must bear their guilt. Therefore earth’s inhabitants are burned up, very few are left. The new wine dries up and the vine withers; all the merrymakers groan. The gaiety of the tambourine is stilled, the noise of the revelers stopped, the joyful harp is silent. No longer do they drink wine with song; the strong-drink is bitter to its drinkers. –Isaiah 24:5-9 It is interesting to also note that Vicente Dobroruka saw Jeremiah as condemning practices such as those alluded to in the story of Ezra and the Persian accounts as well. “There seems to be a parallel, if in different settings and intentions, between the cup that maddens the nations in Jr 25:15-16” ( Dobroruka, 2002). So I took the cup from the Lord’s hand and made all the nations to whom he sent me drink it: Jerusalem and the towns of Judah, its kings and officials, to make them a ruin and an object of horror and scorn, a curse – as they are today; Pharaoh king of Egypt, his attendants, his officials and all his people, and all the foreign people there; all the kings of Uz ; all the kings of the Philistines (those of Ashkelon, Gaza, Ekron, and the people left at Ashdod); Edom, Moab and Ammon; all the kings of Tyre and Sidon; the kings of the coastlands across the sea; Dedan, Tema, Buz and all who are in distant places;", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634243995_cleaned.txt:248:4b2a42519b3c", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 2198, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634243995_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634243995", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634243995_cleaned", "chunk_index": 249, "text": "horror and scorn, a curse – as they are today; Pharaoh king of Egypt, his attendants, his officials and all his people, and all the foreign people there; all the kings of Uz ; all the kings of the Philistines (those of Ashkelon, Gaza, Ekron, and the people left at Ashdod); Edom, Moab and Ammon; all the kings of Tyre and Sidon; the kings of the coastlands across the sea; Dedan, Tema, Buz and all who are in distant places; all the kings of Arabia and all the kings of the foreign people who live in the wilderness; all the kings of Zimri, Elam and Media; and all the kings of the north, near and far, one after the other – all the kingdoms on the face of the earth. And after all of them, the king of Sheshak will drink it too ( Jeremiah 15-26). Babylon [claimed to be] a cup of gold in the hand of Yahu, That made all lands to reel. Of her wine the nations drank So that the peoples went mad. Suddenly Babylon falls and is convulsion-rent! Wail over her - get balsam for her wounds - perhaps she can be cured? We would like to cure Babylon, But she cannot be cured! Leave her there, and let us all go home! For her doom rises to heaven, And touches the very skies ( Jeremiah 51:6). As Dobroruka noted, these practices were demonized as a foreign influence: “Chemical induction related to the visionary present the most ‘paganizing’ reference to the means for inspiration found among the apocalypticists (i.e. the passages that most resemble pagan practices of artificial ecstatic practices); this may be so for the same reason that ‘classical prophets’ have a ‘calmer’ ecstasy than their pagan counterparts, i.e. for editorial reasons” (Dobroruka, 2006). Clearly Jeremiah condemned the “cup” for the same reasons as he did the incense burning and drink offerings of former priests and kings; like the modern religious elite, and the Priestly editors and writers that followed him, his only interest was in the stated law, there was no room for new revelation. The references to the pouring out of drink offerings to the Queen of Heaven, as well as references to cannabis infused beer, likely dedicated to Ishtar under her title Beltu (Lady), may also be a source of Jeremiah’s condemnation. This, as well, brings forth imagery from the New Testament’s Book of Revelation, with the “Whore of Babylon” holding up her “cup full of abominations.” Something to consider with the text’s concern about sorcery, which is translated from the original Greek renderings, ‘pharmakeia’ a term directly related to the use of herbs in magic, as well as derived from the same root word for the modern term ‘pharmacy’.

These references show, even though in a negative light, that such cultic practices as the induction of altered states through wine infusions were both known and taking place in the region. Rabbi Immanuel Löw, a rabbi and scholar, in Die Flora Der Juden, (1967); [originally published as Flora der Juden (1924)], referred to a later Jewish recipe (Sabb. 14. 3 ed. Urbach, 9th-11th century) that indicates the use of such infusions in the medieval period, and which called for wine to be mixed with ground-up saffron, Arabic gum and hasisat surur, “I know ‘surur’ solely as an alias for the resin the Cannabis sativa,” (Löw, 1924). Löw made no comment on the word “hasisat” which is very reminiscent of the name for cannabis resins in the medieval Arabic world “hasis” (hashish), and the term is generally thought to have been derived in that period. In Liber 420 I discuss 13th century Jewish alchemical references to various herbal wine infusions, known as a Quintessence. Notable use continued into the first centuries of the Common Era. The Catholic Church Father Irenaeus condemned the Gnostic leader Marcus, stating the latter had a familiar demon by whose aid he was able to prophesy, and that he pretended to confer this gift upon others by means of philtres and love potions which he compounded. Zosimos the alchemist, in the 3rd-4th century, who was influenced by Jewish and Gnostic cosmologies, referred to beer infusions of “borage, cannabis seeds and leaves, helenium, ivy leaves, strychnine, and darnel” being used for magical rites (Bennett, 2018). It has even long been suggested that Jesus himself quaffed such a preparation in his own moment of doubt and pain.“Some high Biblical commentators maintain that the gall and vinegar, or myrrhed wine, offered to our Saviour immediately before his crucifixion, was in all probability a preparation of hemp, and even speak of its earlier use” The Boston Medical and Surgical Journal (1860). Wine infused with ‘vine branches’ alongside an incense that contained a ‘wonder’ are described as being administered by Jesus himself in magic rites in the 3-4th century CE Gnostic text The Second Book of Jue (Bennett, 2010: 2018). “Other heretics with Gnostic views who were accused of magic … were the followers of Carpicrates, who employed incantations and spells, philtres and potions … and who pretended to have great power over things … by magic” (Thorndike, 1923). Accusations of using such infusions may have even been directed at Jesus in New Testament accounts. “The commonly attested connection between mantic behavior and", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634243995_cleaned.txt:250:d232159af367", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 2200, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634243995_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634243995", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634243995_cleaned", "chunk_index": 251, "text": "magic rites in the 3-4th century CE Gnostic text The Second Book of Jue (Bennett, 2010: 2018). “Other heretics with Gnostic views who were accused of magic … were the followers of Carpicrates, who employed incantations and spells, philtres and potions … and who pretended to have great power over things … by magic” (Thorndike, 1923). Accusations of using such infusions may have even been directed at Jesus in New Testament accounts. “The commonly attested connection between mantic behavior and alcohol probably explains the reference in the New Testament that some people thought Jesus to be a wine-bibber (Matt 11:19). The use of drugs was so closely tied to mantic practice that the Greek word for ‘drug’ [Gk. pharmakea] eventually came to denote witchcraft (Gal 5:19-21)” (Noegel & Wheeler, 2010). More recently The Immortality Key (2020) suggested that an infused wine may lie behind the origins of the Christian Eucharist. The use of such infusions continued through to the Islamic period into near modern times (Rosenthal, 1971: Bennett 2010:2018). An 1862 article in All the Year Round, “What Wine Does For Us” contained a passage which states “the Jewish and Armenian dealers ministering to that fondness for narcotics which tend so greatly to enervate the East, by mixing myrrh, incense, and the juice of the Indian hemp with the finest growth.”4 Dionysus and Infused WinesNo discussion of wine would be complete without reference to ever syncretic Yahweh, became conflated during the time of Greek rule. This has been equated with the love of both cults for wine. As well, a number of scholars have suggested the use of cannabis and other drugs by the cult of Dionysus, and this includes wine infusions. Thyia, was the first priestess of Dionysus, according to tradition, and her name comes from the ancient verb $\\theta \\mathrm { \\dot { v } } \\omega = \\mathrm { \\ddot { \\Omega } }$ sacrifice” or “incense,” as she was the first to sacrifice to Dionysus, and her first offering came in the form of incense. Renaissance man, ethnobotanist and poet, Dale Pendell noted of this; “Dionysus’s home was usually assumed to be Thrace … whose shamans used hemp smoke to induce visions and oracular trances. Hemp probably came to Thrace through Central Asia and the Caucasus. A … similar route may have been followed by the grapevine.… It is … possible that … Dionysus carried not only the vine but ganja as well” (Pendell 1995). Pendell is by no means out on the fringe with this view, Professor Mircea Eliade, a respected source on the history of religions whom we have cited a number of times in this study, referred to elements of shamanism in the Thracian cult of Dionysus, and suggested their use of cannabis: “Prophecy in Thrace was connected with the cult of ‘Dionysus,’ a certain tribe, that of the Bessi, managed the oracle", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634243995_cleaned.txt:251:cfef061ab1a5", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 2201, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634243995_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634243995", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634243995_cleaned", "chunk_index": 252, "text": "only the vine but ganja as well” (Pendell 1995).

The separation of soul from body, determined by ecstasy, revealed … the fundamental duality of man … [and] the possibility of a purely, spiritual post-experience…Ecstasy could … be brought on by certain dried herbs… (Eliade,1982). The Kapnobatai, or Smoke-walkers, burned cannabis believing that the living entity within the plant reassembled itself inside their bodies to give divine revelations. In the 1925 English translation of the German work, Psyche, Seelencult und Unsterblichkeitsglaube der Griechen (1890-1894); “Psyche: The Cult of Souls and the Belief in Immortality Among the Greeks,” in a chapter on “The Thracian Worship of Dionysus” the great 19th century German classical scholar, Erwin Rohde, pointed to their likely use of cannabis. Referring to the set and setting of Dionysian ritual, Rohde described that it was “something more than a mere drama, for it can hardly be doubted the players themselves were possessed by the illusion of living the life of a strange person”: The awe-inspiring darkness of night, the music, especially that of the Phrygrian flute, to which the Greeks attributed the power of making its hearers “full of the god,” the verities whirl of the dance – all these may very well, in suitably disposed natures, have rally led to a state of visionary exaltation in which inspired persons saw all external objects in accordance with his fancy and imagination. Intoxicating drinks, to which the Thracians were addicted, may have increased the excitement; perhaps they even used the fumes derived from certain seeds, with which the Scythians and Massagetai knew how to intoxicate themselves. We all know how even to day in the East the smoke of hashish may make men visionaries and excite religious raptures in which the whole nature is transformed for the enthralled dreamer…. Every detail confirms the picture of a condition of wild excitement in which limitations of ordinary life seem to be abolished.

These extraordinary phenomena transcending all normal experience were explained by saying that the soul of a person thus “possessed” was no longer “at home” but “abroad,” having left its body behind. This was the literal and primitive meaning understood by the Greek when he spoke of “ekstasis” of the soul in such orgiastic conditions of excitement. This ekstasis is “a brief madness,” just as madness is prolonged ekstasis. But the ekstasis, the temporary alienatio mentis of the Dionysian cult was not thought of as again purposeless wandering in the region of pure delusion, but as a hieromania, a sacred madness in which the soul, leaving the body, winged its way to union with the god. It is now with the god, in the condition of enthusiasmos; those who are possessed … have their being in the God. While still retaining the finite ego, they feel and enjoy to the full the infinite power of all life (Rohde, 1925). There can be no doubt it was hemp-seed [i.e. seeded buds]… which had this effect … the Thracians knew hemp. It was thus with a sort of hashish that they intoxicated themselves.… The Thracians … may very well have used intoxication through hashish-fumes as a means of exciting themselves to their ecstatic religious dances. – The Ancients were quite familiar with the practice of inhaling aromatic smoke to produce religious hallucinations… We have only to read the accounts derived from personal experience of the hallucinatory states accompanying hashish-smoking … to have a complete parallel to the condition which underlay Bacchic excitement… It only requires the special tone and character given the hallucinations and illusions by deep-rooted religious or fanciful conceptions – and the external machinery for cultivating such illusions – to make an exact equivalent of the delirious condition of … the nightly festival of Dionysus. (The helpless state of impressionability to outward – e.g. musical – and inward influences is a marked feature of the intoxication and fantasia of hashish.) Other narcotics also have similar effects (Rohde, 1925). More recently, the Professor of Classics and pioneer of entheogen research in the classic world, Carl Ruck has suggested cannabis was likely used in Dionysian wine infusions. “Since the wine of Dionysus is a mediation between the god’s wild herbal ancestors and the civilized phenomenon of his cultivated and manufactured manifestation in the product fermented from the juice of the grape, it is most probable that this was the way in which the Greeks incorporated hemp into their pharmacopoeia” (Ruck, 2007). Ruck suggests that cannabis may have played a role in the historical pairing of the Indian God Shiva, who is still known for his love of cannabis,", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634243995_cleaned.txt:253:42562f80c955", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 2203, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634243995_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634243995", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634243995_cleaned", "chunk_index": 254, "text": "the wine of Dionysus is a mediation between the god’s wild herbal ancestors and the civilized phenomenon of his cultivated and manufactured manifestation in the product fermented from the juice of the grape, it is most probable that this was the way in which the Greeks incorporated hemp into their pharmacopoeia” (Ruck, 2007). Ruck suggests that cannabis may have played a role in the historical pairing of the Indian God Shiva, who is still known for his love of cannabis, and the Greek Dionysus, that took place during Alexander the Great’s campaign into India. With the triumph of Alexander, as Prof. Carl Ruck has noted “Dionysus … was also said to have returned triumphantly from travels to India, where he would inevitably have been assimilated with the god Shiva, with whom he shares many iconographic similarities, to the extent that they may have been originally the same deity, and both involved with the hemp sacrament (Ruck, et al., 2007). It was recorded during the time of Alexander, when the cult of Dionysus traveled to India, the Greek god was recognized by the followers of Shiva, as one and the same. Even in pre-Alexandrian existing Greek myth, it was seen that Dionysus may have been raised in India, with Alexander believing he had rediscovered the mythical place of Dionysus’ childhood, Nysa, there. Nysa (Greek: Νῦσα), was the traditional place where the rain nymphs, the Hyades, raised the infant god Dionysus, the “Zeus of Nysa.” The two deities do share a lot of symbolism, wearing leopard skins, traveling with a bull, serpents and intoxication. When you look at the wealth of animal/man metamorphosis in India in this respect, compared to the sorts of human/animal crossbreeds in images of Dionysus, it does seem plausible there may have been an earlier cross-cultural pollination at some sort. The observation that … ancient writers did identify Dionysus with Siva has won the almost unanimous approval of scholars … because of the many similarities between the cult of Dionysus and that of Shaivite devotees … both are said to cure the sick and to have provided the Indians with weapons; both are associated with plowing, with figs and vineyards, with mountains, and with dancing; and both are depicted as having long, bushy hair and carrying a spear or trident (Cowan, 2010). Shiva, the oldest continually worshiped God on Earth, is well known for his fondness for bhang (cannabis). This relationship is very ancient, and its ritual offering of cannabis to Shiva has continued to the modern day. In the Rudrayamal Danakand and Karmakand Shiva tells his consort: “Oh Goddess, Parvati, hear the benefits derived from bhang.

In the Rudrayamal Danakand and Karmakand Shiva tells his consort: “Oh Goddess, Parvati, hear the benefits derived from bhang. The worship of bhang raises one to my position.” As the 19th century Indian Hemp Drugs Commission Report recorded of Shiva’s cultic connection to cannabis: It is chiefly in connection with the worship of Siva, the … great god of the Hindu trinity, that the hemp plant, and more especially perhaps ganja, is associated. The hemp plant is popularly believed to have been a great favorite of Siva, and … the drug in some form or other is … extensively used in the exercise of the religious practices connected with this form of worship.… [R]eligious ascetics, who are regarded with great veneration by the people at large, believe that the hemp plant is a special attribute of the god Siva, and this belief is largely shared by the people.… There is evidence to show that on almost all occasions of the worship of this god, the hemp drugs in some form or other are used … these customs are so intimately connected with their worship that they may be considered to form in some sense an integral part of it.(IHDCR, 1894). In Gods of Love and Ecstasy: The Traditions of Shiva and Dionysus, the noted Orientalist scholar Alain Danielou, the first Westerner initiated into the cult of Shiva, also points to the similarities between Dionysus and the Indian god of hemp, Shiva, suggesting the two have their origin in the same figure; “Greek texts speak of Dionysus’ mission to India, and Indian texts of the expansion of Shivaism to the West…Innumerable similarities in mythological accounts and icongraphic survivals leave no doubt as to the original unity of Shivaism and the wide extent of its influence” (Danielou 1992). As Robert Cowan noted in The Indo-German Identification: Reconciling South Asian Origins and European Destinies (2010): Roman writers would associate the Greek god Dionysus with the Hindu Siva [Shiva].… Dionysus, the Greek god of wine and mystical ecstasy was purported to have journeyed to India, subdued the Aryan and Dravidian peoples, absorbed their philosophies, and returned to Europe with their chief ideas. Euripides describes Dionysus in Bacchae (406 B.C.) as a provider of knowledge and the conqueror of Arabia, Persia and Bactria”6 : Polyaenus goes so far as to say that Dionysus got the Indians drunk before attacking them and used baccanatic orgies as part of his military strategy for subjugating all of the Asian continent….

As Shiva’s cult is not only known for their use of cannabis, but also at times, wine and other potent narcotics such as henbane and datura, it is not surprising that many have suggested such ingredients in the Dionysian infusions as well. In Shiva: The Wild God of Power and Ecstasy (2004) Wolf-Dieter Storl suggests that “It is possible that Shiva and Kali are historically connected with Dionysus and his mother – legend has it that the … of their cults. More likely, the tropane-alkaloid responsible for ancient Greek Dionysian revelry was derived from mandrake or henbane” (Storl, 2004). In this respect it is worth again noting Marvin Pope’s suggestion of a connection between Kali and Shiva with Baal and Anath, and the latter couple’s potential influence on the Song of Songs. It is well known and accepted that the Amrita, of Hindu mythology, a drink which confers immortality on the gods, is a cognate of ambrosia. The Greek ἀμβροσία (ambrosia) is semantically linked to the Sanskrit (amṛta) as both words denote a drink or food that gods use to achieve immortality. The two words appear to be derived from the same Indo-European form _(η)^(*) -mṛ-tós, “un-dying.” Here again, we may have indications of an earlier cultural connection in myth and etymology. As well, in Indian texts Amrita is identified with Soma. It should also be noted that the aforementioned Indo-European group, the Scythians, have been tied to the worship of both Shiva and Dionysus. Gold coins minted during the Scythian period of Northern India (200 BCE- 200CE) depict a Scythian king dressed as Shiva, as well as Shiva with his bull Nandi, and relics such as a gold Rhyton with Dionysus head has been found at a Scythian tomb, as well as other Dionysian relics.

A number of ancient sources recorded the widespread belief of their time, that the god worshiped by the Jewish people, Yah-Labeo, and Plutarch all either made this association, or discussed it as an extant belief. The Jewish Encyclopedia makes it clear that at times, and likely under force, many of the Jews did in fact worship Dionysus, particularly during the time of the Maccabees. As noted in the 1906 edition of The Jewish Encyclopedia: The general statement in I Maccabees (i. 51, 54, 55) that Antiochus Epiphanes forced the Jews to sacrifice in the Greek fashion, is amplified in II Maccabees (vi. 7; compare III Macc. ii. 29) into the statement that the Jews were forced to take part in the festivals of Dionysus and to deck themselves with ivy (κίσσος); hence Hippolytus (“De Antichristo,” pp. 33-35, § 49), a Church father of the second century, regards Antiochus Epiphanes as the prototype of Antichrist… the Dionysia were celebrated in every country that had come under the influence of Greek culture. Antiochus XI even bore the by-name “Dionysus” ( Josephus, “Ant.” xiii. 15, § 1; “B. J.” i. 4, § 7); and Nicanor, the general of Demetrius, threatened to consecrate a Temple at Jerusalem to Dionysus unless Judas Maccabeus was delivered to him (II Macc. xiv. 33). A myth of Dionysus is connected with the Palestinian city of Scythopolis. Pliny (“Historia Naturalis,” v. 18, § 74) and Solinus (ed. Mommsen, ch. 36) derive the name of this city from the Scythians, who were settled on that spot by Dionysus in order to protect the tomb of his nurse who was buried there. The Greeks and the Romans were firmly convinced that the Jews had a cult of Dionysus, basing this opinion on some external point of similarity. Plutarch thinks that the name of the Jewish Sabbath is derived from σα̇βσζ , the cry of the ecstatic Bacchantes. More important still is his further statement that the Jewish Feast of Tabernacles, as celebrated in the Temple at Jerusalem, was really a form of Dionysus worship. He reasons as follows: “The Jews celebrate their most important feast in the time of the vintage; they heap all sorts of fruit on their tables, and they live in tents and huts made chiefly from branches of the vine and from ivy; the first day of this festival they call the Feast of Tabernacles. A few days later they celebrate another feast, invoking Bacchus no longer", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634243995_cleaned.txt:257:65b64148fd19", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 2207, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634243995_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634243995", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634243995_cleaned", "chunk_index": 258, "text": "celebrated in the Temple at Jerusalem, was really a form of Dionysus worship.

A few days later they celebrate another feast, invoking Bacchus no longer through symbols, but calling upon him directly by name. They, furthermore, have a festival during which they carry branches of the fig-tree and the thyrsus; they enter the Temple, where they probably celebrate Bacchanalia, for they use small trumpets; and some among them, the Levites, play on the cythara” (“Symposium,” iv. 5, $3 ). Plutarch evidently had certain ceremonies of the Feast of Sukkot in mind. See Crown in Post-biblical Times. The accusation of Tacitus (“Hist.” v. 5) is similar: As their priests sing to the accompaniment of flutes and kettle-drums, and as they deck themselves with laurel, and as a golden vine was found in their Temple, many people believe that they worship Bacchus, the conqueror of the East; but the two cults have nothing in common, for Bacchus has established a brilliant and joyous ritual, while the customs of the Jews are bizarre and morose.” Plutarch, furthermore, deduces the Jewish worship of Bacchus from the garment of the high priest, who wears bells on his mantle, like those that were used in the Bacchanalia at night; he refers also in ambiguous terms to a thyrsus and to drums (τνμπανα) which the high priest wears in front (on the frontlet or on the breastplate?) (ib.). Grätz (“Gesch.” 2d ed., ii. 254) assumes a barrel-opening festival (πιθογία = “vinalia”), which, however, can not be substantiated. In describing the garment of the high priest, Plutarch purposely uses expressions reminiscent of the Dionysus worship, and it is probable that just such equivocal expressions, which he may have read in a Hellenistic work, led him to make the impossible assertion that the Jews had a cult of Dionysus. As a matter of fact the palm-branch prescribed for the Feast of Tabernacles was called by the Hellenists θύρσος ( Josephus, “Ant.” xiii. 13, § 5; II Macc. x. 7), which could easily remind a Greek of the Dionysia. He also intimates that he knew something about the “Feast of the Drawing of Water,” which in its free joyousness resembled the Bacchanalia (Suk. v. 2; Tosef.: iv. 1-5; Bab. 51b; Yer. 55b). Neither the statements of Tacitus nor those of Plutarch lead to the conclusion, as some scholars assert, that they used as their sources anti-Jewish Alexandrian works, for their statements contain nothing that is hostile to the Jews.

A Greek, on the contrary, would consider it a vindication for the Jews if he could derive ceremonies of the Jewish worship from pagan practices. (Gottheil & Krauss, 1906) A 4th century BC, coin on exhibit in the British Museum. Labeled either “YHW” (Yahu) or “YHD” ( Judea), and thought to be the only physical representation of Yahweh from ancient Israel, has been connected with Dionysus. Stephen Herbert Langdon, an American-born British Assyriologist, wrote in his Mythology of All Races – Semitic (1931) explains: A coin from Gaza in Southern Philista, fourth century BC, the period of the Jewish subjection to the last of the Persian kings, has the only known representation of this Hebrew deity. The letters YHW are incised just above the hawk(?) which the god holds in his outstretched left hand. He wears a himation, leaving the upper part of the body bare, and sits upon a winged wheel. The right arm is wrapped in his garment. At his feet is a mask. Because of the winged chariot and mask it has been suggested that Yaw had been identified with Dionysus on account of a somewhat similar drawing of the Greek deity on a vase where he rides in a chariot drawn by a satyr (Langdon, 1931). Left: This 4th century BCE coin, 4th century BC, on exhibit in the British Museum. The coin shows a seated figure, labeled either “YHW” (Yahu) or Ω^(′′)YHD^(′′) (Judea), which is thought by some to be the only physical representation of the Jewish God, and it has been connected with Dionysus. Right: Two sides of a coin that seems to connect the God of the Jews with Dionysus, dated to 55 BC depicts a kneeling king with the inscription “Bacchus Judaeus” (BACCHIVS IVDAEVS). In the period between the two revolts of the Jews of Palestine against Roman rule some non-Jews sought to identify the God of the Jews with their own god of wine, Dionysus or Liber. The actual evidence suggests three things. The cult of the Temple at Jerusalem was seen by outsiders to be characterized by an association with, and the use of, wine, an impression Jews did nothing to counteract. Second, outsiders acted on this impression, both as part of the cognitive step of identifying the God of the Jews with Dionysus, and, possibly, making gifts to the Temple, while it stood, of wine-related dedications. Third, this was a characterization Jews were willing to embrace themselves, even at times of revolt (Kirkpatrick, 2013).

Third, this was a characterization Jews were willing to embrace themselves, even at times of revolt (Kirkpatrick, 2013). The Immortality Key has recently suggested that Jesus was influenced by Dionysian rites that involved infused wines, and made much of the Dionysus worship in the ancient Israeli city of Scythopolis, as a potential connection point. Muraresku is not alone here; a number of scholars have made similar suggestions. Notably, in an article titled “The Wine God in Palestine,” Professor Morton Smith, who was an American professor of ancient history at Columbia University, offered considerable evidence for the influence of Dionysiac cult and myth on Jewish and early Christian material. This connection, and the use of infused wines in early Christianity, is also something I have discussed in earlier works (Bennett & McQueen, 2001; Bennett 2010; 2018) and something I hope to examine more closely in a future work. It was in the period of Greek domination that cannabis seems to have disappeared from the script completely. The Hebrew Tanach, was translated into the Greek Septuagint, in the 3rd century BCE, allegedly by 70 Jewish translators who miraculously all provided identical translations. However, they apparently all made the same errors and mistranslations as well! As Professor Stephen Vicchio has explained, it did not take long for Greek translations to become “suspect in the eyes of devout and scholarly Jews, many of who still spoke and wrote in the ancient Hebrew. The controversy became more heated when Jewish scholars pointed out a number of mistranslations and additions to the Hebrew text made by the Greek translators” (Vicchio, 2006). It is at this juncture that kaneh bosm, became “calamus” a common marsh root, in the Greek texts, which for reasons already discussed, is easily discounted as kaneh bosm. Whether intentional, or a simple mistranslation, is hard to know. Regardless of this Greek designation, with Hebrew authorities, the botanical identity of kaneh bosm also seems to have been lost, and a variety of candidates have been suggested since then, as we have discussed in Chapter 3. For the many reasons we have looked at in detail in this volume, I think we can see what was once lost, has now been found, and the identity of kaneh bosm as cannabis is now ensured. I suspect it was at this point when cannabis itself went out of vogue, after the installation of the Second Temple. I suspect this due to the total lack of prophetic messages in that period.

A strong indication that the religion had removed itself from its entheogenic and shamanic roots, and became a dogmatic orthodox religion of repeated rituals, implemented rules of life, and importantly – offerings of tithes. I think the actual nail in the coffin for the end of entheogenic cannabis here, may be found in what is likely one of the last texts composed in the Hebrew Bible. A later myth which was ironically placed at the beginning of the Bible, depicting Creation, and serving as a cultural template for humanity from there forward. Arguably, the Eden myth is the most potent myth in history, it defined the roles of men and women for millennia and served as a tool for cultural programming with its inherent built-in fears of “knowledge,” and all too heavy burden of “Original Sin.” Oddly these elements seem to be more present in Christianity, than Judaism. Many Christians literally believe this is the story of Humanity’s creation, despite the outstanding fossil and geological records for the path of evolution and age of the planet. Truly, the fear of knowledge has been ever present. When the Eden account was written is a subject of heated debate. Many scholars see Genesis as composed during the Hellenistic period, which would place it in the first decades of the 4th century BCE. Others place it in the exilic pre-Persian period (the 6th century BCE) due to the noted Babylonian influence on the myth. Whereas the Fundamentalist view traces it back to the beginning of time, seen as a short 6,000 years ago, later to be recorded and written down at the time of Moses, who was said to have received the story directly from the source. There are considerably few references to the Eden account outside of the fable itself in the Bible. Most prominently we see this come up in Ezekiel, which places it at the time of the Babylonian captivity. This could well account for the borrowed elements of mythology in both the story of Adam and Eve, and the equally mythical tale of Noah’s Ark, which have their origin in much earlier Near Eastern tales. The Prophet Joel makes a brief comparison to the garden of Eden in reference to a fiery judgment coming to the Jews via The “Day of the Lord”: “Before them fire devours, behind them a flame blazes.

Before them the land is like the garden of Eden, behind them, a desert waste – nothing escapes them” ( Joel 2:3). Although the fundamental view is that Joel was a 9th century BCE prophet, most scholars suggest the text was not composed till the 5th or 4th century BCE. In Isaiah 51:3, the Lord restores the land to look like Eden: “The LORD will surely comfort Zion and will look with compassion on all her ruins; he will make her deserts like Eden, her wastelands like the garden of the LORD.” Here again, it has long been noted that the books of Isaiah were reworked by later authors, extending past Deuteronomic editions and into Priestly editions. The 8th century BCE prophet Hosea makes reference to Adam’s sin in comparison with that of the Hebrews: “But like Adam they have transgressed the covenant; There they have dealt treacherously against Me” (Hosea 6:7). However, like many other texts of the Hebrew Bible, there is little consensus as to which parts can be attributed to Hosea, and which are the works of later authors and editors. In Hosea and Amos Believers Church Bible Commentary, Allen R. Guenther explains: “The book has been shaped by later editors to affirm that although Israel’s deep unfaithfulness brought harsh judgment, God’s final purpose for Israel is deliverance and healing” (Guenther 1998). The comparison to Adam’s “sin” and the transgressions of the Hebrews, fits well within that scope.1 None of these references indicate that the Eden Myth was composed prior to the Babylonian Exile. This later date accounts for the adoption of so much earlier Babylonian and Near Eastern mythical motifs. It is now well accepted that the Eden myth borrowed heavily from earlier myths that predate the Bible by millennia, although the Biblical account is not without its own original take. As we shall see, hidden in plain sight in the Eden myth, there are reversals of the earlier polytheistic pantheon which were directed at demonizing key elements of pre-monotheistic religious beliefs and practices. Before looking at these various elements that went into the myth’s creation, it’s worth looking at the myth itself. Many religious users of plant hallucinogens have pointed to God’s promise in Genesis 1, “I give you every seed-bearing en right to use marijuana and other psycho-active plants.

Unfortunately, we only need go as far as Genesis 2, and the story of prohibition in the Garden of Eden, for God’s commandments in Genesis 1 to have this promise contradicted, in what has been described “as the first drug bust.” The Biblical myth, as told in Genesis 2 & 3, has it that after creating the earth and the heavens, God realized that there was “no man to work the ground,” so he made Adam the first man to do just that. After creating Adam to till the soil, God placed him in a garden he had planted in the east: “And the Lord God made all kinds of trees grow out of the ground – trees that were pleasing to the eye and good for food. In the middle of the garden were the tree of life and the tree of knowledge of good and evil” (Genesis 2:8-9) The Lord God took the man and put him in the garden of Eden to work it and take care of it. And the Lord God commanded the man, “You are free to eat from any tree in the garden; but you must not eat from the tree of knowledge of good and evil, for when you eat of it you will surely die” (Genesis 2:15-17). Shortly after God created man and the garden for him to work in, he realized “It was not good for the man to be alone.”2 So he put Adam into a deep sleep, took out his rib, and made the first woman. It was around then that the patriarchal writers of the Biblical tale have it that the trouble started… When the woman saw that the fruit of the tree was good for food and pleasing to the eye, and also desirable for gaining wisdom, she took some and ate it. She also gave some to her husband, who was with her, and he ate it. Then the eyes of both of them were opened, and they realized that they were naked; so they sewed fig leaves together and made coverings for themselves. Cursed is the ground because of you; through painful toil you will eat of it all the days of your life. It will produce thorns and thistles for you, and you will eat the plants of the field.

The Lord God made garments of skin for Adam and his wife and clothed them. And the Lord God said, “The man has now become as one of us, knowing good and evil. He must not be allowed to reach out his hand and take also from the tree of life and eat, and live for ever.” So the Lord God banished him from the Garden of Eden to work the ground from which he had been taken. After he drove the man out, he placed on the east side of the Garden of Eden cherubim and a flaming sword flashing back and forth to guard the way of the tree of life (Genesis 3:21-24). Mircea Eliade, the noted Romanian historian of religion, phi-losopher, and professor at the University of Chicago, pointed motif; that of the naked goddess, the miraculous tree, and its serpent guardian. But here, rather than a hero who overcomes and gains a share in the symbol of life, the Genesis story “gives us Adam, an ingenious victim of the serpent’s perfidy. In short we are dealing with a failed ‘immortalization,’ like that of Gilgamesh. For, once omniscient, equal to the ‘gods’, Adam could discover the Tree of Life (of which Yahweh had not spoken to him) and become immortal. The text is clear and categorical: ‘Yahweh God said, see, the man has become like one of us, with knowledge of good and evil. He must not be allowed to stretch out his hand and pick from the tree of life also and eat some and live forever.’ And God banished the couple from paradise and condemned them to work for a living” (Eliade 1978). In the ancient world, the serpent was an image of both knowledge and healing and as the respected scholar Merlin Stone has suggested, likely also of divine intoxication (Stone 1976) thus its connection with sacred plants. As early as 2025 BCE, in ancient Sumeria the serpent, under the name Ningizzidia, was known as the “Lord of the Tree of Truth” (Campbell 1964). Moreover, the brazen serpent had once sat in the Holy of Holies, and was removed during the reforms of Josiah, because the people of Israel burned incense to it. Curiously, in later times Jesus would compare himself to this same serpent ( John 3:14).

[In] the scenario … of the naked goddess and the miraculous tree … we can see that the serpent of Genesis succeeded, all things considered, in its role as guardian of a symbol of life and youth. But this archaic myth was radically altered by the author of the biblical accounts. Adam’s … disobedience betrayed his Luciferian pride, the desire to be like God. It was the greatest sin that the creature could commit against his creator. It was the “original sin,” a notion pregnant with consequences for the Hebrew and Christian theologies. Such a vision of the “fall” could command recognition only in a religion centered on the omnipotence and jealousy of God. As it has been handed down to us, the biblical narrative indicates the increasing authority of Yahwistic monotheism.… The first sin not only brought about the loss of paradise and the transformation of the human condition; it became in some sense the source of all the evils that burdened humanity (Eliade 1978). By the way it conflicts with basic common sense the “psyche knows unconsciously that the [Eden] story is dangerously upsetting. It creates a religious taboo to protect itself. The teaching that results from … [its general interpretation] is that mankind must remain in an infantile state and obey those who speak in the name of the ‘father’ located in heaven. The dogma of original sin as disobedience is maintained to prevent disconcerting discoveries concerning that deity” (Suares 1992). Not surprisingly, in light of the original sin mythology, the acceptance of the Bible as the basis for a “world religion,” through Since its very inception, the Bible has not been about “new ideas,” but maintaining “old ones” which are compounded out of ancient and outdated tribal rules and belief systems. This prohibition of knowledge also claims dominion over the plant world, and the revelations that the ingestion of certain herbs could provide; such prohibitions date back to the very beginnings of the Bible itself. Eden as a tool of propaganda, extends to our own time, and it’s by no chance an accident that in the era of cannabis prohibition, the forces behind “reefer madness” deemed the herb a “devil’s weed” spread by “Vipers” like the serpent of Eden, identified by the hiss they would make inhaling their pernicious demonic drug!

This struggle has lasted down to our present era, leading to the near death of shamanism, a religion distinguished preeminently by the ritual ingestion of powerful plant sacraments for revelation, and which has disappeared whenever it has been brought into contact with Christianity. A religion based on long past history and controlling people through ancient tribal rules has absolutely no room for the new revelations experienced by entheogeningesting shamans. The idea that the Biblical myth of Eden and its Tree of Knowledge, identifies a prohibited psychoactive is considerably widespread. One could argue, it was an imperative aspect of the myth, from its creation – intuitively, anyone familiar with psychoactive substances could perceive it in the metaphor. Historically, the view that the forbidden fruit of Eden was some sort of psychoactive substance, outside of the indications laden in the story itself, does go back considerably far in time. A Curious Myth. We may close this chapter with a fitting historical reference to the fungi, relating to a curious myth, connecting them with our reputed ancestors, Adam and Eve. This is seen in a fresco in a ruined chapel at Plaincourault, in France, dating back to 1291, and purporting to depict the fall of man. A reproduction of this is shown,1 and the Tree of Life is represented as a branching Amanita muscaria, with the Serpent twining himself in its “branches,” while Eve, having eaten of the forbidden fruit, appears from her attitude to be in some doubt as to its after effects, which it is gratifying to know caused her no serious harm. It is impossible to say whether this picture is merely a quaint conception on the part of the artist, or whether it has any better traditional foundation (Rolfe & Rolfe, 1925). The plant in this fresco has nothing whatever to do with mushrooms … and the similarity with Amanita muscaria is purely fortuitous. The Plaincourault fresco is only one example – and, since the style is provincial, a particularly deceptive one – of a conventionalized tree type, prevalent in Romanesque and early Gothic art, which art historians actually refer to as a ‘mushroom tree” or in German, Pilzbaum. It comes about by the gradual schematization of the impressionistically rendered Italian pine tree in Roman and early Christian painting, and there are hundreds of instances exemplifying this development – unknown of course to mycologists.… What the mycologists have overlooked is that the medieval artists hardly ever worked from nature but", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634243995_cleaned.txt:266:d9507ec4681d", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 2216, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634243995_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634243995", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634243995_cleaned", "chunk_index": 267, "text": "deceptive one – of a conventionalized tree type, prevalent in Romanesque and early Gothic art, which art historians actually refer to as a ‘mushroom tree” or in German, Pilzbaum.

Wasson’s correspondence with another art historian, Meyer Schapiro, corroborated this view. In Soma: Divine Mushroom of Immortality, Wasson noted these criticisms and further explained: “The misinterpretation … of the Plaincourault fresco” could “be traced to the recent dissemination in Europe of reports of the Siberian use of the fly-agaric,” i.e. In this time period, there were numerous accounts of the fly agarics use by Siberian Shaman, and this colored the interpretation of the Plaincourault fresco. Wasson further noted in regard to the Creation myth, “the commentators have made an error in timing: the span of the past is longer … and the events that they seek to confirm took place before recorded history began” (Wasson, 1968). Some months ago I read the Garden of Eden tale once more, after not having thought of it since childhood. I read it as one who now knew the entheogens. Right away it came over me that the Tree of Knowledge was the tree that has been revered by many tribes of Early Man in Eurasia precisely because there grows under it the mushroom, splendid to look upon, that supplies the entheogenic food to which Early Man attributed miraculous powers. He who composed the tale for us in Genesis was clearly steeped in the lore of this entheogen: he refrained from identifying the “fruit”: he was writing for the initiates who would recognize what he was speaking about. I was an initiate. Strangers and also the unworthy would remain in the dark. Adam and Eve had eaten the “fruit,” what the mycologists call Amanita muscaria, what the initiates call by a variety of euphemisms, which change from time to time, and we have seen to what strange lengths the uninitiated go when these euphemisms are detached from the “fruit” that they represent. The priestly redactor who set down the Genesis tale, an initiate and a believer, attributed to the “fruit” the gift of self-consciousness, a remarkable observation because self-consciousness is one of the major traits that distinguish humankind from all other creatures. Is it not surprising that the composer of the story gave credit for this particular gift to our mushroom? It is unlikely that he was alone in doing so (Wasson, 1986).

Is it not surprising that the composer of the story gave credit for this particular gift to our mushroom? It is unlikely that he was alone in doing so (Wasson, 1986). Wasson further identified the Tree of Knowledge with the Vedic Soma: ““I hold that the fruit of the Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil was Soma, was the kakuljd, was Amanita muscaria, was the Nameless Mushroom of the English-speaking people. The Tree was probably a conifer, in Mesopotamia. The serpent, being underground, was the faithful attendant on the fruit” (Wasson, 1986). Although I think Wasson is onto something in connecting the Biblical tree with Soma, his suggestion here of Amanita muscaria, as that tree is presented here with weaker evidence than that which he used to make his case for Soma as the fly agaric. I have detailed the many issues with Wasson’s claims about the Fly Agaric mushroom as Soma, from myself and many other researchers, at great length in Cannabis and the Soma Solution (2010). Here in his claims about the Eden mythos, he makes no real attempt to document a knowledge of the Agaric with the ancient Hebrews, but still claims initiates of its use in the “Priestly redactor.” The prime example of the relation between the serpent and the mushroom is, of course, in the Garden of Eden story of the Old Testament. The cunning reptile prevails upon Eve and her husband to eat of the tree, whose fruit “made them as gods, knowing good and evil” (Gen 3:4). The whole Eden story is mushroom-based mythology, not least in the identity of the “tree” as the sacred fungus.… Even as late as the thirteenth-century some recollection of the old tradition was known among Christians, to judge from a fresco painted on the wall of a ruined church in Plaincourault in France (pl. 2). There the Amanita muscaria is gloriously portrayed, entwined with a serpent, whilst Eve stands by holding her belly (Allegro, 1970). That, and a footnote mentioning Wasson’s dismissal of the connection, is all Allegro says on the matter. The mass of the rest of Allegro’s book focuses on his preposterous etymological and linguistic theories, regarding Jesus being a symbol for the mushroom, and other hokum. Nonetheless, since then, the idea that the Plaincourault Fresco represents the fly agaric mushroom has persisted, and this view has been spread widely by numerous authors writing about psychoactive mushrooms. More recently, a professor of anthropology, Jerry Brown and his wife Judy, have made the preposterous and unsubstantiated claim that Wasson was motivated by his banking relationship with the Catholic Church,", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634243995_cleaned.txt:268:c89ec628876d", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 2218, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634243995_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634243995", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634243995_cleaned", "chunk_index": 269, "text": "focuses on his preposterous etymological and linguistic theories, regarding Jesus being a symbol for the mushroom, and other hokum.

More recently, a professor of anthropology, Jerry Brown and his wife Judy, have made the preposterous and unsubstantiated claim that Wasson was motivated by his banking relationship with the Catholic Church, to obscure the connection between the fly agaric mushroom and the tree of knowledge as depicted in the Plaincourault Fresco. In their 2016 book, The Psychedelic Gospels: The Secret History of Hallucinogens in Christianity the Browns claim: …The unmasking of the Wasson-Vatican connection calls into question everything Wasson ever wrote to justify his position on the absence of entheogens in the Judeo-Christian tradition after 1000 BCE, including his ardent refusal to publicly acknowledge that the “mushroom-tree” in the Eden fresco at Plaincourault is indeed an Amanita muscaria. It was this refusal that provided the motivation for Wasson’s insidious personal attacks on Allegro, the scholar of the Dead Sea Scrolls who expanded the theory on the role of entheogens in religion to encompass the origins of Christianity (Brown & Brown, 2016). What makes this statement curious is that the Browns actually reject the linguistic aspects of Allegro’s theory, and only embrace the image-based evidence of the Plaincourault Fresco: “our theory differs from Allegro’s … while Allegro bases his theory on the speculative interpretation of ancient languages, we base our theory on the plausible identification of entheogenic images” (Brown, 2016). However, interpretative claims of entheogens perceived in medieval images are all the Browns are left with for evidence. The Browns offer little in the way of ancient evidence of the use of psychedelic mushrooms, and almost solely rely on imagery, with the Plaincourault fresco taking a prominent role. Elina Gertsman, an art historian at Case Western Reserve University, says she’s not one to shy away from well-placed speculation, but even she can’t get behind the idea that the tree is a hallucinogenic mushroom. Instead, she says, medieval artists may have been experimenting with new ways to stylize trees. There are countless examples of medieval images where artists did this, including lions that appear to be wearing glasses, or elephants with mitten-like feet. “I think you will be hardpressed to find a specialist in medieval art who disagrees with me and subscribes, instead, to the psychedelic Christianity idea,” Gertsman says.3 As with earlier art critics, my view is that the image in the Fresco is a poorly drawn tree. Unlike a mushroom, it has branches, even three going up to the top portion of the tree, and the serpent holding the traditional apple is woven between then, which would rule out the single stem of a mushroom. Although there are dots on the", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634243995_cleaned.txt:269:3348994bf12c", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 2219, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634243995_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634243995", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634243995_cleaned", "chunk_index": 270, "text": "in medieval art who disagrees with me and subscribes, instead, to the psychedelic Christianity idea,” Gertsman says.3 As with earlier art critics, my view is that the image in the Fresco is a poorly drawn tree.

Although there are dots on the image, as with the white dots of the amanita muscaria, unlike the mushroom, where the white dots appear sporadically, on the tree these are structured neatly in rows, and there are lines indicating overlapping layers of growth. There is also an apple depicted on the right in the serpent’s mouth. The Door of SalvationThe Garden of Eden’s forbidden trees come up again, when the lic Bishop Bernward, known as “The Door of Salvation.” The Browns claim, this and other pieces created at the behest of Bernward, which sit in St. Michael’s Church in Hildesheim, Germany, represent “an entheogenic legacy that was deliberately created by a saint of the Catholic Church.” However, as we will see, the Browns’ interpretation of the Eden mythos as depicted on “The Door of Salvation,” is something of a misrepresentation that leaves out part of the sequence, perhaps even intellectually dishonest in this respect. However they are not the only ones to have done this in regard to this specific relic. In casting the door, Bernward took special care to precisely identify the species of psychoactive mushroom in his bronze bas-relief. As ethno-botanist Giorgio Samorini observes, “The mushroom-tree is realistically rendered with a precision not far short of anatomical accuracy and can be identified as one of the most common Germanic and European psilocybian mushroom, P. semilanceata.” Botanically speaking, the mushroom-tree between Adam and Eve sprouts two bell-shaped mushrooms with pointed, nipple-like tops (papillae) and furrowed (striated) caps (Brown & Brown, 2016). The Browns refer to Giorgio Samorini, a widely respected Italian ethnobotanist, who as far as I know was the first to make this suggestion about this image, although like the Plaincourault fresco, the connection to mushrooms in the imagery has been widely embraced, albeit here with the suggestion of a different mushroom species. An interesting interpretation if that is all there was to it, however, the Browns, and others who have written about this panel on “The Door of Salvation” with similar claims, leave out the proceeding panel, which is clearly depicting the ingestion of the forbidden fruit, and instead use the panel that follows that one, which shows them covering themselves in fig leaves. The panel with the fig leaves is in fact the panel being used for the suggestion of mushroom imagery, and this panel actually depicts Eve using the same leafy material that is on the tips of the branches which", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634243995_cleaned.txt:270:b216dfffdd83", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 2220, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634243995_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634243995", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634243995_cleaned", "chunk_index": 271, "text": "panel on “The Door of Salvation” with similar claims, leave out the proceeding panel, which is clearly depicting the ingestion of the forbidden fruit, and instead use the panel that follows that one, which shows them covering themselves in fig leaves. The panel with the fig leaves is in fact the panel being used for the suggestion of mushroom imagery, and this panel actually depicts Eve using the same leafy material that is on the tips of the branches which are being interpreted as “mushrooms” to cover herself. Clearly the proceeding panel, with the classic forbidden apples is depicting the ingestion of the forbidden fruit. The panel being used by the Browns and others for the mushroom-like imagery of the trees, is in no way connected to the forbidden tree of knowledge, but is instead a tree from which “fig leaves” were broken off and Adam and Eve covered themselves: “and they knew that they were naked; so they sewed together fig leaves and made coverings for themselves.” As the Browns took the trouble to visit St. Michaels in person, I think it remains without question, that they intentionally left out this panel which shows the forbidden tree as the classic apple tree, and the actual ingestion of the forbidden fruit by Adam and Eve. There is no indication the mushroom-like trees are connected besides serving as a source of “fig leaves” for their covering. Many European medieval artists never actually saw the plants or animals from other lands they depicted from written descriptions or other illustrations, and as we all know from the childhood game of passing a whisper from one ear to another down a line, what you start with and what you end up with can really change as it goes down the line, into something very different from the original. I think this is the case many times in regard to things like the Palm Tree, as depicted in medieval European art as well. Even with the clear archaeological evidence in the Holy Land for cannabis as a ritual incense in an 8th century BCE Jewish temple, and the 4th century CE use both topically and as an incense for medical purposes from Bet Shemesh Israel, I think it would be hard to argue for these practices to have been secretly passed down to the medieval artist who painted these images. In the case of the mushroom claims, these are made solely on interpretations of medieval art, with no corroborating evidence that humanity in Europe were even aware of many of the mushroom species suggested, let alone their ingestion, and no textual evidence from the time indicating the use of some sort of secret sacrament. I prefer things like actual textual references, etymological research and most of all archaeological evidence as the basis for my own work.

None of this is offered in way of substantiating the fly agaric or any other mushroom species as the forbidden Tree of Eden. Still, the idea is popular, largely, I would argue, due its simplistic appeal. Anyone can see the shape of a mushroom in the Plaincourault fresco, and it is this meme-like quality and instant appeal, that does not take any serious research or backing, that is largely responsible for the success of the claim. Now this does not disregard the sacred mushroom, or the contributions of R Gordon Wasson. Clearly, the mushroom was a known entheogenic sacrament in the New World, both prior to and after the arrival of Columbus, and this was largely repressed by Catholic forces. I admire Wasson’s efforts detailing the use of mushrooms, with both contemporary written accounts and identifying mushrooms in statues and other imagery left over from the pre-Columbian era. I just don’t think anyone has produced convincing evidence that the ancient Hebrews or Christians knew of or used psychoactive mushrooms. The Physiologus, a collection of documents originally written in Greek and Armenian that go back to the second or third century, and were later translated into Latin around the 11th century, makes reference to the mandrake, in a tale of Adam and Eve and metaphorical Elephants. In Goddesses, Elixirs, and Witches, John Riddle suggests the author may have been a “Hellenistic Jew … considering the biblical quotations and allusions, but the version we have is clearly Christianized. If it existed in Hebrew, we have no copy…. Max Wellman [(1930)] believed that the mandrake-Garden of Eden story goes back to an unidentified Jewish source” (Riddle, 2010). …Adam and Eve. For when they were pleasing to God, before the provocation in the flesh, they knew nothing about copulation nor had they knowledge of sin. When, however, they knew the wife ate of the Tree of Knowledge, which the Mandragora means, and gave of the fruits to her man, she was immediately made wanderer and they had to clear out of Paradise on account of it. For, all the time that they were in Paradise, Adam did not know her. But then, the Scriptures say: “Adam went in to his wife and she conceived and bore Cain, upon the waters of tribulation (The Aberdeen Beastery: Folio 10r).

The botanical identity of duda’im is quite difficult to ascertain. The accepted opinion, however, is that it is a plant that grows, blossoms, or ripens “in the days of the wheat harvest” (Bereshit 30:14). Most biblical commentaries translate duda’im as mandrakes. Rashi writes that the duda’im are a type of plant that the Arabs call yasmin, which is translated in English as the mandrake. Ibn Ezra asserts that duda’im have a good aroma, as it is written in Shir HaShirim (7:14), “duda’im give forth fragrance.” They resemble the human form for they have the likeness of a head and hands… …Rabbi Dr. Joseph H. Hertz, the former Chief Rabbi of the United Kingdom and Commonwealth, quotes the 1611 King James’ authorized version of the Bible where the word duda’im is translated as “love apples.” Hertz explains that the fruit is the size of a large plum, quite round, yellow, and full of soft pulp. The fruit is still considered in the East as a love charm… (Solodokin, 2010). According to renowned botanist Professor Richard Evans Schultes, and the scientist Albert Hoffmann, noted for his creation of LSD: “Early Christians believed that the mandrake root [which like ginseng sometimes appears in a humanoid form] was originally created by God as an experiment before he created man in the Garden of Eden” (Schultes & Hofmann 1979\\1992). William Menzies Alexander, in his Demonic Possession in the New Testament: Its Historical, Medical, and Theological Aspects, also refers to the use of mandrake in the early Christian period, commenting that “The sole value of the plant depended on its anti-demonic properties”(Alexander 1902\\1980). Indications of the myths of Genesis, in earlier Mesopotamian mythologies, have long been noted. Notably, there is an earlier Mesopotamian myth of the flood (c.1750 B.C.), from which the “deluge tale … has come down to us in the Book of Genesis” (Campbell 1962). Comparatively, the Mesopotamian myth has it that four gods (Anu, Enlil, Ninurta and Ennugi), had grown tired of mankind and at the instigation of the “unreasoning” Enlil, they decided to destroy them with a flood. A fifth God, the beneficent “instructor” god Enki revealed the plot to a man named Ut-napishtim, the Mesopotamian Noah, and helped him plan his escape.

As the ancient myth states; “Who other than Enki, can devise plans? It is Enki alone who knows every matter.” Like Noah following God’s commandments, Utnapishtim built the boat according to the precise measurements Enki had given him. He stored the ship with provisions of all kinds and placed his family and some wild animals in it. Then there came a terrifying storm, with a flood that lasted for seven days and seven nights. As with the later Biblical tale, when it was over and the boat came to rest on a mountain, Utnapishtim sent out first a dove, then a swallow and then a raven. The first two returned to him, but the raven did not, which showed him the water had subsided. Utnapishtim made a sacrifice, to which he invited all the gods except Enlil, who was principally responsible for sending the flood. The general view is that Utnapishtim, or alternatively, Uta-na’ishtim, became Noah, a conceivable abbreviation of (Uta)-na’ish(tim), when the myth reached Palestine. As Helmer Ringgren explained in Religions of the Ancient Near East: “The similarity to the biblical account is obvious: the place where the ship stops, the number of birds that are sent out, and the sacrifice after the flood are the same” (Ringgren 1973). In regard to the Eden mythos, similarities have been noted between the much more ancient Tale of Adapa, who was tricked out of the bread of life and immortality by the crafty god Enki and the later Genesis story of Adam and Eve’s deception regarding the supposedly death-dealing fruit of the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil. The story of Adapa is likely “related to the biblical Adam”(Saggs 1962) and “may be regarded as a myth about the first man” (Hooke 1963). As the Jewish historian Raphael Patai, and English mythologist and poet Robert Graves noted in The Hebrew Myths: The Book of Genesis: “Another source of the Genesis Fall of Man is the Akkadian myth of Adapa.… This myth supplies the theme of the Serpent’s warning to Eve, that God had deceived her about the properties of the forbidden fruit” (Graves and Patai, 1963). Religious scholar John Gray commented upon the Sumerian pantheon’s chief god, Anu’s resentment of Ea’s5 giving the knowledge of the god’s to a mere human, Adapa, as being “strongly reminiscent of the divine resentment at Adam for presuming to eat of the tree of knowledge of good and evil” (Gray 1969). Enki, also known as Ea, was a mischievous god of wisdom, magic and incantations who resided in the ocean under the earth.

Enki, also known as Ea, was a mischievous god of wisdom, magic and incantations who resided in the ocean under the earth. Although often depicted as a bearded god, with a goat at his feet, and rivers with fish emanating from him, the “god Enki is related to snakes in Early Dynastic incantations” (Espak, 2015). He was later known as Ea in the Akkadian (Assyrian-Babylonian) religion. Some sources see the Babylonian Oannes as identical with this god, or as an emissary, although there is debate on the matter.6 It has long been noted that the features of Enki’s idealistic homeland Dilmun “may underlie the Hebrew accounts of Paradise” (Hooke 1963). Reminiscent of the serpent’s role in the Garden of Eden story, the myth of Dilmun records how the goddess Ninhursag “makes eight plants spring up … in spite of a prohibition Enki eats all eight of them.… There are obviously certain similarities between this myth and the biblical picture of paradise … the eating of the forbidden plants is distantly reminiscent of the tree of knowledge in the garden of Eden” (Rinngren 1973). Enki has connections with a sacred tree similar to that which is described in the Garden of Eden. In the ancient Sumerian texts, Ea Enkiis described as being wise and as he “who knows the plant of life and the water of life” (Ringgren 1973). Professor Mackenzie also noted this in 1915, commenting that “In a fragmentary Babylonian charm there is a reference to a sacred tree or bush at Eridu [Eridu is thought to be the cradle of Sumerian civilization]. Professor Sayce has suggested that it is the Biblical ‘Tree of Life’ in the Garden of Eden.… It may be that Ea’s sacred bush or tree is a survival of tree and water worship” (Mackenzie 1915): Even more controversial are noted connections between, Dagon, Ea and Yahweh. The Mesopotamian name ‘Yah-Daganu’ has been translated as ‘Yahweh is Dagon’. In Mythology of the Babylonian People, Donald Mackenzie explained: “Ea whose name is also rendered Aa, was identified with Ya, Ya’u or Au, the Jah of the Hebrews. ‘In Ya-Daguna, Jah is Dagon’, writes Professor Pinches, ‘we have the elements reversed, showing a wish to identify Jah with Dagon, rather than Dagon with Jah; whilst another interesting name, Au-Aa, shows an identification of Jah with Aa, two names which have every appearance of being etymologically connected.” Jah’s name is one of the names for “god’”in the Assyro-Babylonian language. (Mackenzie 1915) As well, at excavations of Ebla, which we looked at earlier for evidence of the ritual use of psychoactive substances, researchers found indications that sometime after the reign of Sargon (died, 2279 BCE) the chief deity", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634243995_cleaned.txt:275:c69e8901c8cc", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 2225, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634243995_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634243995", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634243995_cleaned", "chunk_index": 276, "text": "Jah with Dagon, rather than Dagon with Jah; whilst another interesting name, Au-Aa, shows an identification of Jah with Aa, two names which have every appearance of being etymologically connected.” Jah’s name is one of the names for “god’”in the Assyro-Babylonian language. (Mackenzie 1915) As well, at excavations of Ebla, which we looked at earlier for evidence of the ritual use of psychoactive substances, researchers found indications that sometime after the reign of Sargon (died, 2279 BCE) the chief deity El, was replaced by another deity Ia (Freeman, 2011). In Religion in Ancient Mesopotamia, Jean Bottéro, hypothesized that Ia was the West Semitic (Canaanite) pronunciation of the Akkadian name Ea, and this was a Canaanite theonym for Yahu, the Hebrew YHWH. Although some scholars agreed with this, others have provided ways this evidence may have been misinterpreted. Circumstantial evidence of a means of connection between Ea and Yahweh could be seen to reach considerably far back. An Akkadian copy of Ea’s myth about Adapa were recovered on a tablet in Egypt at El Amarna, Pharaoh Ahkenaton’s capitol city (Patai & Graves, 1963). This is interesting, as Akhenaten was said to have had Semites employed in high ranking positions, similar to that which Jacob was depicted to hold. As well, he was also noted to have had contact with the Shasu, who are important figures in the Kenite hypothesis regarding the origins of Yahweh worship. As mentioned, the Father of Psychiatry, Sigmund Freud, suggested an origin of Jewish monotheism, with Akhenaten in his 1939 book, Moses and Monotheism. In relation, Moses disciple, Joshua, was known as “son of nun,” “nun,” being the Hebrew for “fish,” and a “fish being the main symbol of Enki/Ea. As well, in Talmudic times the term “dag” could be applied to both “fish” and the “messiah.” the gods,” “he who knows everything that has a name.” It is he who gives the king wisdom. He is also the god of the art of incantation. In his temple “the house of Apsu” in Eridu there was a notable tree, kiskanu, whose branches were used in ritual sprinklings.… The incantation priest was the representative of Ea (Ringgren 1973). The kiskanu tree “was the central point of various rites. A holy grove in the temple is … mentioned.” (Ringgren 1973). The second part of the name of this notable tree, kis-kanu has phonetic similarities with the early names for cannabis, through the linguistic root an, “which is found in various cannabis related words”(Abel 1980); particularly with the Indo-European root kanna, and its Assyrian and suggested Hebrew counterparts qunubu, and kaneh bosm, both of which can be phonetically translated with a ‘k’ or a hard ‘q’. In mythology, Ea’s servant and adopted “son,” the hero and temple fisherman, Adapa, was referred to as the “ointment priest,” indicating the importance of the rite. Ancient mythology has it that Adapa’s “command was", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634243995_cleaned.txt:276:c03c7d3f00da", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 2226, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634243995_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634243995", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634243995_cleaned", "chunk_index": 277, "text": "cannabis, through the linguistic root an, “which is found in various cannabis related words”(Abel 1980); particularly with the Indo-European root kanna, and its Assyrian and suggested Hebrew counterparts qunubu, and kaneh bosm, both of which can be phonetically translated with a ‘k’ or a hard ‘q’. In mythology, Ea’s servant and adopted “son,” the hero and temple fisherman, Adapa, was referred to as the “ointment priest,” indicating the importance of the rite. Ancient mythology has it that Adapa’s “command was like the command of Ea.” It was the ritual anointing of the priesthood of Ea that empowered them to act as the god’s representative, just as this same act marked the representative of Yahweh to the ancient Hebrews. Through this shamanic rite the anointed became “he whose ear Enki [Ea] has opened.” In relation, it is worth noting that one of the references to cannabis under the suggested Assyrian name azala, discussed in Chapter 3 was translated “So that god of man and man should be in good rapport: – with hellebore, cannabis and lupine you will rub him” (Russo 2005). A ritual enactment of Ea and Adapa’s relationship was applied to kings, who received their wisdom from Ea with the same act of anointing that passed on Yahweh’s wisdom to the King in Israel. Thus, it is not surprising that Ea appears in hymns from both Ashurbanipal and Esarhaddon with special reverence, or that the two kings are compared and connected to Ea’s anointing priest, Adapa. The mythology surrounding the god also indicates that he could “open the ear” of his initiates if they burned incense to him, indicating a similar psychoactive ingredient to that found in the anointing oil. Likewise it was the ritual anointing of Moses and the Levite priesthood with the sacred cannabis ointment, along with burning the oils and vegetable matter of the plant before the ark of the covenant, which enabled them to speak on behalf of the Lord. Notably, Ea was among the Gods invoked in the Assyrian Sacred rites, which involved the use of cannabis. This document … indicated to the magician, who was about to treat his afflicted patient, that a certain kind of plant or tree, the original which … grew in Eridu, and … contained magical qualities; and acting on this information the magician was directed to make use of a potion of the kiskanu plant or tree on behalf of the said patient. The text actually states the gods themselves made use of this plant to work a miracle of healing, and the implication is that the kiskanu plant was on this occasion of great benefit, it may again be made to perform the healing of a sufferer … provided that suitable words of power were recited … and appropriate ceremonies were performed, before the plant itself was used as a remedy (Thompson, 1903).

Image of Oannes, from a Babylonian seal, 7th century BCE. Oannes is seen as either the Babylonian version of Ea, or Ea’s emissary. Depicted here with the sacred kiskanu tree. Note the 7 speared leaf formation in the center, the woven net like pattern surrounding it, and the pinecone like buds with bags for collecting. Many images of the baskets (below) held with these “tree of life” images, indicate they were woven. Could this be another indication of the plant represented? A religious symbol which undoubtedly comes from the ancient east is the Tree of Life. This is found in some of the earliest Sumerian art, and continues throughout Mesopotamian history, being very prominent in the Assyrian friezes of the first millennium B.C. The mythological conception of the Tree of Life is also found in Genesis iii:22. H.W.F. Saggs, The Greatness that was Babylon: A Sketch of the Ancient Civilization of the Tigris-Euphrates Valley (1962). A fascinating current archaeological theory proposes that a variety of ancient Mesopotamian depictions of vegetation as the “Tree of Life” are ancient illustrations identifying cannabis use as an ancient entheogen. Interestingly, this connection was also proposed by myself and co-author Neil McQueen in our 2001 book, Sex, Drugs, Violence and the Bible. Dr. Diana Stein-Wuenscher, a British archaeologist with Birkbeck University in London, has suggested that the ancient Mesopotamian Tree of Life images are likely related to cannabis. In two articles, “Winged Disks and Sacred Trees at Nuzi: An Altered Perspective on Two Imperial Motifs” (2009), and “The Role of Stimulants in Early Near Eastern Society: Insights through Artifacts and Texts” (2017) Stein suggests that going back to prehistoric prototypical images, of sacred trees, and into the Assyrian period, in many cases, identify cannabis, which was used ritually, “ cannabis may have been singled out as an object of veneration. In this respect, it would resemble many other sacred hallucinogens, such as the Indian soma, the aboriginal peyote, or morning glories and mushrooms, that were worshiped as divine plants and used as a guide to enlightenment” (Stein, 2009). It is generally assumed that the primary subjects are feasting on bread and alcohol (wine or beer), which is imbibed from cups or through tubes. But given the fact that extracts, resin and leaves of medicinal and hallucinogenic plants were often mixed with carriers and eaten, drunk or inhaled, how can we be so sure? It is difficult to say what", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634243995_cleaned.txt:278:573e9967c311", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 2228, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634243995_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634243995", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634243995_cleaned", "chunk_index": 279, "text": "morning glories and mushrooms, that were worshiped as divine plants and used as a guide to enlightenment” (Stein, 2009).

But given the fact that extracts, resin and leaves of medicinal and hallucinogenic plants were often mixed with carriers and eaten, drunk or inhaled, how can we be so sure? It is difficult to say what is being consumed and whether it isn’t laced with some psychoactive substance. Only the associated motifs can tip the balance towards one interpretation or the other. The presence of isolated bird and animal parts, composite beasts and imaginary contest scenes, for example, imply that the human subject in their midst was consuming something potent enough to induce such visions. And the frequent presence of a tree motif (also on banquet scenes from southern Mesopotamia) would seem to be a reference to its source (Stein, 2017). Stein has also suggested that rather than indicating drinking through straws, these images could also indicate inhalation through tubes, as “ resinous vapors can be inhaled through a tube extending from a bowl.… This method suggests another possible explanation for the ‘northern drinking scenes,’ where a seated figure is seen inhaling through a tube.… The presence of the tree in several of these scenes could be a reference to the source of the hallucinogen” (Stein, 2009). In several cases, the ancient Near Eastern design includes a plant (mushroom, cereal grain, tree) or animal (toads, frogs, fish), which is often central and may refer to the source of the hallucinogen consumed. Something similar has been suggested as an explanation for the presence of a tree on two Achaemenid stamp seals that belong to temple brewers. In each case the tree appears to be the source of an important additive to the contents of the bottle that the brewer/ seal owner raises up in his hand. These examples suggest that hallucinogens played a central role in the social and ritual life of ancient Near Eastern society (Stein, 2014). Stein goes on to note that the sacred tree of these earlier images, was adapted into later more refined Assyrian images of the Tree of life, and still retained their sacred association with cannabis. A very interesting hypothesis, and one that we also examined at length in Sex, Drugs, Violence in the Bible (2001). However, I do believe Stein drew her own conclusions on the matter independently, and coming from an esteemed, trained archaeologist such as herself, it carries considerable credence. It seems unlikely that the sacred tree motif, a central feature in the state iconography of the Assyrian empire, represents the date palm, [a common hypothesis] a quintessentially southern species that does not grow north of Samarra.

It seems unlikely that the sacred tree motif, a central feature in the state iconography of the Assyrian empire, represents the date palm, [a common hypothesis] a quintessentially southern species that does not grow north of Samarra. By the first millennium BCE, the goats, the hunters, and the worshipers, who had flanked the sacred tree and the Qunnabu, the probable Assyrian word for cannabis, is attested in texts of the first millennium BCE. It occurs in a Neo-Assyrian recipe for perfume, and a contemporary letter refers to its use in ritual contexts (Stein, 2009). An image associated with the Assyrian sacred rites, is a stylized plant or tree, seen in an engraving made at the time of Ashurbanipal. This unidentified sacred botanical also appears in numerous other depictions, and has “in modern literature on the subject …[been] often described as the tree of life … but unfortunately no texts are known which describe in more detail the contents of these pictures” (Ringgren 1973). Amongst the first to connect the sacred and unnamed tree in Assyrian art with the mythical Tree of Life, was Sir A.H. Layard, who described and commented on the symbol over a century and a half ago. “I recognized in it the holy tree, or tree of life, so universally adored at the remotest period in the East, and which was preserved in the religious systems of the Persians to the final overthrow of their Empire.… The flowers were formed by seven petals” (Layard 1856). Wall relief created in the Neo-Assyrian period. Below the image the inscription in cuneiform texts relating to King Ashurnasirpal II reads: “The glorious god gives life to the king who rules valiantly, and he makes his dwelling.” It is unclear if the figures here are women, (no breasts) or the transvestite priests who were known to accompany the worship of Ishtar. Professor Widengren postulated that every temple had a holy grove, or garden with a Tree of Life that was taken care of by the king, who functioned as a “master-gardener.” By watering and caring for the Tree of Life, the king gained power over life (Widengren 1951). As a scribe of the Assyrian king Assurbanipal recorded in 650 B.C.: “We were dead dogs, but our lord the king gave us life by placing the herb of life beneath our noses” (Ringgren 1973). This last reference points to an incense, and by its name, the “herb of life,” we can easily visualize it as the plant depicted in the ancient stone engravings. In Near Eastern Mythology: Mesopotamia, Syria, Palsestine, John Gray notes that the “association of the king with ‘The Tree of Life’ … is familiar in literature and art", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634243995_cleaned.txt:280:92b39fe6ca12", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 2230, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634243995_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634243995", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634243995_cleaned", "chunk_index": 281, "text": "“We were dead dogs, but our lord the king gave us life by placing the herb of life beneath our noses” (Ringgren 1973). This last reference points to an incense, and by its name, the “herb of life,” we can easily visualize it as the plant depicted in the ancient stone engravings. In Near Eastern Mythology: Mesopotamia, Syria, Palsestine, John Gray notes that the “association of the king with ‘The Tree of Life’ … is familiar in literature and art in Mesopotamia, Canaan and Israel, with local variations” (Gray 1969). Gray also notes that like her counterpart Asherah, “the fertility-goddess Ishtar … may … be symbolized by the sacred tree.… This conception of the king as the medium of fertility through the fertility-goddess is expressed in Assyrian sculpture, where the king is touched by a protective genius with a cone dipped in some fertility substance, either pollen or oil.… The fertility is communicated by the king to a stylized version of the Tree of Life” (Gray 1969). We will return to this “cone” later. Stein identifies the Assyrian Tree of Life in the above image as a development of earlier depictions of the Sacred Tree, here becoming increasingly indicated as a possession of the “State.” As we have already noted Ashurbanipal’s ancient cuneiform library contained recipes for hashish incense which “are generally regarded as copies of much older texts” and this archaeological evidence “serves to project the origins of hashish back to the earliest beginnings of history” (Walton 1972). My co-authors of Green Gold the Tree of Life: Marijuana in Magic and Religion (1995) and I looked at a similar image, in relation to Ashurbanipal’s father Esarhaddon, and suggested that this image also contained an elaborate incense tent. “King Esarhaddon stands before an elaborate incense chamber with smoking … censer pictured in cut-away in the lower portion of the chamber; the upper chamber is tent-like with an opening” (Bennett et al. 1995). Conceivably, the tent was used to hold the smoke of cannabis incense, which the king would inhale by placing his head inside of it; which as we have seen in a number of variations, was a common means of marijuana inhalation in the ancient world, and an act of worship. The Basalt Stele of King Esarhaddon. Behind the sacred tree and Esarhaddon sits the Bull of Creation, while below are the early tools of ancient agriculture, perhaps indicating an intimate connection between the three symbols. Notably in this picture, we see both the Sacred Tree image, and the Date Palm, which has been suggested as the potential source for the sacred tree images by some researchers. However, as they appear here quite clearly together and separate, and there are other depictions of the date palm in Assyrian art, a connection between the Sacred tree and the date palm can be ruled out. However the potential connection between the", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634243995_cleaned.txt:281:efb3a927c768", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 2231, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634243995_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634243995", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634243995_cleaned", "chunk_index": 282, "text": "an intimate connection between the three symbols.

However the potential connection between the sacred tree and the qunubu used in the sacred rites, is made more intriguing. A letter written in 680 BCE to the mother of the aforementioned king Esarhaddon, that was discussed in Chapter 3 Identifies qu-nubu, specifically as a key ingredient of the Sacred Rites. When one reads the full passage regarding the qunubu reference in the Sacred Rites in relation to the stela with Esarhaddon, the incense tent, Tree of Life, and the sacred ox, their connection is even more cemented, as is the imagery of the woven basket depicted in the other images of the Tree of Life: So here in the Sacred Rites we see cannabis, in association with both the sacred ox, (or sacrificial “Great Bull that treadest the celestial herbage” as it is referred to in the Kettledrum ritual). Imagery that fits with Esarhaddon’s Stella. As well as a reference to the “basket” from the other depictions of the Tree of Life. This makes an intriguing connection between the images of the sacred tree and the qunubu references. In this imagery, one is reminded of the Biblical account of the Babylonian king Nebuchadnezzar eating “grass as doth an oxen” for seven years, in order to humble himself (Daniel 4:32). The bull imagery here may have been influenced by identical origins with a Persian myth. Zoroastrian mythology recounts how the ailing Bull of Creation was eased of its pain with cannabis by the God of Light Ahura-Mazda (Bundahisin 4:20). The imagery of the plough in the Esarhaddon stele also fits in with this line of thought, as King Yima 356 who was believed to have instituted the Haoma ritual, was given a “golden plough.” The plough is also clearly associated with the partaker of Soma in the Vedic tradition as well; “The Plough is attended by strong males, provided with a useful share and with a handle (to be held) by the drinker of Soma.” Interestingly as we shall look at shortly, a connection between these Assyrian images, and haoma, and soma has long been suggested. Generally the pine cone-like buds, held by the birdmen have been associated with “pollination” of the sacred Tree, however in other depictions they are being used in association with the King in the same manner.

In the 19th century George Rawlinson noted of the pine conelike buds from the Assyrian Tree of Life, that it is “as though it were the medium of communication between the protector and protected, the instrument by means of which grace and power passed from the genius to the mortal which he had under his care” (Rawlinson, 1881). As Rawlinson’s contemporary Francois Lenormant noted, “Often … it is held under the king’s nose, that he may breathe it” (Lenormant, et al., 1881). A scribe of the Assyrian king Assurbanipal recorded in 650 BC : “We were dead dogs, but our lord the king gave us life by placing the herb of life beneath our noses” (Ringgren, 1973). In relation to the Assyrian sacred tree images, we noted above Helmer Ringgren wrote in Religions of the Ancient Near East, that “in modern literature on the subject.” These tree images have been “described as the tree of life … but unfortunately no texts are known which describe in more detail the contents of these pictures”(Ringgren 1973). This was also noted by Dr. Stein. “In many cultures the name of sacred plants is taboo.… Indeed, Assyrian texts contain no unambiguous references to the sacred tree image or an explanation of its meaning” (Stein, 2009). The reason that this connection has not been noted before may be due to the fact that in the Ancient Near East matters involving religious and technical methods were considered closely guarded secrets. Professor H.W.F. Saggs noted that texts dealing with such matters ended with instructions such as; “Let the initiate show the initiate; the non-initiate shall not see it. It belongs to the tabooed things of the great gods.” We saw this in the Priest’s response to Esarhaddon’s Mother regarding her servant. Such holy knowledge was either only passed along verbally to initiates and not committed to writing, or “were written in a manner which was deliberately obscure…”(Saggs 1969).

Such holy knowledge was either only passed along verbally to initiates and not committed to writing, or “were written in a manner which was deliberately obscure…”(Saggs 1969). The image of the Tree of Life and its divine association with the king, as well as the use of cannabis as a holy incense and entheogen may both fall into such a category. These “Tree of Life” images are often described as depicting the Assyrian “Sacred Rites,” and we know cannabis was an important ingredient in these same rites. As Stein has also noted: “A later Neo-Babylonian text records the delivery of large quantities of qunnabu to the great temple of Eanna and Ebabbar, and there are recipes in which hemp is an ingredient of aromatic oil used for cultic purposes” (Stein, 2009). In a 1950 essay on cannabis, prepared as a United Nations Bulletin, R.J. Bouquet, which referred to the Assyria qunubu references noted “It would indeed be extraordinary if a substance, the use of which was to have a considerable effect on the social and politico-religious development of the peoples of Asia acquainted with it, had not left many traces in the monuments left behind by thinkers of those days” (Bouquet, 1950). We do have written references to cannabis, which by all accounts was an important ritual substance, as well as used medically. However no depictions survive. While with the “tree of life” images, we have depictions, which are associated with sacred rites, an incense tent, a sacred beverage, woven bags, but no surviving texts describing them. Is it too much to suggest that the unidentified symbol of the sacred plant, and the un-depicted plant for the word qunubu, are in fact a word and picture that describe the same thing – Cannabis, which was grown and revered as the Tree of Life in the ancient Near East? Like the potential entheogenic references to the Tree of Knowledge, John Allegro suggested that the original Sumerian word for the Tree of Life contained etymological references to intoxicate. “In Sumerian the words for ‘live’ and ‘intoxicate’ are the same, TIN, and the ‘tree of life,’ GEShTIN, is the ‘vine.’”(Allegro 1970). The Hebrew word used for life, (as in the Tree of Life), “chay,” has more to do with enlivening, fresh, or merriment, and the continued fecundity of nature rather than personal immortalization. François Lenormant the19th-century Assyriologist and archaeologist (and others) wrote that “It is part of the essential characteristics of the tree of life that an intoxicating liquor might be extracted from its fruit, a beverage of immortality”(Lenormant, et al., 1881). Lenormant identified the Assyrian tree of Life images with the Persian haoma and Vedic soma. Lenormant, referring to the “Soma plant of the Aryans", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634243995_cleaned.txt:284:30fdb3c07a15", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 2234, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634243995_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634243995", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634243995_cleaned", "chunk_index": 285, "text": "to do with enlivening, fresh, or merriment, and the continued fecundity of nature rather than personal immortalization.

Lenormant identified the Assyrian tree of Life images with the Persian haoma and Vedic soma. Lenormant, referring to the “Soma plant of the Aryans of India and the Haoma of the Iranians … the celestial drink of immortality,” noted that “the sacred plant assumes a conventional decorative aspect which corresponds exactly with no type in nature … it is precisely this wholly conventional figure, borrowed by the Persians from Assyro-Babylonian art, which represents Haoma on the gems, cylinders or cones of Persian workmanship, engraved during the period of Achaemenidae” (Lenormant, et al., 1881). Such an adoption of the figure, most frequently used to represent the sacred tree of the Chaldeans and Assyrians, on the part of the Persians, to signify Haoma, though bearing no resemblance whatever to the genuine plant, proves that they recognized a certain analogy in the conception of the two emblems. In fact, adaptations of this nature were made with great discrimination by the Persians… The adoption of the Chaldeo-Assyrian tree, to represent Haoma, therefore shows decisively that it was possible to trace some kinship between these symbols… (Lenormant, et al., 1881). In relation to the pine cones and the images of the Sacred Tree, and the winged Shaman with the buds collected in the woven baskets, depicted in an image with the consumption of a sacred beverage, indicating that the Assyrians may have practiced a Soma-like ritual. Considering cannabis’ profound role in Assyria, its association with the Sacred Rites depicted, it is hard not to see the Assyrian Tree of Life as an Assyrian Soma-Haoma, which in all these cases would have been prepared from the medicinal, nutritious and fibrous cannabis plant. The connection between the Assyrian tree of life and haoma, was suggested by a number of 19th century sources.

(Chapman and Hall, 1897) Ward, James (1851-1927), Author. The bird-headed genii which are often depicted surrounding the sacred tree have been suggested as representing the Garuda, who brought and spread the Haoma from its original Mountain abode (Lenormant, et al., 1881). The motif of birds dwelling near the summit of a mountain from which the sacred Soma was said to have originated, protecting and distributing the Soma, is shared by both Iranian and Indian accounts, so can be seen as part of their even earlier shared common ancestry.

[O]n the Assyrian bas-reliefs the sacred plant is guarded by winged genii, with the heads of eagles.… There is a singular analogy between these symbolic beings and the … Garudas of the Aryan in India, genii, half men and half eagles.… in the Indian myths.… it is the Garuda who recover the ambrosia … or sacred juice of Soma, with which the libations were made … giving it back to the celestial gods … [the Garuda] is made its keeper. His office, therefore, as well as the eagle-headed genii of the Assyrian monuments, besides the plant of life, is similar to the duty ascribed in Genesis to the kerubim which Yahveh placed at the garden of “Eden, after the driving forth of the first human pair, to defend the entrance, “and to keep the way of the tree of life” (Lenormant, et al., 1881). This situation left its most obvious mark on one of the last stories composed in the Old Testament, the tale of the fabled and prohibited trees in Eden. Both the Tree of Life and the Tree of knowledge have long been associated with the Iranian Haoma and its Vedic counterpart the Soma. As scholar E.K. Bunsen pointed out as long ago as 1867: The records about the “Tree of Life” are the sublimest proofs of the unity and continuity of tradition, and of its Eastern tradition. The earliest records of the most ancient Oriental tradition refer to a “Tree of Life,” which was guarded by spirits. The juice of the sacred tree, like the tree itself, was called Soma in Sanskrit, and Haoma in Zend; it was revered as the life preserving essence (Bunsen 1867). II…)… The original is the Soma of the Hindus, early deified by them, the sap of which was the beverage of the gods, and when drank by mortals made them act like gods immortal…The Hebrews have exactly adopted the idea: “And Jahveh Elohim said, ‘Behold the man has become one of us to know good and evil; and now, lest he put forth his hand, and take also of the tree of life, and eat, and live forever: therefore Javeh Elohim sent him forth from the garden of Eden … and he placed at the east of the garden of Eden cherubim, and a flaming sword which turned every way, to keep the way of the tree of life”… (Strange, 1874). Joseph Campbell’s description of the mythical white Hôm certainly brings to mind the Tree of Life as well: “the", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634243995_cleaned.txt:286:ce98e5b1af84", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 2236, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634243995_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634243995", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634243995_cleaned", "chunk_index": 287, "text": "he put forth his hand, and take also of the tree of life, and eat, and live forever: therefore Javeh Elohim sent him forth from the garden of Eden … and he placed at the east of the garden of Eden cherubim, and a flaming sword which turned every way, to keep the way of the tree of life”… (Strange, 1874). Joseph Campbell’s description of the mythical white Hôm certainly brings to mind the Tree of Life as well: “the … White Haoma Tree arose, which counteracts old age, revives the dead, and bestows immortality. At its roots Angra Mainyu [the Persian Devil] formed a lizard” (Campbell 1964). One can only speculate that the lizard lost his legs in this mythical transition and became the Biblical serpent. “The concept of the tree of life is found among many ancient people… In the Zoroastrian religion of the Persians the sacred tree was called haoma, which grew in a garden from which all the waters of the earth flowed (cf. Gen. 2:10)” (Gray, 1969). The 19th century occultist Helena Blavatsky may have been on to something when she claimed: “Plainly speaking, Soma is the fruit of the Tree of Knowledge forbidden by the jealous Elohim to Adam and Eve or Yah-ve, ‘lest Man should become as one of us.’” (Blavatsky, 1888). We … consider the comparison of the Cherubim who keep the way of the tree of life and the guardians of the Soma in the Veda and Avesta, as deserving attention, and we should like to see the etymological derivation of “Cherubim” from … Greifen, and of “Seraphim” from the Sanskrit “sarpa,” serpents, either confirmed or refuted (Muller, 1873). Numbers of authors have made the connection between Eden’s Trees and haoma/soma, and cannabis has long been considered a candidate for the latter. At least one 19th century author went as far as to connect all three. In An Outline of the Future Religion of the World (1884) T. Lloyd Stanley,7 referred to Mashya and Mashyana, the first man and woman in the Zoroastrian creation myth, who “lived originally in purity and innocence. Perpetual happiness was promised to them by Ormuzd Ahura Mazda the Creator of every good gift” and “the fruit of a wonderful tree Hôm which imparted immortality” and the evil “Ahriman Angrômaingus” who brought it all to ruin. Stanley noted that: The striking similarity of this legend to the Hebrew form of the Aramaic one leaves little room for doubt of their common origin. It seems highly probable that the strange effects of the fruit or juice of the Hôm or tree of knowledge of good and evil which on the one hand could restore the dead to life and on the other produced evil inclinations and destroyed moral excellence are in reality an allegory of the workings of that remarkable intoxicant the Sôma or Hôma extracted from either", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634243995_cleaned.txt:287:d8c0a80e3fe9", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 2237, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634243995_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634243995", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634243995_cleaned", "chunk_index": 288, "text": "Hebrew form of the Aramaic one leaves little room for doubt of their common origin.

It is almost certain that the Iranian reform in religion which occurred at the period of the separation of the two branches of the Aryans and was probably led by Yima embraced in addition to the doctrine of monotheism the reform of the excesses in the use of this intoxicating extract resin or fermented juice which had made part of the Aryan cultus. The Hôm tree embraces in one plant the qualities of the Hebrew tree of life and tree of knowledge of good and evil (Stanley, 1884). In my 2010 book, Cannabis and the Soma Solution, I made a solid case for both the Avestan Haoma and Vedic Soma, as originating with cannabis, using the same sort of archaeological, textual and linguistic evidence that we have been presenting here. I wholly stand by that research. The famed anthropologist Weston La Barre, suggested that “cannabis was part of a religio-shamanic complex of at least Mesolithic age, in parallel with an equally old shamanic use of Soma…” (La Barre, 1980). However, when cannabis is equated with the soma, we are talking about an unparalleled ancient world sacrament that connects numerous existing traditions, the once and future Tree of Life. Interestingly, Stanley saw the suppression of the Haoma cult in what became Zoroastrianism, as a step towards monotheism. In relation to the Assyrian Tree of Life, Diana Stein has made similar observations. Following the Tree of Life images from its pagan past into its role in relation to the King of the Assyrian Empire, Stein proposed that this imagery, which was originally related to a “ritual trance experience” was later “adapted over the millennia to reflect the increasing formalization of religious practice and its eventual appropriation by the state. This interpretation also explains the longevity and wide distribution of several associated, so-called pan Mesopotamian motifs. The conclusions, if correct, hint at mounting tensions between state and pagan religion that quite possibly inspired the story of Man’s Fall from Grace in Genesis 3^(𝔫) (Stein, 2009). Here Stein notes that “cannabis was available in Mesopotamia during the sixth century BCE at the time when the Hebrew Bible was compiled in Babylon”(Stein, 2009). Moreover, Ashurbanipal and Esarhaddon, who we have discussed in relation to qunubu, and the Assyrian “Tree of Life” images, both appear in", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634243995_cleaned.txt:288:54a02ef533ee", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 2238, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634243995_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634243995", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634243995_cleaned", "chunk_index": 289, "text": "pan Mesopotamian motifs.

Moreover, Ashurbanipal and Esarhaddon, who we have discussed in relation to qunubu, and the Assyrian “Tree of Life” images, both appear in the Hebrew Bible. There are no laws or records of court cases concerning the misuse of cannabis or of any other psychotropic plant. But given the central role of magic and divination in everyday Mesopotamian life, it is conceivable that those who could not afford the services of the court diviner, prophet, or magician turned to other methods or mediums. The use of drugs in urban contexts without the traditional ritual constraints of tribal societies not only poses a threat to organized religion, it also raises the long-standing controversy over the religious potentialities of psychedelic drugs … I suggest that this ongoing debate lies at the heart of Genesis 3, and that the fruit tree described by Eve as a source of beauty, food, and knowledge was, in fact, a potent but dangerous source of enlightenment. If that is the case, the authors of the story, in common with leaders of most established religions, take the stand that knowledge of the spiritual kind cannot or should not be attained by means of hallucinogens (Stein, 2009). A very interesting hypothesis in relation to what we have seen in this study. However, regardless of these potential Sumerian influences, there are other elements that have been seen as a not so subtle form of propaganda in the Eden mythos, directed at the pre-existing polytheistic religion of Israel, as practiced for centuries prior to this time, and even extending after this period as well. Recalling Ezra’s need to teach the people the Torah when he arrived in Israel, as well as the polytheistic element in 5th century BCE Elephantine, where Yahweh was coupled with Anath, we can see that despite the most severe attempt to restrict it, polytheism persisted as the religion of the people for some time. Hebrew Polytheistic Motifs in the Garden of Eden ay G. Williams, a Walcott-Bartlett Professor of Religious Studies at Hamilton College, in his article, “Eden, the Tree of Life and the Wisdom of the Serpent” explains: “The essential plot can be understood, not as a struggle between God and the Devil, but as a conflict involving the dynamic, royal, masculine God of the heavens and the primordial Mother Goddess who for millennia had been worshiped as the Mistress of the earth. To be sure, the story is told from the point of view of the former.

To be sure, the story is told from the point of view of the former. The serpent is reduced to being the subtlest of the creatures that the Lord God had made. The Goddess is not even mentioned by name, though she is there, as the tree of life, for that is how she was so often depicted among the ancient Canaanites. Indeed, because she was represented in tree form, it is not surprising that Yahweh declared that the tree and its fruit were taboo” (Williams, 2018). This symbolism carries over to the serpent as well: The wisdom of Asherah’s serpent is medicinal, healing wisdom. That is why her serpents coil themselves around the caduceus, the physician’s symbol. Her mysteries are the mysteries of herbs and poultices, of recipes and draughts … Asherah … offers the leaves of a particular tree to ease persistent headaches, the bark of a special shrub that grows high in the mountains to cure a skin disease. Many of the mysteries of the earth, of course, are dangerous. There are poisons as well as healing draughts, though even the poisons may have some healing use if their secrets are known. The Goddess hedges in her mysteries with ritual sanctity and orally transmitted lore. Each of her gifts must be used with specially prescribed care. This is particularly true for those psychotropic substances – soma, peyote, fly agaric, jimson weed, tobacco, the water of life (whiskey) et al – which can devour and kill but which, if imbibed with appropriate ritual, can also be revelatory. The Huichol of Mexico, who go to the land of the Mothers to hunt and collect peyote, do so with specially prescribed rituals and with a leader who knows the secrets of that land. Therefore, the result is not just a psychedelic high but a deeply transforming religious experience. Through peyote, the Mother allows the pilgrims “to see their own lives” (Williams, 2018). An increasing number of Biblical scholars have begun to see the Eden mythos as a subtle form of propaganda against the polytheistic beliefs that preceded Yahweh-alone monotheism. For one thing, the scenario takes place in a garden, an area condemned as a place of worship. Isaiah condemns “a people who continually provoke me to my very face, offering sacrifices in gardens and burning incense on altars of brick” (Isaiah 65:3). However, other elements of the myth can be found in descriptions of Solomon’s temple as it was described prior to Hezekiah’s reforms –such as the brazen serpent Moses had made, and which the people", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634243995_cleaned.txt:290:768579ff3bbd", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 2240, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634243995_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634243995", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634243995_cleaned", "chunk_index": 291, "text": "preceded Yahweh-alone monotheism.

However, other elements of the myth can be found in descriptions of Solomon’s temple as it was described prior to Hezekiah’s reforms –such as the brazen serpent Moses had made, and which the people had burnt incense too, which was pulled from the temple. One might also note here, that as discussed earlier, both the names of the Levites, who tended the temple and were later banned for idolatrous practices, and the “seraphim’ which delivered a coal from the altar to Isaiah’s lips with tongs, have indications of “serpent” in their names. As well the Cherubim who stood upon the Ark of the Covenant, are reminiscent of the Cherubim, who guarded the way to the Tree of Life, upon the first couple’s exile. Just as the first couple wove clothes upon discovering their nakedness through eating of the forbidden fruit, the devotees of Asherah wove garments in the temple (2 Kings 23:7). The idea that there is a connection between the temple and the descriptions of Eden, is by no way some new hypothesis, this is a long standing view. However, in the more traditional religious view, the temple was patterned after the Garden of Eden, rather than the reverse, as in the traditional view the story of Adam and Eve was known since the beginning of time, and accounts for our creation. In “The Garden of Eden, the Ancient Temple, and Receiving a New Name,” Alex Douglas, explains “The stories of the Creation and the Garden of Eden are some of the best sources we have for understanding the ancient temple” (Douglas, 2013): [W]e can clearly see … Eden’s paradisiacal state … reflected in its construction. In fact, much in the temple was designed to emulate and recreate the Garden of Eden for Israelite worshipers … Solomon decorated the walls, the Bible tells us that “he carved all the walls of the house round about with carved figures of cherubims and palm trees and open flowers, within and without” (1 Kings 6:29). The palm trees and flowers alone would conjure images of Eden, but the cherubim make the reference certain; in fact, outside of the temple and God’s throne, Eden is the only other place in the Bible where cherubim appear… …The temple was … meant to represent Eden, and many of the characters from the Eden story appear in Solomon’s temple. In Eden, cherubim were placed to guard the way to the tree of life, and in the temple, two giant cherubim – each fifteen feet tall – guarded the entrance to the Holy of Holies (see 1 Kings 6:23–28).

The priest in the temple represented Adam, and even the serpent makes an appearance. In 2 Kings 18:4 we learn that the bronze serpent made by Moses in the wilderness had been incorporated into Israelite worship (though the righteous king Hezekiah opposed this practice) (Douglas, 2013). Representing the more secular, historical view, that Eden was based on the Temple and its contents, in “The Garden of Eden as an Israelite Sacred Place” Seung Kang suggests the Yahwist “author’s description of cherubim in the Garden of Eden story was mediated by the iconographic representations of trees and cherubim in the Solomonic Temple” (Kang, 2020). We know that composite creatures such as cherubim and lamassu were featured in ancient temples and palaces in Syria and Mesopotamia. The Solomonic Temple appears to have adopted this tradition. Therefore, it is more likely that the Garden of Eden narrative was inspired by the Temple tradition than that the biblical description of the Temple was inspired by the Garden of Eden. The author of the Genesis narrative may have attempted to present the Garden as the Israelite center of the world by associating it with the Temple, the dwelling place of God and the center of the universe (Kang, 2020). n regard to sacred plants, we have been discussing a plant that was Iparticularly associated with Asherah, Ishtar, Ishara, Inanna and other Goddesses. A plant that was used ritually as an ointment and incense and woven into cloth, just as Adam and Eve wove garments after eating from the tree of knowledge of good and evil. A plant which was burned within the temple prior to the time of Josiah. Is it too much to suggest that an image of this sacred plant, or a living representative, may have stood within the temple at Jerusalem as well?

Somehow the knowledge of this skill of sewing, the beginnings of cultural knowledge, has come with the eating of the fruit of the knowledge of all things (Frymer-Kensky 1992). In ancient times Asherah was widely known by such titles as Progenetress of the Gods and the Mistress of Fruitfulness and Sensual Pleasure. However, Asherah was also known as “the Lady of the Serpent” and “was depicted as a woman, holding one or more serpents in her hands” (Merkur 1988). Referring to the earlier association of the Goddess with the serpent, and Hebraic reversal of Near Eastern mythology, Riane Eisler wrote; “The fact that the serpent, an ancient prophetic or oracular symbol of the Goddess, advises Eve the prototypical woman, to disobey a male god’s commands is surely not just an accident” (Eisler 1987). Importantly, a further Canaanite epithet of Asherah was “the Living One,” whose Hebrew form hawwah is anglicized as Eve.… Not a goddess but a legendary woman, Eve represents a slightly different syncretism of Canaanite Asherah in the Southern kingdom of Judah. Eve remained closely associated with a snake and with “every tree that is pleasant to see and good for food, the tree of life in the midst of the garden, and the tree of knowledge of good and evil” (Gen 1:9) (Merkur 1988). As noted by numerous biblical scholars, the Goddess is also seen in the figure of Eve herself.… In the Eden story she is given the epithet “the mother of all living,” an epithet like those given to various ancient near Eastern goddesses including … Asherah … Eve’s actual name in Hebrew (ḥawwâ), besides meaning life (for which goddesses were traditionally responsible), is also likely wordplay on an old Canaanite word for serpent (ḥeva). The name of the goddess Tannit (the Phoenician version of Asherah) means “serpent lady,” and she had the epithet “Lady Ḥawat” (meaning “Lady of Life”), which is derived from the same Canaanite word as Eve’s name (ḥawwâ). At the end of the story, Eve is punished by having to give birth in pain, whereas goddesses in the ancient Near East gave birth painlessly (George, 2014). With this imagery in mind, the Eden myth can easily be seen as a direct form of propaganda against the Asherah cult: Eve, and her relationship with the serpent is identified with Asherah “Lady of the Serpent.” Eden’s Tree of Life and the doublet of it, the Tree of Knowledge, were her sacred, and", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634243995_cleaned.txt:293:60d8863f6e12", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 2243, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634243995_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634243995", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634243995_cleaned", "chunk_index": 294, "text": "end of the story, Eve is punished by having to give birth in pain, whereas goddesses in the ancient Near East gave birth painlessly (George, 2014).

Thus the removal of Eve as Asherah from the divine presence of the Tree of Life, as well as the demonization of the Serpent associated with her, the presence of the cherubim who guarded the ark and the Garden, along with other elements indicate the Asherah traditions and the Eden narrative is based on the pre-monotheistic temple of Solomon and its rites. As a result of these events, by the end of the story Yahweh is supreme and in control of all divine powers and functions formerly in the hands of the Goddess, and Canaanite religion in general has been discredited. Yahweh is in charge of the garden (formerly the Goddess’ province), from which chaos has been removed. Sacred tree veneration has been prohibited and discredited, while Yahweh appropriates and identifies himself with the Tree of Life.… The serpent has been vanquished, flattened, and deprived of divine qualities, and thus is not worthy of veneration, and enmity has been established between snakes and humans. The Goddess has been discredited, rendered powerless, and is eliminated from the picture and sent into oblivion. Yahweh’s divorce from her has been made final… (George 2014). Professor of Religious Studies at King’s College in London, Joan Taylor explains that the asherim, a Biblical reference to a symbol of Asherah, was not a pole, but rather pruned tree of some sort, not a natural tree, “the asherim were to be distinguished from ordinary trees by being cut back in a particular way…. Despite being a tree, the asherim seems also to have been seen as kind of an idol in that it physically represented the Goddess” (Taylor, 1995). In favor of the asherim being a living tree rather than a wooden pole, it may be significant that always it is living trees, not dead bits of wood, which are iconic representations of fertility goddesses Their very livingness was an essential part of their meaning. Fertility goddess were, after all, deities of the life principle. As far as I am aware, we never get an iconic representation of a totemic wood pole reminiscent of a tree.

Nowhere in rabbinic literature is there the slightest suggestion that an asherim was ever a piece of wood stuck in the ground as a sacred pole (Taylor, 1995). “Mother Goddess, strongly connected with the Tree of Life, [she] is in a sense the tree itself. At the same time she is outside the tree, vivifying it to bud and flower.”( Johnson 1981). Like Asherah, “The goddess Ishtar was thought to dwell in a sacred tree” (Taylor, 1995). Thus a Babylonian Prayer to the goddess Ishtar proclaimed; Feminist scholar Riane Eisler has noted “Like the tree of life, the tree of knowledge was … a symbol associated with the Goddess in earlier mythology.… Groves of sacred trees were an integral part of the old religion. So were rites designed to induce in worshipers a consciousness receptive to the revelation of divine or mystical truths– rites in which women officiated as priestesses of the Goddess” (Eisler 1987). As we have seen, cannabis and in some cases mandrake were officiated by the cults of a number of Near Eastern Goddesses, Ishtar, Ishara, Asherah and Inanana particularly. “… [A] white stone cylinder seal from Mari, dated 2350- 2150 BCE, shows the king of the gods-probably to be identified here as Canaanite El… enthroned on a mountain between two goddesses (Athirat8 and Athtart?), which are in the form of trees…. In the seal, the tree goddess on the left holds a smaller tree with eight branches coming from a central trunk, perhaps indicating that she has the power over all vegetation.” (Taylor, 1995) Could the evidence of its ritual use of cannabis in the Holy of Holies at Arad, combined with the archaeological evidence for the ritual use of hemp cloth in the Levant, and condemnations against the Goddess, which included weaving within the temple, and the rejection of offerings of cannabis, all be found in the symbolism of the forbidden trees of Eden?

As Professor John Gray explains in Near Eastern Mythology: Mesopotamia, Syria, Palestine: “This [depiction]seems to indicate finally the explanation of the Biblical references to the ‘asherah as a natural or stylized tree in the fertility cult. This was the symbol of the mother-goddess, now known from the Ras Shamra texts as Ashera, the counterpart of Mesopotamian Ishtar…. The tree of life … is called the asherah in the Old Testament.”(Gray 1969). Kuntillet ‘Ajrud is an archaeological site located at the Sinai Peninsula in Egypt. The site is believed to have been an Israelite trading post. Excavations in the 1970s revealed two large pithos jars (used to store liquids) with inscriptions and illustrations.. The line drawing shows the tree of life, representing the goddess Asherah. Two caprids (goat-antelopes) flank the tree and eat from its leaves. Asherah rests atop a majestic lion. The textual inscriptions were written in early Hebrew script and refer to “Yahweh and his Asherah.” Left: Decorated bone depicting the visionary eyes, with the sacred tree and goat, above the vaginal triangle of “Mother Earth,” 6th - 5th millennium BC, Hagoshrim, Southern Levant.

The cannabis plant is most vulnerable in its early stages. Apart from insects and rodents, outdoor plants attract deer and presumably also goats, which like to feed on the tender young marijuana shoots. This phenomenon could be the source of the timeless Mesopotamian motif featuring a tree flanked by goats that we first encounter on Proto-Elamite seals of the fourth millennium BCE. Later Middle Assyrian variations on this theme that show goats tripping down the mountainside may illustrate the effect of eating potent young marijuana shoots.… Indeed, the goats’ strange behavior and apparent fearlessness in the face of danger … could be what alerted humans to the psychotropic properties of cannabis in the first place (Stein, 2009). Stein, who has been studying the Mesopotamian images of the sacred tree since the early 90s, notes in her 2009 essay “Winged Disks and Sacred Trees at Nuzi: An Altered Perspective on Two Imperial Motifs”: “As an object that over the millennia has many variants, is of interest to herbivores, humans, and hybrids … the tree motif could refer to a variety of different plants.

But there is at least one native species of the Near East that would account for many of its variations in context and appearance”: Cannabis sativa Linneaus, popularly known as marijuana, is a fiber plant of the steppe region to the south and east of the Caspian Sea. Available evidence to date suggests that cannabis may have been used as a gathered, if not cultivated, plant as early as the Late Neolithic and that, with the exception of Egypt, it was one of the most prominent cultigens in Bronze and Iron Age civilizations.… Virtually every part of cannabis can be used: the root for medicine (anesthetic), the stem for textiles and rope (and later paper), the leaves and flowers for intoxication and medicine, and the seeds for oil. Through breeding and natural selection, the plant has evolved in many directions. Varieties range from two to thirty-five feet tall. Branching patterns run from dense to loose. The branches can be as long as five or six feet or as short as a few inches. The various branching patterns form the plant into shapes ranging from cylindrical to conical to ovoid to very sparse and gangly. Furthermore, the shape and color of the leaves, stems, seeds, and flowering clusters are all variable characteristics that differ among varieties. In common with the cannabis plant’s original habitat, the tree on Proto-Elamite, Nuzi, and Middle Assyrian seals grows in the mountains.… The Proto-Elamite trees are often short and have a thin stem with irregular branches like cannabis seedlings.… Proto- Elamite, Akkadian and Late Bronze Age examples can be round … or conical like certain cannabis varieties.… Others resemble flowering shoots … a single leaf … or an individual blade (Stein, 2009).

Starkey in a rubbish heap outside a temple at Lakhish. Image from “Understanding Asherah – Exploring Semitic Iconography,” BAR Sept/ Oct. 1991. The Asherim and the MenorahThe Lakhish ewer dates to about 1220 BCE, the time when schol-Asherah was popularly worshiped. Note the goats on the right side, nibbling on a version of Asherah’s tree of life, that undeniably looks like the 7 branched menorah tree of modern Jewish worship. In, “The Asherah, the Menorah and the Sacred Tree,” religious studies Professor Joan E. Taylor, explains that the Lakhish ewer “may suggest that the menorah was designed with the usual form of an asherah-the cultic symbol of the goddess Asherah-firmly in mind” (Taylor, 1995): The ewer was seen as a kind of “missing link” to prove that Mesopotamian iconography directly influenced the iconography of the menorah, which is both a lampstand and a stylized almond tree.… It is certainly true that some ancient Mesopotamian representations of the sacred tree are strikingly similar in form to later Jewish menorot … the tree depicted in the ewer is more than a generalized Tree of Life. In fact, it was very likely to have been specifically linked to the great Canaanite goddess Asherah by means of the inscription, “Mattan. An offering to my lady ’Elat” … ’Elat is another name for the goddess Athirat/Asherah. Therefore, the trees of the ewer may be representative of her; in other words, they may be asherim (Taylor, 1995). It is important to remember here, that throughout the time Solomon’s temple stood, some 370 years, an asherim was there for about 236 years of that time in total. The earliest depiction of the menorah dates only to the first century BCE by comparison. There are descriptions of its construction in Exodus (25-31), but as Taylor notes, there “is a wide consensus among commentators in seeing the passages concerning the making of the cultic artifacts for the tabernacle … as coming from the Priestly source (P),written some time after the return from exile in Babylon” (Taylor, 1995). It is clear that asherim were not always made out of almond trees, and in fact there is no positive evidence to indicate that they ever were. All that can be said is that the almond tree was likely to have been one of the trees that might have been, in some areas, made into asherim.

All that can be said is that the almond tree was likely to have been one of the trees that might have been, in some areas, made into asherim. The significance of the almond tree for the goddess Asherah may have had more to do with its early blossoming. Asherah, as fertility goddess, seems to have been associated with the natural forces of life and regeneration. The pretty blooming of the almond long before Spring has really begun may have struck the Canaanites as a special sign of the activity of the goddess. (Taylor, 1995) I suggest that an almond tree was not intended by the depictions of the asherim, or by many of the images of Asherah’s “tree of life.” Instead I would suggest a tall tree-like bush of a plant, one that was burned as an incense offering to the goddess, as well as woven into ritual garments, one that was shared with her near Eastern counterparts, Ishtar, Ishara, and Inanna, and one that was at one time burned in the temple of her former co-creative partner and husband Yahweh. Cannabis was the Tree of Life. It therefore seems likely that the iconographical concept lying behind the menorah owes much to the actual forms of asherim, images of the goddess Asherah…. If the iconography of the menorah said anything in terms of theology, it was that Yahweh could, with impunity, absorb nuances of Canaanite cult into his cult, just as he could absorb features of other gods into himself, for the other gods were nothing: all was in the power of Yahweh. If a menorah looked something like an asherah, this was not a problem: it was Yahweh who “owned” trees, not Asherah, and Yahweh could easily make use of a bush to present himself to Moses. (Taylor, 1995) Could the menorah be based on cannabis as a stylized asherim? With what we now know this in the realm of possibility, and the menorah, in many ways looks like a 2 dimensional representation of a cannabis plant. Indeed, just like the seven branched menorah, one of the Hebrew references to the term kaneh occurs in Genesis 41:22, and depicts cannabis with “seven heads,” and this passage, which refers to grains, also disallows an interpretation of calamus, as calamus is not known for edible seeds or grains: “In my [ Joseph] dreams I… saw seven heads of grain, full and good, growing on a single stalk [kaneh].” As noted already, the ancient Hebrews ingested cannabis in heart-shaped cookies under its Persian name Sahdanag, translated as “Royal Grain” (Löw, 1925; reprinted", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634243995_cleaned.txt:299:0b374be7c8d2", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 2249, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634243995_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634243995", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634243995_cleaned", "chunk_index": 300, "text": "to the term kaneh occurs in Genesis 41:22, and depicts cannabis with “seven heads,” and this passage, which refers to grains, also disallows an interpretation of calamus, as calamus is not known for edible seeds or grains: “In my [ Joseph] dreams I… saw seven heads of grain, full and good, growing on a single stalk [kaneh].” As noted already, the ancient Hebrews ingested cannabis in heart-shaped cookies under its Persian name Sahdanag, translated as “Royal Grain” (Löw, 1925; reprinted 1967). It is here looking through the veil of time, back into the origins of this myth, arguably the most potent myth in the history of humanity, that we can see the depths to which cannabis and the entheogens have been hidden from humanity. Now, slaying the cherubim of superstition, we can take back the Garden and stand before the Once and Future Tree of Life. In many ways, the rediscovery of the cannabis Tree of Life and other entheogens, may mark the realization of Yahweh’s ancient fears, that our eyes may become open, as well as humanities return into the Garden of Eden, if in fact we ever left it at all… As Franz Kafka wrote, perhaps “we live continuously in Paradise … whether we know it … or not.” A fellow German similarly commented that “Through clever and constant application of propaganda, people can be made to see paradise as hell, and also the other way around to consider the most wretched sort of life as paradise” (Adolf Hitler). Paradise has been paved over and hidden from us. However, if there is one thing that can break through the pavement and restore the Natural Order, it is a plant. The rediscovery of the entheogens and the vast implications they have on theories concerning the development of religion give clear indications that we are in fact in Paradise but are the victims of a cruel and malicious hoax that would lead us to believe otherwise. If the voices of the Gods were the plant-based shamanistic revelations of our ancient ancestors, then the flaming cherubim and the God who placed them between us and the forbidden trees of Paradise are all of our own creation, and the Exile is self imposed. In our own time, one is reminded of the Genesis tale by the way our own Authorities have blindly prohibited these once sacred substances and branded them as evil, warning of death and degradation, if not expulsion from society, for those who are drawn to break these prohibitions, and taste these forbidden fruits. As a result of this conspiracy, humanity has become more and more separated from the natural world – Eden, which continually finds itself buried beneath cities and asphalt – The Highway to Hell is indeed paved.

As we have been looking at evidence that indicates much of the mythology of the Eden Genesis myth, was directed at a reversal of so many elements of the polytheistic situation in Israel, prior to the Monotheistic take over. It is worth looking at the situation just a few short centuries later, when the Genesis story itself was placed in a similar situation by Jewish and Christian Gnostic groups… ust as we have seen there was a hidden Hebrew religion in the background of the Hebrew Bible, early Christianity was considerably varied, and many branches were wholly different from the form of Christianity which has come down to us through the New Testament texts. It was not only Pagan groups that were suppressed and disappeared when the Roman elite decided to embrace the once rebel religion of Christianity, but also a whole variety of Gnostic Jewish and Christian groups, Ophites, Basilidians, Sethians, Valentianism, Marconians, Manicheans, to name but a few.. These sects are now known to us under the collective banner of “Gnosticism,” but each held their own various beliefs and takes on Judaism, Jesus and Christianity. As I have discussed this at length in early works (Bennett & McQueen, 2001; Bennett, 2010) and may return to it in detail in a later work depending on the reception to this book, for the sake of space and to retain its focus on the ancient Near East and the Hebrew Bible, I will only summarize some of that material here. For the first four hundred years after Jesus’ birth, the term “Christian” was used to describe a wide variety of sects and a large volume of different documents. Through the acceptance of one of the more ascetic branches of Christianity by the Roman ruling class, Christianity eventually became the state religion of its former persecutors. These other Christian groups were deemed as heretical, and many of them came to be grouped together under the blanket name of “Gnosticism,” which means “knowledge.” This was a fitting title, as most of these groups rejected the Catholic concept of “faith” and taught salvation was only attainable through personal experience and knowledge. We know of these Gnostic groups through the condemnations of them from Catholic Church figures like Irenaeus, Saint Augustine, who was a former Gnostic, and Hippolytus of Rome, and until the 1940s, just a few surviving documents.", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634243995_cleaned.txt:301:766697e1d096", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 2251, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634243995_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634243995", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634243995_cleaned", "chunk_index": 302, "text": "of them came to be grouped together under the blanket name of “Gnosticism,” which means “knowledge.” This was a fitting title, as most of these groups rejected the Catholic concept of “faith” and taught salvation was only attainable through personal experience and knowledge.

In 1945 a cache of Gnostic texts were found, now known as The Nag Hammadi Library, which vastly extended our knowledge of these ancient groups. As well, Paul, originally a persecutor of the faith, even after his alleged conversion, is shown in conflict with Christian groups, throughout Corinthians and elsewhere, that were pre-existent to his own conversion. These Christian groups were likely what would later be deemed “Gnostic.”1 One might better term the Christianity that came down to us through the Catholic New Testament, as “Paulianity.” Gnostic teachings offered an almost complete reversal of the Old Testament theology, especially of the Garden of Eden mythology. Like the adulterous Israelites discussed, who continuously backslid into the older polytheistic religious traditions with their numerous gods and goddesses, certain Jewish Gnostic groups had returned to a pantheon of deities. Further, they depicted the creator God of the Old Testament, Yahweh, referred to by them as Ialdabaoth, as the arch-enemy of humanity and pitted him against Adam and Eve right from the start in the Garden of Eden. In many ways the Gnostic reversals of the Eden mythology were actually more historically in tune with the original Near Eastern symbolism that had been reversed by the Jews, as can be seen by the re-deification of both the Goddess and the serpent. Some scholars have suggested that the commentaries, or Midrashes which resulted in the radical reevaluation of the Eden mythos, originated in 100B.C_(⋅) . in Palestine when the term “wise” first began to be applied to the formerly “crafty” serpent (Dart 1976). Possibly, some free thinking Rabbi or Essene, began to see Yahweh’s poor showing through history, and harsh treatment of his “Chosen-People,” as a sign that he was a false or evil God, and began to speculate on other interpretations of the myth. Clearly, in many Gnostic schools the serpent had been given the role of mankind’s beneficent instructor and initiator. Further the “tree of knowledge” with which the serpent seduces Adam, gives him his “god-like status over against the lower creator god [Yahweh-Ialdabaoth] who pronounced his prohibitions of the enjoyment of the tree only out of envy” (Rudolph 1987). Also, marking this theological return, we find the “Lady Wisdom” of Jewish Wisdom Literature, which is believed to have originated with the traditions of the Canaanite Goddess Anath2 , reemerging again under the personification of a goddess, known to the Gnostics as Sophia", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634243995_cleaned.txt:302:d54515c7a0f6", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 2252, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634243995_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634243995", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634243995_cleaned", "chunk_index": 303, "text": "“tree of knowledge” with which the serpent seduces Adam, gives him his “god-like status over against the lower creator god [Yahweh-Ialdabaoth] who pronounced his prohibitions of the enjoyment of the tree only out of envy” (Rudolph 1987). Also, marking this theological return, we find the “Lady Wisdom” of Jewish Wisdom Literature, which is believed to have originated with the traditions of the Canaanite Goddess Anath2 , reemerging again under the personification of a goddess, known to the Gnostics as Sophia (Greek for ‘Wisdom’). In a scene of transmutation reminiscent of Ashera’s earlier role as the cultic Tree, Sophia’s daughter Zoe, also referred to as Eve of Life (Eve of Zoe), entered “the tree of acquaintance” to hide from the Authorities (Ialdabaoth and his emanated co-creators). Further indicating such an influence from the earlier Near Eastern traditions, Sophia states that “I appeared in the form of an eagle on the Tree of Knowledge … that I might teach them and awaken them out of the depths of sleep,” a statement that certainly invokes the preexistent imagery contained on Near Eastern inscriptions of the eagle-headed deities picking pinecones from the sacred Tree of Life. With the reemergence of the Goddess, the role of the woman in the tale, not surprisingly, became more important than that of Adam; she is created first and gives her consort life, bearing Adam as a virgin, and acting as her own midwife. In response to the woman’s power, the “Authorities’”put a deep sleep over Adam, and conspire to “instruct him in his sleep to the effect that she [Eve] came from his rib, in order that his wife may obey, and he may be lord over her.” Indicating that they may have had some understanding of the origins of the Judaic Eden mythology, the Gnostic tractate “On the Origins of the World,” uses the definite plural term “Authorities” to describe the usually singular role applied to God in the Genesis version. This is interesting considering that the Hebrew name translated as God, Elohim, is also a plural, and the words spoken by God in the Genesis account indicate more than one figure; as after Adam ate from the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil, God laments that Adam has “become as one of us.” Again in tune with the Near Eastern predecessors of the Hebrew Eden mythos, the Gnostic reversals included the reinstatement of the serpent as mankind’s true benefactor. Although referred to as the “Beast” by the Authorities, the Serpent was envisioned by the Gnostics as the “Instructor … the wisest of all beings,” who worked in conjunction with Sophia for the salvation of humanity through knowledge, back to the kingdom of light from which their spirits were believed to have originally emanated.

Gnostic groups, such as the Naasenes and the Ophites, took their names from words that meant serpent, in honor of Eden’s wise instructor. (Through the Gnostic’s view of the Serpent as a beneficial Redeemer figure, he later became equated with the spirit of Christ that descended on the mortal Jesus.) The Gnostic retelling of the Eden tale, in the tractates “The Testimony of Truth,” and “On the Origins of the World,” begin much the same as the Old Testament version, with God giving the command to Adam; “From every [tree] you may eat, [but] from the tree which is in the midst of Paradise do not eat, for on the day that you eat from it you will surely die.” Like the crafty serpent in Genesis, the Gnostic serpent-Instructor is described as “wiser than all the animals that were in Paradise,” and convinced Eve to eat, telling her, “On the day when you eat from the tree which is in the midst of Paradise the eyes of your mind will be opened.” Eve, in turn seduces Adam, “Then their intellect became open. For when they had eaten the light of acquaintance had shone upon them” and upon recognizing their nakedness the two sew fig leaf girdles. Still in sync with the Genesis account, Adam, with a guilty conscience hides himself, when he sees God coming. Unable to find Adam, God calls out to him, and Adam answers sheepishly, from under the tree that he was hiding beneath. At that moment God comprehends Adam’s transgression, cursing the serpent as the “devil,” and casting Adam and Eve from Paradise, lest they “take from the tree of life and eat and live for ever.” It is at this point that the Gnostic view of the Eden story takes the most drastic shift in direction. As the Gnostic writer of “The Testimony of Truth,” explains: But of what sort is this God? First [he] maliciously refused Adam from eating of the tree of knowledge. And secondly he said, “Adam, where are you?” God does not have foreknowledge; (otherwise), would he not know from the beginning? [And] afterwards he said, “Let us cast him [out] of this place, lest he eat of the tree of life and live for ever.” Surely he has shown himself to be a malicious grudger. And what kind of a God is this? For great is the blindness of those who read, and they did not know him.

The Gnostic scholar Birger A. Pearson points out in his introduction to the Gnostic tractate that: “This material was probably based on a previously existing source, to which the author of the Testim. Truth has added some editorial touches, including an allegorical interpretation of the serpent as a symbol of Christ” (Pearson 1978). As much as the Eden Myth flavored later Old Testament stories, so did these Gnostics reversals of the myth flavor all future Gnostic belief. In fact it is in the 100 B.C.E. exhalation of the Genesis serpent that some scholars have seen the origins of the Gnostic movement, under the branch known as Ophitism, which as noted comes from a Greek term meaning “serpent.” This “Ophite” Gnosticism is said by Philaster to be pre-Christian … Celsus, the pagan philosopher, in his True Word, writing about the middle of the second century, makes no distinction between the rest of the Christian world and those whom Origen, almost a century afterwards, in his refutation of Celsus, calls, “Ophites” … the statement is sufficient evidence that there was a body of pre-Christian Gnosis, that the stream flowed unbrokenly and in ever-increasing volume during the first two centuries, and that the…”Ophite” still marks out one of its main channels. (Mead 1900) As Gnostic Scholar Kurt Rudolph explained: “Celsus reports of the Ophite Gnostics that they possessed a ‘seal’ the recipient of which was made a ‘son’ of the ‘Father’; his response was: ‘I have been anointed with the white ointment from the tree of life’…. In some [Gnostic] texts like the [Sophia and the Books of Jeu (Ieou)] the ‘ ointment’ is a prerequisite for entry into the pleroma, by which the highest ‘mystery’ is meant” (Rudolph 1987). The ointment here was an oil, and in this case a prerequisite for an astral voyage, that was a key aspect of gaining “Gnosis’”(spiritual knowledge) while still in the human form. Descriptions of the effects of the anointing rite make it very clear that the holy oil had intense psycho-active properties, which prepared the recipient for entrance into “unfading", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634243995_cleaned.txt:305:d12fdd803819", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 2255, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634243995_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634243995", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634243995_cleaned", "chunk_index": 306, "text": "(Ieou)] the ‘ ointment’ is a prerequisite for entry into the pleroma, by which the highest ‘mystery’ is meant” (Rudolph 1987).

Descriptions of the effects of the anointing rite make it very clear that the holy oil had intense psycho-active properties, which prepared the recipient for entrance into “unfading bliss.” Gnostic texts also make it clear, this holy oil was to be used not only for enlightenment, but also for medical purposes. “The Acts of Peter and the Twelve Apostles” demonstrates Jesus’ own view of the importance of this rite, when he gives the disciples an “unguent box” and a “pouch full of medicine” with instructions to go into the City of Habitation, and heal the sick. He tells them you must heal “the bodies first” before you can “heal the heart.” Similarly in the New Testament, Jesus does not baptize any of his disciples, but he does send them out with holy oil, in the oldest of the synoptic gospels: “And they cast out many demons and anointed with oil many who were sick and healed them” (Mark 6:13, KJV). As I have expressed elsewhere (Bennett & McQueen, 2001: Bennett, 2010) many of the New Testament “miracles,” might be explained by the established medical efficacy of cannabis, and clearly the description of using poultice on a blind man, indicates there was more than a mere laying on of hands. “Casting out demons,” has been suggested as a reference to treating epilepsy, which cannabis is very effective for, and is indicated for in early Assyrian texts. Records of topical ointments used in the treatment of “Hand of Ghost” an ancient malady now thought to be epilepsy, included cannabis as a key ingredient and indeed cannabis is known to be effective in the treatment of epilepsy. A prescription for the disease was “Cannabis, styrax, oak, Ricinus, Oenanthe, linseed, kelp (?), myrrh, wax of honey, lidrusa-plant, sweet oil, together thou shalt mix, anoint him therewith with oil.” As Russo noted; “cannabis was used with the plant El in petroleum to anoint swelling … [and] was also employed as a simple poultice” (Russo 2005). Amongst the many medicinal applications of cannabis is its use in relieving the pain of worn and crippled joints, and interestingly we read in the “Acts of Thomas”: “Thou holy oil given unto us for sanctification … thou art the straightener of the crooked limbs.” This application of the Holy Oil could reasonably account for the miraculous healing of cripples attributed to Jesus. “Cannabis is a topical analgesic. Until 1937, virtually all corn plasters, muscle ointments, and [cystic] fibrosis poultices were made from or with cannabis extracts” (Herer 1995).

Until 1937, virtually all corn plasters, muscle ointments, and [cystic] fibrosis poultices were made from or with cannabis extracts” (Herer 1995). A common and effective home remedy for rheumatism in South America, was to heat cannabis in water, with alcohol, and rub the solution into the affected areas, and in the middle of the 19th century Dr. W.B. O’Shaughnessy claimed to have successfully treated rheumatism (along with other maladies), with “half grain doses of … [hemp] resin” given orally. Centuries before the time of Christ Babylonian texts referred to hemp’s use in ointments for swelling and for the “loss of control of the lower limbs” (The Encyclopedia of Islam 1979). A 1992 archaeological dig in Bet Shemesh near Jerusalem has confirmed that cannabis medicine was in use in the area up until the fourth century. In the case of the Bet Shemesh dig, the cannabis had been used as an aid in child bearing, both as a healing balm and an inhalant. This find garnered some attention, as can be seen from the Associated Press article, ‘Hashish evidence is 1,600 years old’, that appeared in Vancouver newspaper The Province, on June 2, 1992: Archaeologists have found hard evidence that hashish was used as a medicine 1,600 years ago, the Israel Antiquities Authority said yesterday. Archaeologists uncovered organic remains of a substance containing hashish, grasses and fruit on the abdominal area of a teenage female’s skeleton that dates back to the fourth century, the antiquities authority said in a statement. Anthropologist Joel Zias said that although researchers knew hashish had been used as a medicine, this is the first archaeological evidence. (Associated Press 1992) As Zias and his colleagues explained: “We assume that the ashes found in the tomb were cannabis, burned in a vessel and administered to the young girl as an inhalant to facilitate the birth process” (Zias, et al., 1993). This find of cannabis in a Judean cave was further supported by the later analysis of glass vessels from the site which also contained evidence of cannabinoid residues (Zias, 1995). This find provided evidence of both inhaled and topical use. As well, the Bible’s New Testament’s 1 John describes the spiritual knowledge contained in the anointing: “you have an anointing from the Holy One, and all of you know the truth … the anointing you received from him remains in you, and you do not need anyone to teach you. But as his anointing teaches you about all things and as that anointing is real, not counterfeit – just as it has taught you, remain in him” (1", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634243995_cleaned.txt:307:472689b11193", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 2257, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634243995_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634243995", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634243995_cleaned", "chunk_index": 308, "text": "topical use.

But as his anointing teaches you about all things and as that anointing is real, not counterfeit – just as it has taught you, remain in him” (1 John 2: 27). The Greek title “Christ” is the translation of the Hebrew word Messiah, which in English becomes “The Anointed.” The Messiah was recognized as such by his being anointed with the holy anointing oil, the use of which was restricted to the installation of Hebrew priests and kings. If Jesus was not initiated in this fashion then he was not the Christ, and had no official claim to the title. The claim was Jesus was a Messianic King in the line of David. However, one thing is clear about Jesus and the Holy anointing Oil, despite the strict prohibitions that regulated its use to the High Priests and Kings in the Hebrew Bible, Jesus was freely distributing it and using the holy oil for widespread healing and enlightenment. An act of rebellion that might play a greater role than has been recognized in both his ministry and demise. This situation becomes even more explicit, when Gnostic texts of the first few centuries of the common era are looked at. In fact, anointing with this holy oil, vs water baptism, was a key point of conflict between these groups and what became the Roman Catholic Church. In the first few centuries AD, Christian Gnostic groups such as the Archontics, Valentians and Sethians rejected water baptism as superfluous, referring to it as an “incomplete baptism.” In the tractate, the “Testimony of Truth,” water Baptism is rejected with a reference to the fact that Jesus baptized none of his disciples. Being “anointed with unutterable anointing,” the so-called “sealings” recorded in the Indeed the Gnostic tractate the “Gospel of Philip” records that; “The anointing (chrisma) is superior to baptism. For from the anointing we were called ‘anointed ones’ (Christians), not because of the baptism. And Christ also was (so) named because of the anointing, for the Father anointed the son, and the son anointed the apostles, and the apostles anointed us. He (therefore) who has been anointed has the All. He has the resurrection, the light, the cross, the Holy Spirit.” Throughout the text “light” is “associated usually with chrism” (Isenberg 1978), and it is stated that if “one receives this unction … this person is no longer a Christian but a Christ” (Gospel of Philip). Similarly, “The Gospel of Truth” records that Jesus specifically came into their midst so that he “might anoint them with the ointment.

Similarly, “The Gospel of Truth” records that Jesus specifically came into their midst so that he “might anoint them with the ointment. The ointment is the mercy of the Father … those whom he has anointed are the ones who have become perfect.” As the German Gnostic scholar Kurt Rudolph explained: Anointing with oil has a greater representation than baptism in Gnosis and … is even regarded as more significant… This association … is linked up with the name of Christ, “the Anointed One.” Magical connotations also played an important role: anointing oil expelled demons and gave protection against them; correspondingly it cured and dispelled the “sickness” of the soul and body. Hence exorcism (driving out) was performed by means of anointing. The ancient magical texts provide abundant evidence for this application of oil. Often the anointing is taken as a “sealing,” the ointment as a “seal,” i.e. it is a protective act and declaration of property. The deity in this way assures the believers through the priests and they enjoy its protection.… In the foreground however is the concept of redemption, the gift of immortality which is transmitted by anointing (Rudolph 1987). The importance of the Holy ointment amongst the early Christians, is also attested to in the apocryphal book, ‘The Acts of Thomas’, which has the rite of anointing clearly eclipse the significance and importance of the placebo water baptism. This, and the ointment’s entheogenic effects derived from a certain “plant,” is aptly demonstrated in the prayers and invocations which the apocryphal book recorded as accompanying the rite. “Holy oil, given us for sanctification, hidden mystery in which the cross was shown us, you are the unfolder of the hidden parts. You are the humiliator of stubborn deeds. You are the one who shows the hidden treasures. You are the plant of kindness.

And, indeed, the trial did so. On February 4, 2004, nearly 28 years after the discovery of Aquash’s lifeless body at the bottom of a 30-foot cliff just off a South Dakota State Highway running through the badlands, the government commenced the first trial for her murder by prosecuting Arlo Looking Cloud. The government elicited explosive hearsay testimony from Kamook Nichols-Ecoffey that Peltier told her and Aquash in graphic detail how he killed two FBI agents in the June 1975 shootout. She also testified that she heard Peltier call Aquash a snitch, which is the alleged motive for her murder. No evidence of FBI misconduct was presented at the trial. The majority of the testimony presented had nothing whatsoever to do with Arlo Looking Cloud, but prominent members of the American Indian Movement (AIM) and my client, Leonard Peltier, in particular. Leonard Peltier or the AIM leadership, I would remind you, are not on trial for the 1975 murder of Annie Mae Aquash. They have not been charged with the crime, either, simply because there is no evidence against them. Only rumor, conjecture, and innuendo. And that’s all you were treated to in that courtroom this week. There was not one iota of proof presented to support many witnesses’ “beliefs”. And for every witness presented, there are any number of other individuals who could be called to appear and who would tell very different stories – that Annie Mae wasn’t afraid of AIM, but the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI); she had stated this to various individuals on numerous occasions; and she had actually put such fears in writing. In 1975, she said she’d been told by investigators that she would be dead within the year if she didn’t cooperate with FBI agents in framing AIM leaders and Leonard Peltier. So, with Peltier having virtually no ability to seek release except for discretionary forms such as clemency and parole, the government decided to use the murder of Ms. Aquash against Peltier to try him for her murder in the court of public opinion. Now, the government could use the murder of Aquash to its benefit with very little to no risk of exposing misconduct by the FBI. Looking Cloud was already convicted, Graham stood to be tried and Theda Nelson Clarke allegedly suffered from Alzheimer’s and/ or some other related form of dementia.

In August of 2008, a grand jury indicted Vine Richard Marshall on charges of aiding and abetting in the murder, thereby raising again the allegations about Peltier and AIM leaders. In 2009, Thelma Rios pled guilty for her role in aiding and abetting the murder of Aquash. According to the plea agreement, she made the call to Denver to have Aquash detained and brought to Rapid City to face charges by AIM that she was a snitch. She allegedly did so at the behest of two AIM members whose names were redacted. It is widely opined that the redacted names were those of Lorelie Decora Means and Madonna Thunderhawk, relatives of Russell Means. Why did the government not pursue further people involved at that time? Why did the government not prosecute Theda Nelson Clarke, an undisputed ringleader of Aquash’s murder, even though she was declared competent by two different judges in 2010? Why did the government not prosecute any one of the many other people implicated at the three trials? We will likely never know as a final grand jury investigation which commenced in the aftermath of Graham’s trial resulted in no further indictments and in a closing of the investigation by the United States Attorney by 2014. In this book, Dr. Wager identifies certain key issues which arose in connection with the Aquash murder trials and examines them in light of developing American legal philosophy. In doing so, he addresses, among other issues, the intertwining of two cases fraught with FBI misconduct: the investigation into the murder of Aquash and subsequent murder trials and its impact on the Peltier clemency attempts. In doing so, Dr. Wager provides unique insight into explaining what appears inexplicable by applying current legal philosophy to explain how the current American legal philosophies foster such governmental sleight of hand. As the Tenth Circuit Court of appeals pronounced in 2003, it is undisputed that the government engaged in extreme misconduct to gain the conviction of Peltier. Yet, the Court lacked any power to address the misconduct. Now, nearly 50 years later, Peltier still sits in prison, many years longer than those charged with murder for that time period.

Now, nearly 50 years later, Peltier still sits in prison, many years longer than those charged with murder for that time period. Ironically, Peltier’s efforts to seek clemency or parole will be impacted by the murder of Aquash which occurred nearly 50 years ago; a case initially fraught with FBI misconduct which now largely goes unnoticed and ignored. However, how the murder cases of Aquash are used to prosecute Peltier in the media is explained by analyzing the intersection of these cases considering current American legal philosophy. Extremely significant is that this book is very timely. Peltier filed a new petition for clemency in 2021. Peltier’s release has received strong support by Amnesty International, which has long espoused the unfairness of Peltier’s trial and conviction, as well as prison treatment. On October 13, 2023, thirty-three Members of Congress sent a letter to President Biden requesting him to grant Executive Clemency to Peltier, citing what they said were the “prosecutorial misconduct” and “constitutional violations” that took place during Peltier’s trial. As stated by United States Attorney James Reynolds, whose office handled the prosecution of Peltier, “His conviction and continued incarceration is a testament to a time and system of justice that no longer has a place in our society.” Yet, as Dr. Wager discusses, current American legal theory continues to foster such results. Occurring during what has been widely referred to as a “Reign of Terror”1 on Pine Ridge Indian Reservation, South Dakota, main unsolved crimes today.2 The Tribal President at the time, Richard A. “Dick” Wilson, notoriously oppressed his political adversaries using the brute and often deadly force of a policing group he formed, Guardians of the Oglala Nation (GOONs).3 Above all, Wilson and GOONs clashed with the American Indian Movement (AIM), a grassroots but militant organization of indigenous people from different recognized tribes throughout North America. Among its prominent members was Anna Mae Pictou-Aquash from the Mi’kmaq (also “Micmac”) tribe of Nova Scotia,4 murdered at age 30, presumably on Pine Ridge Reservation where her body was found in February 1976.5 According to FBI reports at the time, rumors had spread that Aquash had been killed not by Wilson’s GOONs, but by members of AIM, because she had been an informant for the FBI, or even that while aggressively raising money, she had threatened prominent AIM members that she would turn over secrets to the FBI if they did not contribute money to various upcoming legal matters, including Peltier’s.8 Over the years, as a popular movement formed to free Peltier through executive clemency,9 the FBI’s investigation of Aquash’s murder intensified, but also began introducing new incriminating details about Peltier, such as how he himself had threatened Aquash with a gun in her mouth, as well as bragged openly to his close friends about executing the FBI agents he had always publically denied killing.10 These dilemmas especially challenge American law", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634244510_cleaned.txt:2:87b42a733f24", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 2262, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634244510_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634244510", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634244510_cleaned", "chunk_index": 3, "text": "not contribute money to various upcoming legal matters, including Peltier’s.8 Over the years, as a popular movement formed to free Peltier through executive clemency,9 the FBI’s investigation of Aquash’s murder intensified, but also began introducing new incriminating details about Peltier, such as how he himself had threatened Aquash with a gun in her mouth, as well as bragged openly to his close friends about executing the FBI agents he had always publically denied killing.10 These dilemmas especially challenge American law but can also illustrate the value of continuing discussion by applying relevant thought from Continental Europe regarding interpretation, especially the ideas of Hans-Georg Gadamer (1900-2002), Paul Ricœur (1913-2005), and Jean-François Lyotard (1924-1998); likeminded jurists of the generation following them, including the Canadian Charles Taylor (b. 1931), the American Richard Rorty (1931-2007), and the Italian Gianni Vattimo (1936-2023); and others who have followed this discourse in recent years. When applied to now existing case law surrounding the Aquash murder, modern hermeneutical analysis combined with often contradictory postmodern perspective provides a bigger picture. What attempts to pass as tidy justice becomes only one side of a twisted reality. More specifically, this advocating of legal hermeneutics revolves around two basic themes: 1) that legal hermeneutics is nothing new or even foreign to American law; and 2) that interpreting texts (statutes or opinions) relies on Aristotle’s word “phronesis” (φρ∘vησις) : a circumspect and improvised decision-making process. With this in mind, to claim that the ambiguous texts functioning as laws in America, many of them written by now dead jurists, should somehow nonetheless carry with them an unequivocal interpretation is to deny a longstanding tradition of interpreting texts in Western civilization. American law has always relied generously on legal concepts difficult to define, such as “due process,” “good faith,” “fair play and substantial justice,” or “the reasonable, prudent person.” These tend to soften the otherwise harsh effects of a competition-driven society and its corresponding competition-driven jurisprudence with sometimes controversial winners. Still, how do influences originally imported from Europe fare as an intellectual force in modern American law, which is driven by its own breed of chauvinist politics and one-upmanship? Legal educations are meticulous and ruthless merit systems derived out of attempts to measure natural intelligence as combined with a willing surrender to the work ethic. In legal practice, an adversarial system relies on two competing points of view often resolved in a potentially heated and highly dramatic contest with a winner determined by a neutral third party. Longing for how rules govern American sports, most participants want a simple ruling so they can get on with the game. In this context, a law should be interpreted without fanfare or hemming and hawing, enforced the same way under any circumstances—a topic usually stemming from loftier, more universal concepts such as “the Rule of Law”12 or “Natural Law.”13 Unfortunately, the complete legal process with its lingering decisions", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634244510_cleaned.txt:3:b4c2b30964ea", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 2263, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634244510_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634244510", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634244510_cleaned", "chunk_index": 4, "text": "highly dramatic contest with a winner determined by a neutral third party.

Sometimes the simplest of disputes leads to the most complex of legal quagmires. Nonetheless, recent legal philosophies such a “textualism”14 lead some jurists to reexamine how laws are interpreted, perhaps hoping to disqualify some opposing philosophies along the way. These same jurists criticize what they feel are laws and opinions determined in some improperly spontaneous and even too sentimental application of immutable black-letter law. In the same year as the Aquash murder, when Gadamer’s Wahrheit und Methode appeared in English as Truth and Method, 15 a new and updated set of painstakingly articulate Continental ideas remarkably entered this give-and-take discussion as it existed in American law at a time when racial and gender issues were pressuring longstanding laws and procedures to be reevaluated and refurbished. It is important to take note of 1975, because although finally ending the Vietnam conflict changed dramatically the focus and resolve of the politically situated American Left, the countering American Right had still to reinvent itself. This reinvention of the American Right would eventually develop to represent similar breaks with traditional notions of judicial power and jurisdiction: the tax revolts of the late 1970s; the ensuing rise of Libertarianism; the rediscovery and zealous reapplication to politics of the writings of Ayn Rand16; and the election of Ronald Reagan in 1980, fueling a popularly perceived but decisive end to the Cold War and most of the lingering substantial sympathies in America for Marxism.17 Reagan’s revolution also included bringing out heavy legal artillery to specifically overturn Roe v. Wade18 as well as instill and maintain suspicion about the Warren Court and its decision in Brown v. Board of Education. 19 In other words, while the long murder mystery commenced surrounding a deceased Jane Doe on an Indian reservation in South Dakota later identified as Aquash, Gadamer had already introduced a new version of legal hermeneutics into a renewed American dialogue about the role of law and government in society. It all serendipitously occurred roughly at the same time as momentum was gaining for what was to become the Neo-Conservative movement. This had found significant second wind in concepts such as “originalism” and “textualism” as represented loudly and forcefully by early voices such as Raoul Berger’s (1901-2000)20 and Robert Bork’s (1927-2012).21 In comparison, Gadamer’s then still fresh and independent voice had already been inspiring its newly created English-speaking enthusiasts to reinvent what could", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634244510_cleaned.txt:4:1eb46c7afd0a", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 2264, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634244510_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634244510", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634244510_cleaned", "chunk_index": 5, "text": "role of law and government in society.

Representing understanding itself as something alive and living, not to be divorced robotically by an approach to interpreting texts as if they all had the same certainty and clarity as mathematical equations, a newly emerging American Left more quietly came into being.23 This inevitably led to a second generation of Gadamerian hermeneuts (e.g., Taylor, Rorty, and Vattimo) who championed a renewal of criticism of interpretation in law, especially as it might pertain to American law during and after the Neo-Conservative movement.24 It also brought forth a new third generation. How Gadamer’s ideas might ultimately be employed currently25 requires summation of what has been reinvention upon reinvention of this debate about interpretation. More recent decisions involving homosexuality and gender preference26 make the matter especially pressing. Although basically the same as formulated in the 1970s, the argument that legal hermeneutics plays an essential and crucial role in American law requires continuous modification but steadfast continuity. Postmodernism helps continue the discussion, but with some more drastic analytical maneuvers. Even younger minds, especially those of Steven Best (b. 1955), and Douglas Kellner (b. 1943), have broken new ground in these areas in more recent years. In this way, the second chapter of this book, which examines the status and influence of legal hermeneutics in modern American law, continues in the third chapter by concentrating on postmodernism. There is no wide consensus as to what postmodernism definitively entails or represents and, even more than hermeneutics, it is nonetheless applied as a rubric to define current trends in thinking and activity from as diverse disciplines as art and architecture to history and philosophy. Attempting to definitively define what postmodernism is; when it became recognized as an important trend of the late 20th-century; or what its limitations and opponents might be; may prove to be an even more difficult and elusive task than determining such boundaries for modernism itself or its relevance to the Neo-Conservative. Suffice it to say, on the other hand, that it is not necessary to define modernism before defining postmodernism based on the free usage both words still enjoy in the context of today’s intellectual discourse. However, attempting to define these articulations now that there has been a period of time that could appropriately be considered an opened-and-closed era", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634244510_cleaned.txt:5:17d88fac6b2e", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 2265, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634244510_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634244510", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634244510_cleaned", "chunk_index": 6, "text": "to be an even more difficult and elusive task than determining such boundaries for modernism itself or its relevance to the Neo-Conservative.

However, attempting to define these articulations now that there has been a period of time that could appropriately be considered an opened-and-closed era of postmodernism (whether actually continuing or ending as such, or ended long ago) allows the definition to be a more descriptive than normative task: the questions “what is modernism” and “what is postmodernism” now have a body of examples out of history to draw from. Yet for the purpose of an example chosen to illustrate this pregnant moment in history, Aquash’s murder especially helps keep relevant concepts alive with the extensiveness of both its legal and factual dilemmas. American legal hermeneutics would by definition even require thorough analysis as to how and why justice for Aquash cannot rest on its vigorous but irresolute legal process. his study cannot exhaustively examine all dilemmas of the Anna Mae Pictou-Aquash murder case, let alone conclusively solve any of them. Some are touched upon and implied in the Introduc tion, but at least three broad issues potent for further discussion and legal analysis help to illustrate why this complex murder case continues to tug at the very fibers that keep American jurisprudence consistently enforced and respected, let alone how it ranks in importance inside the well-estab lished canon of Federal American Indian law. This first chapter develops three broad issues, or “focal points,” based on the facts and litigation that have come to fore in the almost 50-year controversy surrounding the Aquash murder: 1) Federal and state criminal jurisdiction involving American Indians; 2) reassessing the facts of both the Aquash and Leonard Peltier cases for the purpose of a more accurate overview necessary to evaluate the legal outcomes; and 3) a brief nod to postmodernism as a recent method of ultimately analyzing and smoothing over specific contradictions involving Federal American Indian law. First, the criminal jurisdiction issues raised in the Aquash murder are so unusual and therefore brittle in terms of how they were resolved, that the analysis requires both a thorough examination of the official narrative and a careful analysis of four subtopics (sufficiency of an indictment; situs of a crime; extradition of indigenous people in general; and determining the identity of indigenous people). In summing this up, the issue is ultimately framed in the following way: in a murder case on Indian Territory involving a defendant and victim who are “First Nation” Canadian citizens (i.e., North American Indians recognized according to the laws of Canada, but not necessarily by the United States), can a Federal court of the United States nonetheless determine", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634244510_cleaned.txt:6:7b30185f2caf", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 2266, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634244510_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634244510", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634244510_cleaned", "chunk_index": 7, "text": "(sufficiency of an indictment; situs of a crime; extradition of indigenous people in general; and determining the identity of indigenous people). In summing this up, the issue is ultimately framed in the following way: in a murder case on Indian Territory involving a defendant and victim who are “First Nation” Canadian citizens (i.e., North American Indians recognized according to the laws of Canada, but not necessarily by the United States), can a Federal court of the United States nonetheless determine that such Canadian citizens belong to Federally recognized Indian Tribes making them subject to Federal criminal jurisdiction upon extradition? Second, this case piggybacks on another prominent case, not necessarily the double homicide itself that Aquash’s associate Peltier was convicted of in 1977, but certainly on the ongoing well-organized campaign for Peltier’s executive clemency, as well as the FBI’s counter-campaign to make sure he does not get clemency. The high-strung politics pitting the FBI and several other police organizations (Indian or otherwise) against AIM continue to produce rumors, disinformation, and damage control surrounding what was essentially an armed insurrection suppressed with deadly force. Determining the facts in such a context requires painstaking assessment outside the narrative of the legal proceedings. Finally, an afterthought suggests why trends of postmodernism in Federal Indian Law to deal with these troubling facts have already occurred. Because Federal Indian Law deals with a minority population striving to preserve its original culture, not assimilation into the majority culture (at least not anymore), contradictions and exceptions have little other legal argument backing them up than it simply must be this way, even though the law says it should be another way. Put simply, can postmodern interpretation of the facts and motives in this murder of an AIM activist at a critical time in history create a more complete and just model of the reality at hand? On February 24, 1976, around 2 p.m., a rancher found a dead human body on his land while tending livestock.27 According to his own description, it lay at the bottom of a 30-foot cliff, 100 feet away from South Dakota State Highway 73, about 10 miles east of Wanblee, and 18 miles south of Kadoka.28 This location in South Dakota is indisputably within the borders of Pine Ridge Indian Reservation.29 At first, the female body was declared an unidentified Jane Doe,30 and the official cause of death after an autopsy was exposure.31 At the request of FBI investigators present, the coroner then cut off her hands, which were kept for several days until after the body was buried before being sent to the FBI’s laboratory in Washington D.C. for fingerprint analysis.32 On March 5, the FBI lab identified the fingerprints as Aquash’s.33 Demands by AIM’s lawyer and Aquash’s sister to exhume the body from the local cemetery34 led to a reexamination of the remains, notably x-rays of the head, which determined Aquash", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634244510_cleaned.txt:7:4dccd97a5542", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 2267, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634244510_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634244510", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634244510_cleaned", "chunk_index": 8, "text": "At the request of FBI investigators present, the coroner then cut off her hands, which were kept for several days until after the body was buried before being sent to the FBI’s laboratory in Washington D.C. for fingerprint analysis.32 On March 5, the FBI lab identified the fingerprints as Aquash’s.33 Demands by AIM’s lawyer and Aquash’s sister to exhume the body from the local cemetery34 led to a reexamination of the remains, notably x-rays of the head, which determined Aquash had actually suffered a close-range gunshot wound to the back of the head.35 The bullet was still lodged in the skull, near the left temple.36 In 2003, more than 25 years after the homicide, a Federal grand jury indicted Fritz Arlo Looking Cloud and John “John Boy Patton” Graham for the premeditated murder of Aquash.37 Federal jurisdiction for the grand jury over the crime was appropriate by mention of the Major Crimes Act,38 as well as mentioning Federal statutes for aiding and abetting39 and murder.40 Although the Major Crimes Act requires that the perpetrator must be an Indian who commits the crime on Indian Territory before there is Federal jurisdiction, the indictment only specifically identified Looking Cloud as an Indian.41 Graham was in Canada in 2003 requiring extradition, but Looking Cloud was arrested in Denver to stand trial.42 The trials of Looking Cloud, Richard Marshall, and Graham determined the following as facts: Aquash had been staying in Denver with Theda Nelson Clarke43 (at the home of Troy Lynn Yellow Wood) both as a guest and fugitive from the law in late November, 1975⁴⁴ ; before Thanksgiving, some AIM members in Denver met informally at Yellow Wood’s house with a few prominent members of the Chicano organization Crusade for Justice, and there was discussion about Aquash’s fate for being an informant45; for reasons still undetermined, Clarke then procured the assistance of two young male “guards” (Looking Cloud and Graham) and in essence “took custody” of Aquash in the cellar, eventually transporting her on December 10 with the two guards to Rapid City, South Dakota, in the back of her Ford Pinto hatchback46; the four arrived in Rapid City after a six-hour drive from Denver and managed to enter an empty apartment where they spent the rest of the night47; Aquash was seen sometime in mid-December at the offices of the Wounded Knee Legal Defense/Offense Committee (WKLD/OC) in Rapid City with prominent members of AIM, but without the company of Clarke or her foot soldiers48; on December 11, Clarke and her foot soldiers attempted to take Aquash to the home of AIM activist Vine Richard Marshall and his family in Allen, South Dakota, but he ultimately did not allow them to stay there49; the four later drove to the home of Bill Means on the Rosebud Reservation, but did not stay there either50; later that evening, Aquash was driven to a cliff", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634244510_cleaned.txt:8:fdf9f4daaaa1", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 2268, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634244510_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634244510", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634244510_cleaned", "chunk_index": 9, "text": "members of AIM, but without the company of Clarke or her foot soldiers48;

the four later drove to the home of Bill Means on the Rosebud Reservation, but did not stay there either50; later that evening, Aquash was driven to a cliff off of Highway 73 and shot in the back of the head by Graham on direct orders from Clarke51; after the execution, Graham handed the gun to Looking Cloud, who claims he also feared for his life and in turn emptied the gun, firing all the remaining bullets into the ground52; and Clarke disposed of the gun used to kill Aquash under a bridge that Looking Cloud later led authorities to, but the weapon was never recovered.53 Looking Cloud was found guilty of first degree murder and sentenced to life in prison.54 The Eighth Circuit affirmed his conviction and life sentence.55 In 2007, Graham was finally extradited from Canada to face charges for Aquash’s murder.56 Anticipating jurisdictional issues regarding the Indian identities of both Graham and Aquash, a second grand jury issued a superseding indictment in 2008 with three counts,57 although pretrial motions to dismiss both indictments was eventually granted.58 The three similarly worded counts in the 2008 indictment invoke the following statutes: the first alleging Graham is an Indian and subject to Federal jurisdiction under 18 U.S.C. § 1153 (2006)59; the second alleging Aquash is an Indian, making Graham subject to Federal jurisdiction under 18 U.S.C. § 1152 (2006)60; and the third almost identical to the 2003 indictment without alleging Graham and Aquash were Indians.61 While still in South Dakota on September 9, 2009, Graham was indicted by a Pennington County, South Dakota, grand jury on two state charges: kidnapping resulting in death; and premeditated murder.62 Even though found not guilty on the premeditated murder charge, he was convicted of felony-murder kidnapping on December 10, 2010, and sentenced to life in prison on January 24, 2011.63 His conviction was upheld by the South Dakota Supreme Court on May 30, 2012.64 A writ of habeas corpus is planned.65 A 2018 appeal to the 8th Circuit also failed. Often described as a “jurisdictional maze,”66 options available in Federal Indian law to prosecute Graham required careful planning by prosecutors.67 Initially, a sound strategy should have been prepared to explain why Federal jurisdiction, not state or even tribal jurisdictions, was appropriate for a crime on an Indian reservation involving at least one recognized Indian. The U.S. Attorney for South Dakota at the time, James E. McMahon, nonetheless proceeded against both Looking Cloud and Graham using only the following language of the 2003 first indictment: “On or about the 12th day of December, 1975,", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634244510_cleaned.txt:9:3e97c7bf4d20", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 2269, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634244510_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634244510", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634244510_cleaned", "chunk_index": 10, "text": "prosecute Graham required careful planning by prosecutors.67 Initially, a sound strategy should have been prepared to explain why Federal jurisdiction, not state or even tribal jurisdictions, was appropriate for a crime on an Indian reservation involving at least one recognized Indian.

McMahon, nonetheless proceeded against both Looking Cloud and Graham using only the following language of the 2003 first indictment: “On or about the 12th day of December, 1975, near Wanblee, in Indian Country, in the District of South Dakota, the defendants, Fritz Arlo Looking Cloud, an Indian, and John Graham, a/k/a/ John Boy Patton, willfully, deliberately, maliciously, and with premeditation and malice aforethought, did unlawfully kill and aid and abet the unlawful killing of Annie Mae Aquash, a/k/a Annie Mae Pictou, by shooting her with a firearm, in violation of 18 U.S.C. §§ 1111, 1153, and 2.”68 A planned defense that both Canadians, Graham and Aquash, were not Federally recognized Indians and therefore Graham was not subject to Federal jurisdiction was obviously thought to have been overcome by mention of S2 , aiding and abetting,69 but ultimately needed the support of the second, superseding indictment in 2008, once Looking Cloud was in prison and his case was concluded. Under the guidance of McMahon’s successor, Marty J. Jackley, this superseding 2008 indictment argued its three almost identically worded counts in the alternative.70 In retrospect, these two strategies were only successful in that it got Graham extradited and eventually under the jurisdiction of state court. In retrospect, the counterintuitive legal theory that Graham and Aquash are not Indians raises relevant issues about the way this matter navigated the criminal jurisdictional maze for Indians on Indian Territory. Analyzing further the following subtopics helps focus on these issues: 1) are Federal indictments for crimes on Indian Territory sufficient if Indian identities of perpetrator(s) or victim(s) are not mentioned?; 2) how should the situs of the crime on Indian Territory be properly analyzed?; 3) are Indians properly extradited without notice to their Tribes or First Nations?; and 4) can the Indian identities of Canadian Indians ever be recognized by the United States? In light of extensive analysis of the Indian identities of Graham and Aquash in a brief by the United States answering Graham’s motion to dismiss,71 the United States also expressed confidence it could preserve the original 2003 indictment by stating both that aiding and abetting an Indian (Looking Cloud or even Clarke, Thelma Rios, and Marshall) was enough to invoke Federal jurisdiction,72 and that proving Indian identity could be determined during trial without having to allege it on the indictment, because Graham would have had “notice” of the Indian identity issue.73 In the end, the district court granted so-called “interlocutory dismissal” of both the 2003 indictment and the third count of the 2008 indictment74 against Graham.75 The United States appealed this", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634244510_cleaned.txt:10:5d61be284a55", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 2270, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634244510_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634244510", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634244510_cleaned", "chunk_index": 11, "text": "that aiding and abetting an Indian (Looking Cloud or even Clarke, Thelma Rios, and Marshall) was enough to invoke Federal jurisdiction,72 and that proving Indian identity could be determined during trial without having to allege it on the indictment, because Graham would have had “notice” of the Indian identity issue.73 In the end, the district court granted so-called “interlocutory dismissal” of both the 2003 indictment and the third count of the 2008 indictment74 against Graham.75 The United States appealed this decision to the Eighth Circuit, which affirmed the lower court by and large for the same reasons.76 Then state jurisdiction took over the prosecution of Graham as a non-Indian.77 The United States did not reconvene a grand jury, so the Indian identity issue for Canadians like Graham and Aquash was probably finally deemed too risky and complicated to continue.78 It has long been established that for crimes allegedly committed in Indian Territory, a Federal indictment is insufficient unless it states clearly that the accused, victim, or both is/are an Indian(s).79 It is ultimately a violation of the 5th Amendment right to a grand jury if no Indian race is specified on such an indictment under 18 U.S.C. §§ 1152 or 1153.80 These elements of the crime must be explicitly affirmed by the grand jury and proven by the trier-of-fact like all other elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.81 Jurisdiction based on the identity of the accused and victim of the crime can be raised any time.82 The United States relied on Pemberton and United States v. White Horse83 to preserve the indictments, which did not sway either the district court or Eighth Circuit. In fact, the Eighth Circuit also cited Norquay, 84 which specifically held that the Major Crimes Act cannot use accomplice liability to include a non-Indian accomplice.85 In the end, Graham prevailed at the Federal level.86 The State of South Dakota then stepped in to serve Graham since he had already been conveniently extradited from Canada and was therefore physically present in the state.87 Because the state charges were based on events outside Pine Ridge Indian Reservation, they did not entail proving Indian identity or how that issue should appear on the face of an indictment.88 In the Looking Cloud trial and appeal, the jury essentially determined that Aquash was murdered near a state highway not far on a horizontal plane from the area where the body was found, even though the theory that the body may have been dumped there after being murdered elsewhere, possibly off the reservation, was never argued.89 These facts now stand if deference to the Looking Cloud and Graham courts is upheld.

There was not evidence at the top of the cliff that a gun was discharged there or that any bleeding took place there.96 Nonetheless, the trier of fact in both Looking Cloud and Graham trials held that there was enough information to conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that the victim died at the scene.97 Precisely what details convinced both juries is not specifically stated in the opinions, or what theories were considered. As for extradition issues, Graham’s defense against state jurisdiction relied mostly on the Doctrine of Specialty,98 which ultimately did not apply because the Canadian justice minister had provided the prosecution with a sealed affidavit, waiving Canada’s rights as an asylum state.99 The only other extradition issue was raised marginally by an affidavit submitted to the Canadian court from a Chief of the Squamish Nation, who claimed to have recognized Graham as Squamish, giving him a Squamish name (“Sahd leetz”): whether Tribes or First Nations have sovereign powers when one of their members is extradited to a jurisdiction within the United States or some other foreign government.100 Even if the U.S. Constitution’s extradition language only dealt with the states,101 as did a corresponding statute,102 treaties between the United States and Indians sometimes had extradition agreements written into them.103 This supports the argument that tribal courts’ claims to extradition rights are valid,104 as does cases, such as Arizona ex rel. Merrill v. Tur-tle,¹⁰⁵ in which the rights of tribes to have their own extradition rules were respected. On the other hand, in State v. Spotted Horse, 106 South Dakota took note of a lack of an extradition clause in the Tribal Constitution from the Standing Rock Reservation where Spotted Horse was apprehended, which allowed his arrest without any extradition issues.107 Although Graham’s defense at the Federal level was emphatic denial that he and Aquash were Indians,108 the State of South Dakota bypassed all Indian Territory issues by basing its charges on events off the reservation.109 Still, the United States had", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634244510_cleaned.txt:12:7d7a3473d390", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 2272, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634244510_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634244510", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634244510_cleaned", "chunk_index": 13, "text": "hand, in State v.

Meanwhile, a proposed Indian identity statute, 18 USC S1150¹¹¹ would have solved the problem of what to do with Indians only recognized in Canada and Mexico.112 As for the problem with Graham and Aquash, only the first prong is at issue, because various cultural activities on Pine Ridge Reservation should have satisfied the second prong. As for the first prong, any “Tribes” they would have been born into, giving them the appropriate blood, do not appear on the list of Federally recognized Indians.113 On the other hand, the United States did not exhaustively search for variations of the bloodlines that might have helped their case. For example, Graham’s First Nation, the Southern Tutchone,114 is still part of the larger lingual family of Athabaskan, which the United States has recognized in Alaska.115 As far as Aquash and the Mi’kmaq are concerned, the first treaty with Indians after the Declaration of Independence in 1776 was with the Mi’kmaq, known as the Treaty of Watertown.116 Efforts to show this as Federal recognition of the Mi’kmaq have failed in the past,117 based on the fact that this treaty was before the U.S. Constitution and was technically only between the Mi’kmaq and the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.118 Nonetheless, the argument might have merit when considered liberally within the so-called Indian “canons of construction,”119 along with the fact that the United States officially recognizes the Aroostock Band of Micmacs, which are a branch of the group Aquash belonged to and part of the greater Wabanaki Confederation of Tribes.120 The United States probably still cannot overcome the Rogers test applied to both Graham and Aquash, even if a new indictment were issued, but if it could, dual sovereignty121 would allow a Federal district court to continue its prosecutions against Graham despite the state conviction, if Indian identity could ever be resolved. W hether by intention or not, the convictions of Looking Cloud and Graham actually serve to keep a tenuous relevance between Aquash’s murder and the ongoing Peltier controversy, where Aquash’s murder has always lingered as an ancillary issue.

Because of the now well-documented way in which much of the evidence against Peltier was fraudulently created by the FBI,122 a neutral observer might at first suspect the same aggressive and perhaps dishonest police work might have occurred to build the cases against Aquash’s now convicted assailants, Looking Cloud and Graham. This certainly creates a suspicion for which further assessment, if possible, of the facts are in order. The FBI’s ardent zeal in maintaining justice for the deaths of two of its young agents has morphed into an all-out campaign against executive clemency for Peltier. That makes an extra piece of otherwise irrelevant evidence in the Graham trial (which depicts Peltier bragging that he actually did kill the agents123) fuel further controversy. Clearly, both the FBI and AIM have now adopted Aquash as its cause’s martyr. For the FBI and its allies, she serves as an example of how violent and ruthless AIM actually was, unbeknownst to or perhaps unfairly ignored by Peltier’s liberal followers who mostly insist AIM is ultimately advocating a just solution to the unjust treatment of American Indians in the United States. For AIM, Aquash serves as an example of how violent and ruthless the FBI and its allies were during the Reign of Terror on the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation, as well as both how gory this violence could be and indiscriminate in terms of how it extended to women124 and children. Appropriately, Aquash remains a salient candidate for martyrdom to any cause, because in retrospect nothing that she was known to be involved with would in the least way distinguish her from others in this scenario to such an extent that either side should take such trouble to have her marked for death. The ongoing rumors that she was a snitch—whether from any actual collaboration with the FBI; an irrational belief by AIM members; or the result of the FBI’s alleged methods of making someone appear to be an informant (“snitch-jacketing”)—hardly amount to actually going through with the great risk and moral sacrifice of a formal execution. One of the earliest theories, that she was simply one more victim of random violence on the Reservation, had been the easiest, default theory among AIM supporters until the convictions of Looking Cloud and Graham. Other conspiracy theories involving some unknown element serving as the motive to kill her, such as she knew something that she was not supposed to know (what she knew about Peltier or some FBI secret), remain high conjecture with little evidence.

A patient historian is left to pick up the pieces of this now almost 50- year murder mystery and high-profile political issue.125 Suffice it to say, the convictions against Looking Cloud and Graham have most probably not settled the matter, which will continue to spawn theories from both sides. After all, these two very minor AIM foot soldiers were both at the most doing little else than carrying out orders within a chain of command that found them taking orders from an unstable woman. Even if Looking Cloud and Graham were rightly convicted of aiding and abetting in this murder, who else should be responsible, especially for giving such orders to Theda Clarke? Although nonetheless pressing issues, these concerns can only be presented here with broad strokes, because the facts have now become decades old and run the risk of vast distortion. The issues surrounding both Peltier and Aquash also tend to strip away any semblance of political unrest on the Indian reservation, suggesting that both the FBI and AIM were engaged in a petty, personal squabble. As naïve as it might at first appear, reminding the reader of the context of how political and armed insurrections very typically produce casualties emphasizes a crucial element in these controversies. First, examining the ultimate motives of the FBI should be placed in the context of all these questions. In light of that, Aquash’s case next should then also be placed in the context of the AIM point of view and its possible motives for using deadly force. Third, one more abbreviated overview of the Peltier conviction should help shed light on some of these possible motives from both the FBI and AIM. And, finally, a synthesis of all these aspects into the facts of the Aquash case might help give the closest thing to a definitive version of the murder possible here, even if conjecture remains high and unknown factors remain unsolvable without more evidence. Some of the most pressing motives of the FBI relevant to its cases against Peltier, Looking Cloud, and Graham, break into three basic categories: 1) maintaining the special reputation of the FBI, in that its elite status depends on inciting fear among criminals so that any resistance, let alone resistance using deadly force, will undoubtedly be met with power so forceful (if not at times even unlawful), that the “bad guys” will never prevail; 2) preventing AIM from instigating a full blown insurrection on the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634244510_cleaned.txt:15:b59d0a07d296", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 2275, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634244510_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634244510", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634244510_cleaned", "chunk_index": 16, "text": "relevant to its cases against Peltier, Looking Cloud, and Graham, break into three basic categories: 1) maintaining the special reputation of the FBI, in that its elite status depends on inciting fear among criminals so that any resistance, let alone resistance using deadly force, will undoubtedly be met with power so forceful (if not at times even unlawful), that the “bad guys” will never prevail; 2) preventing AIM from instigating a full blown insurrection on the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation in light of the 1973 71-day siege of Wounded Knee; and 3) making a personal retribution following the deaths of Agents Coler and Williams, not to mention acquittals in the first trial on self defense. Although specifying and examining such motives may be unusual in a legal analysis, a good part of the confusion surrounding this case stems from the FBI’s expert public relations and the remarkable ability of its agents to make statements that fend off any accusations that they did anything improper. A good example of this comes from Douglas J. Domin, one of the former Special Agents in Charge of the regional FBI office in Minneapolis: In direct contrast to this innocent plea of understanding is the more direct approach in Joseph H. Trimbach’s book.127 No other voice relevant to the FBI point of view here is louder and more voluble. Trimbach also served as the Special Agent in Charge of the regional FBI office in Minneapolis during the killings of Coler, Williams, Joe Stuntz, Aquash, and the Reign of Terror, although he repeatedly states in the book that the “Reign of Terror” was an exaggeration.128 Trimbach basically denies that those agents working in the FBI at that time were anything but heroes, and that Richard Wilson’s GOONs were doing anything but properly maintaining order. Reading Trimbach’s book brings pleasure and comfort to anyone who believes that Peltier is a ruthless murderer and was guilty all along; the trial of Darrelle “Dino” Butler and Bob Robideau was a farce; Judge Gerald Heaney of the Eighth Circuit inappropriately recommended clemency for Peltier129; or that the FBI is a shining and all but infallible organization that assiduously respects the Constitutional rights of all American citizens. In light of the first of the three FBI motives examined here, Trimbach supplies probably the best anecdote illustrating the necessity of keeping the FBI’s rough and tumble reputation as an elite policing power. ¹³⁰He tells the story from early in his career of capturing three escaped convicts in a Florida hotel who were armed and deadly, but did not make a stand because they did not want to “mess with the FBI.”131 Robideau expresses almost exactly the same sentiments as the escaped convicts in Trimbach’s story: Trimbach’s stories are even part of a larger genre of fictionalized accounts of real events emphasizing how police forces gain respect from the outlaws they are chasing", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634244510_cleaned.txt:16:d541cf93219d", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 2276, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634244510_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634244510", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634244510_cleaned", "chunk_index": 17, "text": "¹³⁰He tells the story from early in his career of capturing three escaped convicts in a Florida hotel who were armed and deadly, but did not make a stand because they did not want to “mess with the FBI.”131 Robideau expresses almost exactly the same sentiments as the escaped convicts in Trimbach’s story: Trimbach’s stories are even part of a larger genre of fictionalized accounts of real events emphasizing how police forces gain respect from the outlaws they are chasing if they play fast and easy with the rules themselves.133 Even though this might be scandalous to the general law-abiding citizens and bring the FBI legal troubles later on should their arrestee find a good defense attorney who knows how to expose the unlawfulness, some readers undoubtedly will find Trimbach’s romantic notion difficult to resist.134 Because of this blatant romanticization, Trimbach has definite problems making fine distinctions in his book, resorting to downright ranting and name-calling135 when attacking someone that might criticize the FBI’s policies. For example, when discussing one of AIM’s strongest arguments against the FBI’s tactics, that is, the fraudulent affidavits by Myrtle Poor Bear to gain Peltier’s extradition from Canada, Trimbach complains that somehow it was actually AIM, not the FBI, who used threats and intimidation against her without indicating anything specific.136 Meanwhile, Poor Bear has made several filmed interviews where she appears to be speaking freely claiming that she never knew Peltier, even though the affidavits prepared with the help of the FBI claim she was his girlfriend; she was not at the Jumping Bull Compound when the shooting occurred; the FBI threatened to interfere with custody over her daughter, Mardi; and these threats induced her to lie in the affidavits about knowing Peltier or witnessing anything about the shooting of Coler and Williams.137 Although Judge Heaney called this FBI tactic a “disgrace” on national television,138 Trimbach repeatedly denies that there was ever anything improper about the way the FBI built its case against Peltier using these Poor Bear affidavits.139 Unfortunately, this suggests there actually is something improper about the case against Peltier, and pronounced pressure from a highly skeptical element within the civilian population is entirely justified. Trimbach still makes a deliberately caustic and provocative irony in the title of his book when he refers to AIM as a “Mafia.” Of course, reference to the famous Italian Mafia in the United States insults AIM’s otherwise just cause of making right the injustices done against American Indians, because the Italian Mafia in America would scarcely have anything to do with public demonstrations such as sit-ins or forcefully occupying Government land. On the other hand, Trimbach’s point is that AIM was a militant organization that did not hesitate to use violence in the machinations that were its own ruthless politics and struggles for power within its own organization. This point must be driven home if a reader", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634244510_cleaned.txt:17:2ea25877148d", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 2277, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634244510_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634244510", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634244510_cleaned", "chunk_index": 18, "text": "just cause of making right the injustices done against American Indians, because the Italian Mafia in America would scarcely have anything to do with public demonstrations such as sit-ins or forcefully occupying Government land. On the other hand, Trimbach’s point is that AIM was a militant organization that did not hesitate to use violence in the machinations that were its own ruthless politics and struggles for power within its own organization. This point must be driven home if a reader is ever to fairly consider that AIM itself was responsible for the murder of Aquash. Although AIM certainly was not dedicated to the same vows of non-violence that Mahatma Gandhi or Rev. Martin Luther King, Jr. employed, there was certainly a kinship between AIM and other leftwing political organizations especially during the 1960s and 1970s that did not hesitate to use militant tactics: the Black Panther Party, the Weather Underground Organization, and a number of organizations around the world similarly using strategically armed insurrections and revolution to ultimately challenge the policies of unstable governments. Whether subtly or blatantly devoted to Marxism, such movements were certainly not Mafias, in the sense of using violent means and ethnicity for wealth and power, but actually gained respectability from America’s nonviolent left—especially certain movie personalities such as Marlon Brando or Peter Coyote—as necessarily fighting “fire with fire” in dealing with what were typically violent and unjust authorities suppressing them. The case of Nelson Mandela (1918-2013) demonstrates that another of these violent organizations, the African National Congress, not only elevated its leader to a respectable President of the government it was fighting, but also to a worldwide symbol of civility and world peace. Of course, there is still a vast difference between Mandela, who was a self-taught lawyer educated in the way of the white race oppressing him, and AIM, which is by and large made up of uneducated members with sympathies for the traditional way of life of their ancestors.140 Meanwhile, the FBI had the task of not only combating the violent militancy of the Italian Mafia in America, as well as other politically rightwing organizations such as the Ku Klux Klan, but also violent militancy from the American Left. Even before the 71-day standoff at Wounded Knee in 1973, AIM’s reputation for occupying Government land had reached a breaking point, probably inciting orders from within the Nixon Administration itself, as AIM-leader John Trudell himself admits: Keeping in mind that the seven-day occupation of Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) National Headquarters indeed was a disruptive act of trespassing, there was still never any harm to people either actual or intended. Probably as much as if not more than the Wounded Knee occupation three months later,142 this occupation fanned the flames that would eventually lead to FBI involvement with the escalated violence from the BIA police force on the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation.143 In light", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634244510_cleaned.txt:18:28f718fbc4ed", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 2278, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634244510_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634244510", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634244510_cleaned", "chunk_index": 19, "text": "himself admits: Keeping in mind that the seven-day occupation of Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) National Headquarters indeed was a disruptive act of trespassing, there was still never any harm to people either actual or intended.

Although the FBI’s now famous COINTELPRO, which involved sending spies into suspicious domestic organizations was then formerly defunct as an official program,145 an FBI spy named Douglas Durham successfully infiltrated AIM.146 Because the Wounded Knee impasse involved a negotiated end, at least a line of communication between the FBI and AIM leaders Dennis Banks and Russell Means had tentatively been formed.147 All of these facts reflect what was probably the most important and prevalent activity of the FBI, which was basic intelligence gathering. Even in this capacity, this intelligence gathering was secret and led to the sort of paranoia among AIM members that led them to believe Aquash was an informant. The final motivation behind the FBI other than their overall tough reputation and specific secret tasks on the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation involved deeply personal feelings that its agents had for fallen colleagues. Coler and Williams were agents in their late 20s and the ignoble way they were killed created bitter resentment within the ranks of the FBI. Coler’s widow, who was not trained professionally to make public statements about the death of her husband, nonetheless stated her frustration succinctly as follows: As much as only the most coldhearted would ever doubt the genuineness of her sentiments and the needs of the other agents for punishing someone for this crime, this statement also reflects that no one except the actual killers know (or knew) what happened and that reasonable doubt of Peltier’s guilt still exists, even if he were indeed the actual killer. AIM’s motives for deception break into the following categories: 1) general fear and paranoia stemming from extreme tactics from Federal and local policing organizations; 2) its own sort of strategic political posturing in light of the general public’s sympathies, especially for clemency for Peltier; and 3) maintaining discipline and the reputation of strength that comes from organizing a revolutionary organization at the grassroots level. All of these motives are aptly illustrated in one specific example involving one of Peltier’s prosecutors, former Congressman and Governor Aside from the often random and intimidating deadly violence from GOONs, which is", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634244510_cleaned.txt:19:7f373273258a", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 2279, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634244510_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634244510", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634244510_cleaned", "chunk_index": 20, "text": "tactics from Federal and local policing organizations; 2) its own sort of strategic political posturing in light of the general public’s sympathies, especially for clemency for Peltier; and 3) maintaining discipline and the reputation of strength that comes from organizing a revolutionary organization at the grassroots level. All of these motives are aptly illustrated in one specific example involving one of Peltier’s prosecutors, former Congressman and Governor Aside from the often random and intimidating deadly violence from GOONs, which is now well documented although almost entirely without legal remedy to the victims, AIM members were typically and certainly aware that the FBI was spying on them. In fact, the espionage tactic of “snitch-jacketing,” which involved keeping your opponents confused and disorganized by creating false suspicion that one of their members was a spy, was something that some Aquash theorists speculated created the motive behind killing her.149 Rumors abounded that AIM members were so suspicious of Aquash being an informer, that they were all but holding her prisoner within the small fugitive AIM group that escaped to the Pacific Northwest in Marlon Brando’s Winnebago.150 These unsubstantiated rumors of Aquash being a virtual prisoner all this time even include a story that the senior AIM members forced her to work on explosives with the idea that when they were used, her fingerprints would be on the equipment, falsely framing her for the deed.151 Aside from such paranoia, AIM members also wove theories of Federal and local policing forces deliberately planning to eradicate AIM through various tactics. For example, Banks has always held that Coler and Williams were part of a larger FBI conspiracy, and the day they died, they were to raid the “Tent City” near the Jumping Bull Compound where Peltier, Butler and Robideau were and essentially assassinate them: Although it is highly unlikely that any such methodical raid by the FBI would include exposing two young agents acting as assassins to such danger that they would be killed as they actually were, AIM members had good grounds to question the cover story that Coler and Williams were serving a warrant on an American Indian named Jimmy Eagle for stealing a pair of cowboy boots.153 No matter how genuine the suspicions of AIM has been over the years, they have certainly played their own sort of public relations game and collaborated to create their own spin on stubbornly missing facts. One of the most important stories that often is now left out of the Peltier discussion involves an addendum to Peter Matthiessen’s book, In the Spirit of Crazy Horse, and a character known only as “Mr. X.”154 Matthiessen interviewed a man in disguise who conveniently filled in all the holes of this story: Mr. X and two colleagues were delivering dynamite to AIM; they were riding in a “red vehicle,” as described in all the FBI agents’ radio broadcasts155; the pickup", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634244510_cleaned.txt:20:7617f9c438db", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 2280, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634244510_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634244510", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634244510_cleaned", "chunk_index": 21, "text": "of the most important stories that often is now left out of the Peltier discussion involves an addendum to Peter Matthiessen’s book, In the Spirit of Crazy Horse, and a character known only as “Mr. X.”154 Matthiessen interviewed a man in disguise who conveniently filled in all the holes of this story: Mr. X and two colleagues were delivering dynamite to AIM; they were riding in a “red vehicle,” as described in all the FBI agents’ radio broadcasts155; the pickup filled with explosives was to make a delivery to the Tent City; the agents followed the pickup as it was turning onto Jumping Bull Compound; Mr. X and companions brandished weapons, making the agents think they were going to shoot; the agents shot first; as the firefight started, Mr. X feared bullets would hit the explosives so drove the pickup away from the firefight; once the agents were wounded, Mr. X returned to the scene to examine the situation; Agent Williams raised his gun on Mr. X and purely in self-defense, Mr. X shot him dead; and purely by reflex, Mr. X turned to shoot the otherwise dying Agent Coler, twice.156 Even though this story was always considered unverified,157 Robideau adopted it as an ultimate alibi,158 with both he and Peltier claiming they knew who the real killer was, but could not reveal his identity out of loyalty to AIM.159 Butler now claims that this Mr. X story was a deliberate hoax propagated by Robideau.160 Apparently, the Mr. X story is largely abandoned by Peltier, whose latest known version of the event is that he simply “does not know who killed the agents and doesn’t want to know.”161 As much as the ultimate demise of the Mr. X story certainly suggests that prominent AIM members are able and willing to spin the facts and play a deceptive public relations game, Butler also claims he refused to go along with the Mr. X story because, in essence, the truth was on AIM’s side and therefore AIM did not need to resort to such things.162 If the AIM members were to try and spin a false alibi, it might have been convenient for them to blame the shootings on Joe Stuntz, who was killed at the scene and therefore could tell no more stories. Instead, the AIM version of the event suggests that someone outside of its Tent City shot the agents. This leaves many questions about the general nature of the AIM organization in its willingness and ability to keep secrets and how members could have carried out the execution of Aquash and kept it a secret for decades. Interestingly enough, Trimbach goes to great lengths to criticize Peltier attorney Barry Bachrach, calling him “a big-mouthed officer of the court”163 for calling the litigation against Looking Cloud and Graham a “set-up” and as being yet another way of “getting more shots", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634244510_cleaned.txt:21:bfc409d47899", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 2281, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634244510_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634244510", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634244510_cleaned", "chunk_index": 22, "text": "This leaves many questions about the general nature of the AIM organization in its willingness and ability to keep secrets and how members could have carried out the execution of Aquash and kept it a secret for decades.

Oddly enough, Banks had an extramarital affair with Aquash and still claims that she was the love of his life.167 Bank’s wife at the time, Ka-mook Nichols, who was a good friend of Aquash, since became involved with Hollywood movies and actually had a romantic relationship with Robert Ecoffey, the FBI investigator who put together the case against Looking Cloud, with the help of his own spy Richard Two Elk.168 When Nichols testified at Looking Cloud’s trial, she dropped a bombshell when claiming that Peltier admitted to her, as well as Aquash and Nichols’s sister Bernie Lafferty, that he was the one who executed the FBI agents and showed no remorse.169 Trimbach certainly makes hay of this, including Lafferty’s confirmation of such a confession, claiming that this resolves the case against Peltier once and for all,170 even if Peltier has never been allowed to confront these accusers and this nonmaterial fact was inserted into the Looking Cloud trial.171 Peltier’s “confession,” if true, could have been many things other than the silly braggadocio that it is portrayed as: mere exaggerated “locker-room talk;” intimidating Aquash to make her believe she was dealing with a killer; or some other similar deceit. Since the 1990s, other prominent Indian voices have ramped up the intensity of the Peltier and Aquash controversies. Journalist Paul DeMain has run a newspaper called News from Indian Country, 172 taking editorial shots against AIM to the point where Peltier sued him and demanded De-Main make a public statement as a form of apology.173 Other writers such", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634244510_cleaned.txt:22:b4826ac59a3b", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 2282, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634244510_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634244510", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634244510_cleaned", "chunk_index": 23, "text": "as: mere exaggerated “locker-room talk;” intimidating Aquash to make her believe she was dealing with a killer; or some other similar deceit.

Journalist Paul DeMain has run a newspaper called News from Indian Country, 172 taking editorial shots against AIM to the point where Peltier sued him and demanded De-Main make a public statement as a form of apology.173 Other writers such as Ward Churchill strenuously support AIM and other Indian issues, although Churchill often finds his comments dismissed by the mainstream press as an unreliable radical.174 There is reason to believe that the FBI has always exaggerated the tactics of AIM as a brutal terrorist group, spreading rumors throughout the trials of Butler, Robideau, and Peltier that AIM had been planning to bomb the courthouse or kill the jurors. In fact, Trimbach quotes a section from Means’s autobiography where Means claims that at his own trial, he was going to shoot everyone in the courtroom should the jury find him guilty.175 Although there is no evidence that AIM was planning anything violent during any court proceedings, especially in the case against Butler and Robideau in which the AIM members actually won, AIM did have the capacity to intimidate others in their ranks who betrayed their cause. For example, the situation with Norman Brown, a Navajo who was in Tent City with Peltier, Butler, Robideau and others, illustrates how the intimidation and deception went both ways—first from the FBI, then from AIM. At first, he was to be a witness for the prosecution, although now he claims his planned testimony was coerced: “They kept coming to a point where ‘who killed the agents. We know you know who killed them. We know you saw Leonard, Bob, and Dino.’ And they kept going on and on and they kept reminding me I was going to jail, that I had two counts of first degree murder against me. So, being there by myself, no choice. I sort of went along with them, you know, and it’s wrong because it wasn’t true.”176 Clearly any FBI interrogators would be highly trained and skilled at putting on the type of pressure required to get a guilty person to crack. On the other hand, as was the case with Myrtle Poor Bear, in the heat of the situation, these professional tactics could quickly become an inducement to lie, as Brown claimed later: Still, of all the reasons for AIM to use deception and intimidation, the most strange and bizarre public relations breakdown amidst all these rumors and lack of reliable journalism involved William Janklow, whose sensational antics of speeding through the back roads of South Dakota, drunk and without wearing pants, culminated after several arrests and convictions in his actually hitting and killing a motorcyclist.179 Janklow was also", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634244510_cleaned.txt:23:5f2d1affba6a", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 2283, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634244510_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634244510", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634244510_cleaned", "chunk_index": 24, "text": "these professional tactics could quickly become an inducement to lie, as Brown claimed later: Still, of all the reasons for AIM to use deception and intimidation, the most strange and bizarre public relations breakdown amidst all these rumors and lack of reliable journalism involved William Janklow, whose sensational antics of speeding through the back roads of South Dakota, drunk and without wearing pants, culminated after several arrests and convictions in his actually hitting and killing a motorcyclist.179 Janklow was also a litigant against Matthiessen for defamation,180 and was a suspect in the murder of Jancita Eagle Dear (1952-1975), a teenaged Indian girl of some prominence in the AIM saga, who accused Janklow of raping her.181 As one of the original prosecutors of Peltier, he exhibited a different zeal as he waged a campaign of appeals against his otherwise openand-shut involuntary manslaughter conviction, but the most interesting aspect is that in an era of scandal mongering, the mainstream press almost completely sat on the Janklow story. Between the extremes of deception on the part of both the FBI and AIM, certain overlooked facts help put together a more complete picture of what might have happened on June 26, 1975, when Agents Coler and Williams were tragically killed. Both the Matthiessen and Trimbach books have facts in them that support a more complete picture. First of all and foremost, it should always be mentioned that the day before the shootout occurred, Richard Wilson had just signed a deal to turn over 100,000 acres of the Pine Ridge Reservation (known as “the Stronghold Unit”) to the U.S. Government.182 This was land that during World War II had been used for military target practice, but the ultimate purpose of Wilson’s transfer remains unknown. Although questions of legality have been raised as to Wilson’s legitimate power to make such a transfer, there must have been some trepidation on the part of the FBI that some sort of protest or demonstration by AIM might occur. Trimbach points out that Agents Coler and Williams had visited the Jumping Bull Compound the night before the shootout and was familiar with the area.183 Therefore, if the agents were chasing a red pickup or some other vehicle onto Jumping Bull Compound, they would have the scene fresh in their minds. Another important detail is that an 18-year-old Robert Ecoffey, who went on to join the FBI and lead the investigation into the Aquash murder,184 was a BIA Police intern who was with Coler and Williams the morning they were killed and exchanged information with them. Coler was not as familiar with the situation, because he was originally stationed in Denver.185 A very important detail that Matthiessen glosses over is that one of the items found in Coler’s car after the shootout was a detailed map of the Jumping Bull Compound, with indications as to where bunkers filled with weapons might", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634244510_cleaned.txt:24:01197d454b7a", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 2284, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634244510_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634244510", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634244510_cleaned", "chunk_index": 25, "text": "into the Aquash murder,184 was a BIA Police intern who was with Coler and Williams the morning they were killed and exchanged information with them.

According to the information gathered from an eye witness at the Compound, Angie Long Visitor, about the AIM camp, or Tent City, seven men and three women (ten in all) would have been there when the shootout took place: Bob Robideau, Norman Brown, Leonard Peltier, Mike Anderson, Wish Draper, Norman Charles, Jean Bordeaux, Lena “Lynn” Gunston, and Nilak Butler.188 Peltier’s actual girlfriend (not Myrtle Poor Bear, but Norma Jean Croy) had earlier been at Tent City as well, but not on the day of the shootout.189 Long Visitor lived in a small green shack on the compound with her husband Ivis and three children. She heard the shots and looked out her window, seeing the two cars which the agents were shooting from, and one of the agents shooting in her direction, southeast, at an angle that was more easterly than where Tent City was located behind a group of trees.190 In an FBI report, she also claimed she heard shots coming from the trees to the left (west) of the cars.191 The FBI report goes on to say as Long Visitor was making her escape, she noticed Peltier’s Chevrolet van in the area next to the agents’ cars, but does not mention Peltier was there, although she recognized Bob Robideau, Norman Charles, and Joe Stuntz shooting at the agents.192 Furthermore, Norman Brown says that he and Joe Stuntz heard the shots and ran up unarmed from Tent City to investigate.193 When they discerned that shooting was occurring in the Jumping Bull Compound, although were unable to see anything or discern who was shooting or at what, the two teenagers ran back to Tent City to report to the older AIM members that a firefight was underway, got their guns, and returned to the scene.194 Butler had been sleeping when he heard the two teenagers tell him there was shooting.

Peltier claims he too was in the Tent City when the shooting began: Brown also says he saw Peltier shooting from the area where several junked cars were located, more in the vicinity of Tent City.196 Brown also remembers when the BIA Police car arrived, around the same time as Gary Adams’ car, apparently shortly before Agents Coler and Williams were executed, and describes how he was perfectly capable of killing one of the drivers if he wanted to: Trimbach makes much of the issue that Peltier’s van was the only vehicle on the compound that was operable, but that certainly does not mean that others were not permitted to drive it.198 The AIM defense depends on their claim that there were many other Indians on the Jumping Bull Compound that day, and that someone other than the AIM members, who admit to participating in the firefight, delivered the crucial coup de grâce shots that killed the agents. Trimbach attempts to poke further holes in Long Visitor’s account, claiming she should have recognized the “strange cars” of the agents, because they had visited the property the day before, even though there is no known record of her encountering or seeing these cars the day before.199 Referring to her facetiously as “eagle-eyed Angie,”200 Trimbach continues an attempt to impeach her account of what she saw in one part of Matthiessen’s book,201 claiming she should have seen Peltier and others to the left of her but did not mention this, although in the FBI report of Long Visitor’s account, which Matthiessen includes in another part of his book,202 she does see AIM members shooting to her left, but only Robideau, Charles, and Stuntz, and doesn’t mention she saw Peltier.203 “We needed to capture these two agents. We didn’t know that they were agents at the time. We didn’t have any idea who they were. But we felt it had become necessary to, ah, to, ah, capture them. And that’s what we were going to do. And we cautiously started to make our way towards these two cars, and about half way, I heard several shots fired…. Of course if Robideau had been willing to lie about the Mr. X story, his version of the shooting could also be suspect. Then again, if he was the one who delivered the coup de grâce shots to the agents, he could have in theory gotten away with confessing after his trial, since the “not", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634244510_cleaned.txt:26:22a55f26208a", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 2286, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634244510_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634244510", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634244510_cleaned", "chunk_index": 27, "text": "were going to do.

Of course if Robideau had been willing to lie about the Mr. X story, his version of the shooting could also be suspect. Then again, if he was the one who delivered the coup de grâce shots to the agents, he could have in theory gotten away with confessing after his trial, since the “not guilty” verdict would have given him protection against double jeopardy. That verdict was the result of an affirmative defense of self-defense, which means the jury determined that he did the act of double homicide, but had legal justification to do it. Of course, Butler’s verdict was in essence the same as Robideau’s, even though he was in a completely different position during the event. Although he did not show up to testify at the trial of Butler and Robideau, Mike Anderson had made the now discredited statement that Jimmy Eagle and his girlfriend Wilma had been at Tent City. Anderson further testified at Peltier’s trial that he had been conveniently situated on the roof of the home of Wanda Siers in the Compound, giving him a view of the entire scene, and saw Peltier come out of his Chevrolet van and begin the firefight. Norman Brown now says that Anderson was in Tent City at that time (“No, he was down there with us. He was with us before the shooting happened.”206), as did Jean Bordeaux, one of the women in Tent City at the time (“He was around the camp. I think he was changing clothes or hanging clothes up, or airing something out, but he was like busy around the tent, you know.”207). Most damaging to Peltier’s case was the ballistics report linking a shell casing found in the trunk of one of the agents’ cars to his AR-15.208 Judge Gerald Heaney explains that even though the Government improperly withheld a previous ballistics report that had excluded Peltier’s AR-15 as matching the shell casing, this did not meet the standard of probability209 that a jury would have come to a different verdict in order to grant Peltier a new trial: “The standard that the Supreme Court has established for granting a new trial is that you have to be convinced that it was reasonably probable that the jury would have reached an opposite result had the new evidence been presented to them. Now that’s a high standard. If the standard was one of possibility rather than probability we would have reached a different result.”210 Even if Heaney’s conjectural assessment of the probability standard for granting a new trial is reasonable in regard to what a jury would likely make of these two contradictory ballistics tests, which appears to exclude the possibility of a jury also considering Heaney’s own", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634244510_cleaned.txt:27:48a07a276c2e", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 2287, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634244510_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634244510", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634244510_cleaned", "chunk_index": 28, "text": "would have reached an opposite result had the new evidence been presented to them.

When any jury is seated in a court within the United States, how many of these peers of the defendant generally understand that the FBI has been known to aggressively pursue their version of the case, even if it requires falsely making up evidence? Judge Heaney constructs an ideal abstraction that carefully but thoroughly scrubs away any notion of corruption, since the court that includes the bench he is sitting on is ultimately just as much a part of the corruption as anything the FBI did to manufacture evidence. All things considered, if the evidence employed by the Government’s general dealing with Peltier beginning with his extradition from Canada appeared to be based on information the FBI ultimately made up out of whole cloth (Poor Bear affidavits, Mike Anderson testimony that he was on a roof and could see Peltier get out of his van, Jimmy Eagle’s presence at Tent City, and the improperly withheld ballistics test), clemency for Peltier does seem an appropriate remedy. Of course, the FBI through the voice of Trimbach and others will find every way to argue that their methods are sound (even if they clearly were not), and AIM members supporting Peltier will continue to push for clemency challenging the justice Judge Heaney and others have ruled upon under the circumstances. In the end, clemency is certainly appropriate when there is a mess made of things through either mistakes, impropriety or both. Finally, in one last example of the way in which certain facts in this case are distorted and have no resolution, Peltier lawyer William Kunstler describes the way in which Agent Gary Adams is on record as describing a red vehicle leaving the compound less than a half hour after the agents were killed, but then denies the record could be correct: Of course, if the record were indeed correct, it would indicate that the agents probably did chase a red vehicle, not Peltier’s van, onto the compound and that it fled the scene afterwards, leaving a very viable suspect for the shooting unknown and at large. Peltier’s van never left the scene. Whoever this was has not yet stepped forward or been definitively identified.

Peltier’s van never left the scene. Whoever this was has not yet stepped forward or been definitively identified. Still, keep in mind that Kunstler is a scrappy and aggressive defense attorney in this case and the story about a red vehicle was eventually denied by Butler. When Aquash’s murder remained a mystery in the eyes of those curious enough to entertain theories about it, the lion’s share of these theories reasonably pointed to Dick Wilson and GOONs as suspects. Some even suggested assistance by the FBI in at least disrupting the chain of evidence and investigation.212 These same theorists suffered disorienting whiplash during the 180-degree turnabout in which the FBI commenced a zealous investigation making prime suspects out of members of AIM. The theory that produced two convictions in court that certain AIM members executed Aquash for being a snitch indeed must have created utter shock and confusion among researchers of the Peltier case and related events. Aquash’s murder never became as notorious or famous as the case against Peltier, but many who always smelled something fishy about the circumstances surrounding Aquash’s murder may have been too stunned to delve deeply into the FBI’s new evidence. Clearly, the FBI’s timing and boldness effectively carried with it an element of shock and awe. Still, the original FBI scenario had Aquash being driven to the home of Means’s brother (Bill Means) before her execution on the highway.213 Means therefore followed these two trials carefully but never expressed any assertive doubt about the veracity of the FBI’s evidence and theory of the FBI’s cases against Looking Cloud and Graham. Other prominent AIM leaders, such as John Trudell, publically acknowledged his understanding of the new facts without making any claims they were false. Dennis Banks, who had called Aquash the love of his life, also never accused the FBI of inventing a case to further discredit Peltier or to cover up some still unknown motive that would have led to Aquash’s death. Both Trudell and Banks were prominent members of AIM, which begs the question as to how the ranks of AIM were ultimately organized and why a death sentence against one of its members apparently eluded prominent members who worked closely and had strong personal bonds of friendship with that condemned member. If the FBI acted improperly preparing the evidence for the Peltier case, much of the motivation came from the way Robideau and Butler were acquitted on a self-defense theory, when Agent Williams’s death occurred while he was presumably trying to surrender before being ignobly executed, and Coler’s occurred while he", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634244510_cleaned.txt:29:ba0194ef94e6", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 2289, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634244510_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634244510", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634244510_cleaned", "chunk_index": 30, "text": "ultimately organized and why a death sentence against one of its members apparently eluded prominent members who worked closely and had strong personal bonds of friendship with that condemned member.

If the FBI were improperly building the case against Graham and Looking Cloud, the motive for doing so had not nearly the immediacy and strong emotions as Peltier’s case did. Still, the ongoing FBI campaign against clemency for Peltier makes the emergence of the case against Graham and Looking Cloud a convenient way to keep its cause going. Still, Looking Cloud remains the primary source for much of the new information in the Aquash murder case, and the way the FBI interrogated him is a matter of record. As a heroin addict tormented with a guilty conscience for being a participant in a homicide, Looking Cloud relied on his “blood brother,” a friend named Richard Two Elk, to coax out the demons in his memory. Looking Cloud’s confession almost became a form of therapy, with Two Elk and the FBI assuring him that he’ll “feel better” once he has confessed all of the details of his bad deed. In this way, nothing about Looking Cloud’s fate in the American justice system suggests he made any sort of high pressure deal in exchange for information crucial to the FBI’s case. It was all freely provided. More likely, the coaxers of this confession were more interested in building a criminal case against Looking Cloud than nurturing his well-being and state of mind. Meanwhile, Graham has always denied the FBI’s case against him. His denial would have been legally much stronger if he simply denied ever driving Aquash anywhere. By admitting that he did once drive Aquash to Pine Ridge Indian Reservation within the timeframe of the FBI scenario, he freely stipulates part of the prosecution’s case against him—it places him in the car with her. All legal machinations aside, Graham’s version of events would have us believe that Aquash was transported from Colorado to South Dakota safely and was dropped off alone. If Graham is telling the truth, that would mean the woman eyewitnesses saw loaded into the Pinto hatchback tied to a board must have been someone else. The most implausible part of the FBI’s story involves the way the coroner declared exposure as the cause of the Jane Doe’s death. Ample blood on her clothes, and hair found on the side of the cliff indicating at least trauma to her head as she fell clearly suggest something other than exposure.

Ample blood on her clothes, and hair found on the side of the cliff indicating at least trauma to her head as she fell clearly suggest something other than exposure. Other cases of exposure during a harsh winter on the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation may involve people wandering into the wilderness in a drunken state, but this Jane Doe was located too far away from any populated area. Someone else must have transported her there and abandoned her. What has been practically the battle cry for DeMain’s journalistic efforts to bring justice for Aquash’s murder involve the incident that when Peltier was asked to vet Aquash at a Farmington, New Mexico AIM Convention, he threatened her by putting a gun in her mouth.214 In many ways, one wonders about the activities of two militant revolutionaries when one challenges the other’s loyalty. Peltier has commented on this incident, and Matthiessen mentions it in his book as Peltier and Aquash goofing around.215 Of course if Peltier is lying about the mood of the incident, resorting to the “we were just kidding” defense is a bit farfetched. On the other hand, Aquash defiantly scolded Peltier that day, daring him to go ahead and shoot her if he really suspected her of being an informant.216 Ultimately, the most important fact that emerges from this meeting between Peltier and Aquash is that she was defiant, even feisty, to the end. This included her irrepressible attitude towards other AIM members, especially those in the ruling elite and authority of AIM, let alone towards the FBI and police.217 This demonstration of Aquash’s disposition accomplishes at least two things: it dispels DeMain’s sensationalism, because she was not someone that would allow herself to be a helpless victim to police or let herself be victimized by other AIM members; and it also raises the question as to how and why she would ever finally let herself be “arrested” or “detained” by Theda Clarke in order to face accusations by the AIM members that she was an informant. There are simply not enough facts about Clarke to explain why she, more than an imposing warrior like Peltier, would have the power to detain Aquash in the basement, when Aqaush had no qualms about fleeing the American justice system as a fugitive, or standing up to any of Peltier’s taunts. In fact, Graham’s claim that things were indeed “heating up” at Yellow Wood’s home with Clarke to the point where Aquash called him so she could get out of there is more consistent with Aquash’s overall character.218 In light of this, even", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634244510_cleaned.txt:31:efe28e9a6df2", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 2291, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634244510_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634244510", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634244510_cleaned", "chunk_index": 32, "text": "than an imposing warrior like Peltier, would have the power to detain Aquash in the basement, when Aqaush had no qualms about fleeing the American justice system as a fugitive, or standing up to any of Peltier’s taunts.

Even all the other rumors involving Clarke tying Aquash to a board and stuffing her into the back of a Pinto hatchback appear to be things Aquash did not resist—if true. This makes the theory that the witnesses who testified that they saw all this might have seen someone else they thought was Aquash. Meanwhile the small inconsistencies in this tale of a midnight kidnapping and execution stubbornly remain: a Pinto hatchback has a large window that would allow any motorist to see into it, making it risky indeed to tie up Aquash and put her back there; if Looking Cloud indeed fired the remaining rounds in the pistol into the ground, why were no extra bullets recovered at the murder scene after a thorough search of the area; and why is it that Candy Hamilton testified that she saw Aquash at the AIM meeting that was purportedly serving as her death trial, but there was no mention of Clarke, Looking Cloud or Graham being at that meeting. Graham’s theory that the meeting with Hamilton’s sighting actually took place after the Government’s theory of Aquash’s death date was never allowed into Graham’s trial.219 If anything, a substantial question remains in that if AIM members were indeed involved in Aquash’s death, this does not put to rest other controversies, let alone shut the door on Peltier’s case for executive clemency. Other problems include what happens when trying to solve a murder decades after it was committed; using its facts for another purpose of derailing someone else’s bid for executive clemency; using the case built by an FBI investigator who was closely associated with the victims of Peltier’s crime; using a strong-willed FBI associate to become the “blood brother” of a heroin addict whose loose lips would eventually sink his own version of the story, which was that he was an innocent bystander; and in light of a string of fraudulently manufactured evidence in Peltier’s case, why would we not suspect that such tactics were also employed to amass the cases against Looking Cloud and Graham?

The tug-of-war between letting Aquash finally rest in peace and justice for Peltier now shows the former as the prevailing sentiment. f “[p]ostmodernism refers to a congeries of theoretical supposition I about the nature of language,”220 and it can also be applied to law,221 applying it to a congeries of facts may provide a more complete picture of this Aquash puzzle which, despite its boasts, the justice system provides only an illusion of solving. Certainly, all the other victims of the “Reign of Terror”222 still do not have such carefully litigated and publicized justice. If postmodern analysis of law has employed tireless scholars who artfully debunk the notion of a universal “Rule of Law,”223 and if postmodernism is applied to the often skewed logic of Federal Indian law, especially in otherwise contradictory legal doctrines set forth in the Indian Child Welfare Act²²⁴ and the notorious dodging of racial issues in Morton v. Mancar-i,²²⁵ how further can postmodernism tolerate rights to preserve the identity of groups?226 Would postmodernism dare tolerate as a local sovereign matter, say, an Indian tribal government that declares martial law? Meanwhile, criminal liability beyond two Indian foot soldiers acting upon orders from “higher-ups” in AIM or even the FBI (which actually had profound influence over the upper levels of AIM²²⁷ ) now ends in vows of silence and rumors of snitch-jacketing.228 Still, a postmodern or inconclusive amalgamation of the facts remains the most complete and appropriate picture of what happened if all that remains are legal judgments that do not entirely make sense, challenged typically by myriad independent theories.229 Any implementation of a modern legal system involves voluminous texts, written down officially, printed in journals and newspapers, published on the Internet, and even spread purely by word of mouth. This system must come to grips with its own inability in the modern world to stand as a respected institution based solely on the immediate meaning of these texts. his chapter is divided into five parts as follows: the first part ex-T plores how American common law has always had its own notion of “legal hermeneutics”; the second part introduces the elusive “nuts and bolts” of the approach to hermeneutics since the Enlightenment and how the term “phronesis” has become an important handle231; the third part further explores the Enlightenment as perhaps the source of spinning the idea of interpretation into the current issue between originalism and legal hermeneutics; the fourth part uses a specific example from Justice", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634244510_cleaned.txt:33:8eacb89d7593", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 2293, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634244510_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634244510", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634244510_cleaned", "chunk_index": 34, "text": "the first part ex-T plores how American common law has always had its own notion of “legal hermeneutics”; the second part introduces the elusive “nuts and bolts” of the approach to hermeneutics since the Enlightenment and how the term “phronesis” has become an important handle231; the third part further explores the Enlightenment as perhaps the source of spinning the idea of interpretation into the current issue between originalism and legal hermeneutics; the fourth part uses a specific example from Justice Scalia’s interpretation of the Eighth Amendment demonstrating how the two sides of this issue clash; and finally, the fifth part shows how the hermeneutics of suspicion have brought out some more controversy about the ongoing debate about hermeneutics, but ultimately reined it in at the same time, showing as well that Justice Scalia argues just as much from suspicion as the legal hermeneuts do. f the articulation “legal hermeneutics” were a purely philosophical inven-I tion, a jurist might attempt to argue that it has no place in the practicing legal world whatsoever.232 In other words, whatever philosophers think of lawyers might be valuable observations among philosophers themselves or even to laypeople interested in philosophy, if not only marginally to lawyers themselves, but has nothing reliably useful to offer jurists that would be authoritative, aside from informal constructive criticism. After all, lawyers require specialized training that philosophers typically do not undergo. In essence, lawyers are also the only ones required by society to set the standard as to how to understand their own sort of insider lingual acrobatics, such as those appearing in legal opinions, statutes, and legal memos, even though clearly lawyers must embrace publically the premise that their ideas are packed into such carefully simplified language, the average citizen can understand them. As a matter of consistency, a garden variety lawyer locked inside their own concept of what the legal world is may even apply their own version of a doctrine of stare decisis (which actually has been a hermeneutical rule all along, as demonstrated infra233): outside interdisciplinary ideas of legal hermeneutics should only be relevant to common law if a judge somewhere in a high court applied them to an actual decision. The equally common philosopher might take the bait to this argument by quibbling that all uses of language fall under the purview of modern philosophy, including even the most extreme or esoteric legalese, and, as long as lawyers, legislators, and judges are using language, they must yield authority over cutting edge developments of philosophy which sheds light on any new discoveries concerning the mysteries of meaning and interpretation.

If necessary, these ultimately quixotic arguments could be bypassed thanks to Francis Lieber (1800-1872),234 whose early 19th-century notion of legal hermeneutics actually was introduced into New York case law.235 Moreover, Lieber’s three-part classification of his approach to legal hermeneutics amounts to essentially the way law is still actually practiced and interpreted today: 1) variations of today’s Rules of Construction, which lawyers are supposed to learn often with Latin mottos such as “in pari materia” and which have been quoted in Latin in hundreds of American cases236; 2) using precedents, which is a general concept that supports the doctrine of stare decisis itself; and 3) authorities, which finds itself in today’s discussion of law in the form of articles and various writings and records of legislators, but also in the use of Restatements, which of course are not considered law, but are often used in legal opinions to interpret statutes and cases. In fact, Lieber’s very important distinction between interpretation and construction, which occurs within the first of his three categories of hermeneutics, emphasizes that interpretation has always sought to find the original intent of the lawmaker, while construction gives the interpreter license to actually build extra unstated rules into a law where necessary. The notable exception to this reverence was California, which in the first half of the 20th-century produced a string of criminal law opinions that consistently used “legal hermeneutics” with the utmost skepticism, even sarcasm, without explanation. The California rule thus even permanently combined the articulation “legal hermeneutics” with the word “legerdemain” as a way of dismissing any argument that on its face appears to be too wordy, convoluted, or without common sense.240 When comparing these cases from New York with those of California, the only common ground shared between them is that the articulation “legal hermeneutics” without even defining it invokes strong passions. For those courts that supported Lieber’s notions, legal hermeneutics is a sophisticatedly philosophically honed mechanism which can act as a referee whenever a dispute over the meaning of a legal text might lead to uncertain application. For the California courts, legal hermeneutics needs no other explanation other than it is a deliberately intimidating and beguiling way of avoiding the truth of the matter. Still, without some affirmation or mention from the courts that distinguishes what sort of legal hermeneutics is referred to, more ambiguity can be formed.

Because all three branches of Lieber’s approach (i.e, Rules of Construction, precedents, and authorities) are now widely accepted, and the dismissive and sarcastic tone of California criminal courts became generally the stance Neo-Conservatives take,241 any mention today of legal hermeneutics could be referring to either of these extremes, although rarely to something else. For stubborn skeptics who might still complain that Continental intellectualism has no place in American law, Lieber’s brief and unorthodox German education at the University of Jena suggests that he must have had access to Continental hermeneutics and German philosophy as they existed in the early 19th-century before bringing these ideas in an important way to America. Thankfully, Gadamer’s Truth and Method also finally finds its way into the courts, if not entirely obliquely.242 In Stupak-Thrall ν. United States, 243 a deadlocked, seven-to-seven en banc Court of Appeals in the Sixth Circuit argued about the meaning of the phrase “subject to valid existing rights” as it applied to Forest Service regulations promulgated from the Michigan Wilderness Act of 1997.244 In light of the tie vote and high passions on both sides of the argument, the impasse ultimately meant the lower court was technically “affirmed” as if no appeal had taken place at all. The court nevertheless memorialized its grandiose non-decision with two vociferously opposing opinions. Judge Karen Nelson Moore (b. 1948), a Clinton appointee, defends the regulations in question which would make rules for sail boats and house boats on even small remote lakes, including one central to the litigation in the upper peninsula of Michigan.245 Judge Danny Julian Boggs (b. 1944), a Reagan appointee, sides with dwellers near the lake who have claimed the rules were interfering with their riparian rights. In a very typical left-right political exchange out of the still young post-Reagan era, Boggs presents a much lengthier opinion (34 pages) than Moore’s (a little more than 3 pages), while simultaneously claiming the case is actually a “very simple” case.246 Towards the end of the opinion, Boggs delivers his version of a coup de grâce by citing five articles in a footnote which he claims are dedicated to the ambiguity in the Constitution concerning whether the President should be 35 years of age (even though only the first article facetiously examines this247). Boggs’s strategy here follows the California criminal courts’ approach to legal hermeneutics: rolling one’s eyes and pretending that some malicious element has infected the otherwise healthy body of law.

By making a broadside attack on “critical legal studies,” even chiding law review commentaries in general based on Moore’s precise mention of a 375-page study by the University of Kentucky studying the ambiguous meaning of “subject to valid existing rights,” Boggs appeals to a populism by citing a survey of articles he probably has not even read. Fortunately, among these articles is a seminal article by Mootz about Gadamer’s legal hermeneutics.248 Although this is no red carpet for Gadamer’s legal hermeneutics to make a grand entrance into American case law on, and Boggs is frailly attempting humor, embellishing the sarcasm of the California criminal courts, it indirectly introduces hermeneutics into American common law as commentary. What Lieber’s name suggests in so many New York legal opinions can law from an early date and are preserved in many of its common law doctrines. Despite this fact, a practicing jurist is still not necessarily compelled to make the connection between Lieber and, say, the cliché of a lawyer quoting a Latin motto when addressing an issue as to how a statute should be interpreted and, in doing so, seeming to end any debate of the statute’s true meaning with the same certainty of the inanimate nature of the dead language employed. Perhaps the certainty of dead language gives an interpreter more confidence, and if the text itself is declared dead, it is more predictable than a “living” text in which meanings change over time. Whether or not the interpretation of a law might stretch outside of a common application of how it might otherwise have been used up to that point in time, the legal hermeneutics rubric serves as simply a reminder that there is nothing licentious or improper about interpreting or constructing upon a preexisting law in a way that has never been tried before. Just the same, the open-minded jurist of today who recognizes something useful about Gadamerian legal hermeneutics ought to beware of the mocking accusations of those like Judge Boggs. This includes the impatient hope that simply mentioning Lieber’s name, let alone Gadamer’s, is all one needs to know in order to start snipping and amending statutes and making sweeping declarations that are supposed to be based on the legal ideas stated within the four corners of a legal opinion. After all, Lieber was able to codify his ideas into a handy list that can be followed step-by-step without much extra explanation.249 On the other hand, what Gadamer represents is no", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634244510_cleaned.txt:37:8138ec17b82a", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 2297, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634244510_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634244510", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634244510_cleaned", "chunk_index": 38, "text": "includes the impatient hope that simply mentioning Lieber’s name, let alone Gadamer’s, is all one needs to know in order to start snipping and amending statutes and making sweeping declarations that are supposed to be based on the legal ideas stated within the four corners of a legal opinion. After all, Lieber was able to codify his ideas into a handy list that can be followed step-by-step without much extra explanation.249 On the other hand, what Gadamer represents is no such pat and simple do-it-yourself manual to interpretation, rather, the result of centuries of German transcendental philosophy combining pregnant concepts mostly out of Classical Antiquity with a freely intuitive “play” (Spiel250) between understanding and interpretation. With that given as the purpose of the “machinery,” the “nuts and bolts” of it are too numerous, difficult to find, and even often difficult to determine to think of hermeneutics as anything so scientifically based as a machine. Compared with the likes of Lieber as a seeming relic of the 19th-century to build on in American law, Gadamer espouses a much larger, expansive picture for legal hermeneutics as to what should be recognized about how language is used generally, as well as specifically in the law, even though this picture basically depicts what has already been commonly practiced. As such, legal hermeneutics consists of a collection of indispensable rules in the form of rehashing ancient concepts for the interpretation of legal language. In America, this has been used to defend interpretations of the Constitution, other legal interpretations in the form of legal opinions, and interpreting duly enacted statutes. Gadamer states explicitly that legal hermeneutics relies on Aristotelian concepts, but especially phronesis, as developed by his mentor Martin Heidegger (1889-1976),251 not to mention as developed by Heidegger and others in contemplation of other historical turning points of Modern Western philosophy, especially the ongoing influence of the cogito, ergo sum argument of René Descartes (1596 − 1650)²⁵² and Immanuel Kant’s (1724-1804) transcendental exploration of how individuals make judgments in general.253 Above all, Gadamer stresses how phronesis involves a decision-making process that is starkly distinct from getting universal results out of scientific methodology, which draws its conclusions based on what Aristotle referred to as episteme (Eεπίστημη)254: as long as the rules can consistently describe phenomena without exceptions, they may conveniently stand as scientific maxims. While episteme in this way distinguishes itself by deriving scientific knowledge based on the combination of inductive reasoning and demonstration, phronesis distinguishes itself in two ways distinct from scientific knowledge: 1) it provides another type of certainty based on inductive reasoning and demonstration, but not necessarily in describing physical phenomena, but in human behavior based on preferring reason to base instincts; and 2) it also does not steer itself by searching for something universal, rather, it stresses the individual’s perception of specific instances.255 The stressing of the individual within its specificity and indispensability", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634244510_cleaned.txt:38:77656c079ad2", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 2298, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634244510_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634244510", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634244510_cleaned", "chunk_index": 39, "text": "the combination of inductive reasoning and demonstration, phronesis distinguishes itself in two ways distinct from scientific knowledge: 1) it provides another type of certainty based on inductive reasoning and demonstration, but not necessarily in describing physical phenomena, but in human behavior based on preferring reason to base instincts; and 2) it also does not steer itself by searching for something universal, rather, it stresses the individual’s perception of specific instances.255 The stressing of the individual within its specificity and indispensability within phronesis has proved an important, but also controversial aspect, when the process ostensibly attempts to do without the individual.256 The process of forming judgments involving phronesis also distinguishes itself from nous (νοΰς, which is Latinized as intellectus), which involves reason and the ability to determine what is true. Both phronesis and nous involve the dianoetic (διανοεϊν) process, which develops a stepby-step method of cognition or argumentation with an often unforeseen outcome, but based on rationality (ratio) and understanding.257 In its purest form with nous, the dianoetic process resembles the proofs of geometry (mos geometricus) and its certainty. The more immediate noetic (νοεϊν) process makes pre-judgments based on first impressions and intuition,258 or, as Gadamer writes extensively about in terms of Heidegger’s “pre-judgment” structure (Vorurteile),259 the immediate notion that our senses pick up on that does not yet require a judgment.260 Reflecting on this now more sophisticated process of cognition and the several steps it takes before getting to understanding, let alone interpretation, Aristotle has described phronesis as the “eye of the soul,” (όμμα της ψυχής),261 concluding that because it may or may not involve following a set pattern of rules, it also has a noetic element to it.262 In other words, common sense can still be a factor when lacking conclusive data (or scientific knowledge) as to whether a left or right turn in a maze leads you out of the puzzle or not. The often employed distinctions in translation of Classical Greek into Latin-based languages, specifically the meaning and various applications of the word “phronesis” in Aristotle’s conception of practical philosophy (πρα̇χν|ς) , as compared to the words “techne” (τέχνη) and “sophia” (σoϕ^(iα)) , reveals a thread that runs through much of modern legal hermeneutics. To illustrate this with a specific example, “phronesis” has been commonly Latinized as “prudentia,” which in American law often helps distinguish a merely “reasonable person” (based purely on νοΰς or intellectus) standard with that of a “reasonably prudent person.” The other Greek concepts fall into more familiar modern language forms: “techne” is often associated with “technique,” while “sophia” usually means “wisdom” (i.e., divine wisdom as opposed to practical wisdom), despite varied and numerous other uses of its original form. Once this prudence can be distinguished from wisdom, technique, episteme or nous, the source of Gadamer’s distinction between legal hermeneutics and a more general philosophical hermeneutics lies deep within the philosophies of Heidegger.

Once this prudence can be distinguished from wisdom, technique, episteme or nous, the source of Gadamer’s distinction between legal hermeneutics and a more general philosophical hermeneutics lies deep within the philosophies of Heidegger. Playing dramatically off of Descartes’s cogito as the essence of modern ontology, Heidegger substitutes Decartes’s generic form of being in “sum” (I am) with a more nuanced form of being in “Da-sein” (which Heidegger stresses as a compound word of the two German words for “there” and “to be”).263 Heidegger then reminds us that ontology or the study of the nature of being has always been accomplished in past philosophy without the consideration of time.264 Adding the time dimension alters ontology into a more appropriate model of the 20th-century universe. Heidegger further develops Da-sein in many cryptic ways, often coining his own German words, compounds and usages, but eventually arrives at one crucial point at the notion that Da-sein is understanding in and of itself.265 Heidegger’s further development of the notion of “facticity” (Faktizität)266 as something deeply related to Aristotle’s and even Augustine’s notion of “anima,”267 supporting this notion of Da-sein as “being thrown” (Geworfenheit)268 as opposed to a stable existence (Vorhandenheit).269 The former represents the living element in understanding. Because Gadamer attempts to unravel as many of Heidegger’s cryptic notions to the best of his knowledge and ability, even simplifying them (substituting, for example, the word “being” for Heidegger’s “Da-sein”), critics such as Jürgen Habermas270 and Vattimo271 have accused him of “urbanizing” Heidegger.272 On the other hand, Gadamer’s status as Heidegger’s student brings forth many observations of an insider before Heidegger’s Sein und Zeit was even published, especially the fact that Gadamer’s interest began with Heidegger’s lectures on Aristotle’s On the Soul (De anima or Περί Ψυχής), early in the 1920s.273 It should also never be taken lightly that in some influential avenues of literature during the 1920s, various experimental and avant-garde styles at the hands of writers such as James Joyce or even Bertolt Brecht were considered important enough to allow cutting-edge thinkers like Heidegger to experiment with prose in his own way. In this context, Heidegger made his next step after linking understanding with Da-sein in the connection between understanding and interpretation (Auslegung).274 Already developed earlier in Sein und Zeit is much about the way “circular reasoning” (Zirkel der Beweis)275 is unavoidable in hermeneutics,276 but also as something which can become “vicious” (vitiosum)277 when the step-by-step process of interpretation employs circular reasoning while ascending one level in an attempt to define another.

Gadamer transformed this purely cognitive notion by Heidegger into a more social notion of a hermeneutical circle,278 although Heidegger had already hinted at this more social notion with his trilogy of concepts known as “with-the-world” (Mitwelt), “being-with” (Mitsein), and “with-Da-sein” (Mitdasein).279 In order to flesh out hermeneutics further, another elusive concept Heidegger employed occurred in his word for “disclosed” (erschlossen), which according to handwritten notes in the margins of Sein und Zeit is associated with the Greek word “άληθεια.”280 One common Latinization of this word is “veritas,” which in English is usually “truth,” but in Greek also encompasses the Aristotelian notion of “something that reveals itself.” In this way, Heidegger’s notes also refer to “Lichtung, Licht, Leuchten,” which in English would be “lighting, light, to lighten.” Although Germans did not have an 18th-century “Enlightenment,” at least not with the symbolism of a light turning on or shedding light on something that was once dark, the German “Aufklärung,” or an announcement, represented more an important decree upon the politics of the time than shedding light upon the dark Medieval mind and its outmoded conundrums. There is certainly nothing in free-thinking society that requires anyone to accept Heidegger, Gadamer, or even Aristotle as an immutable or sacred source of Western thought, and it could just as easily be argued that any lost potency in current legal thinking of a notion of phronesis which originated in Antiquity has nothing to do with neglect, but perhaps with a concerted effort to streamline ancient thought into a more efficient use of otherwise abstract theories. In fact, so many of these concepts out of Classical Antiquity tend to be associated with what are now the “occult sciences,”281 that one tends to assume that these once indispensable philosophical ideas also lack the type of certainty or integrity in methodology required to maintain relevance after the Age of Enlightenment. Certainly science’s efficiency in throwing off once legion rules of how the universe is structured, including the now discarded notion that the world is flat, might consider something like phronesis, with its strong reliance on notions of a soul, to be also not suitable for a worldview now tempered with scientific discipline.

Nonetheless, if the Greeks once had even a slightly different grasp on the human capacity to reason and make judgments as compared to what is generally accepted in the practice of law more than two millennia later, there is no reason to ignore this, especially if at least some recent philosophers are heralding a concept like phronesis as something indispensable to interpretation.282 On the other hand, the Enlightenment’s concern in removing what were now to be declared “pseudo-sciences”—especially pseudo-sciences involving so-called arcane interpretive skills such as phrenology, palmistry, and astrology—out of the recognized and respected canon of knowledge carried with it its own sort of phronesis. The Enlightenment’s phronesis helped redefine what people of good moral character (προαίρεσις) were and how such people should support that science was now dictating a more disciplined approach to accepting what was true and what was false. Now that astronomers only study the arbitrary movement of stars and their purely scientific nature, they would not be distracted from this lofty purpose by also divining “meanings” from them as parts of a Zodiac, influencing the behavior of humans, even though this had been scrupulously “studied” since the Old Babylonian Empire. That the likes of otherwise intelligent people of good moral character (προαίρεσις) like Emanuel Swedenborg and Franz Anton Mesmer could not entirely attain the ideal of this new discipline of the Enlightenment and helped “rediscover” the occult sciences well into the 19^(th) -century, makes for only a slight softening of the otherwise profoundly potent historical and intellectual influence that the Enlightenment had on Western culture. The problem that arises in this context has an unmistakable irony to it: whether an implied mainstream of thinkers espousing textualism and originalism have somehow similarly discarded concepts such as legal hermeneutics (including Aristotle’s phronesis) as if it were mere pseudo-science like astrology and lacked disciplined and rigorous integrity. In this way, the textualists and originalists employ their own unacknowledged form of phronesis to rid the argument of an ancient form of phronesis, all in a simplified but contradictory or even ironic affirmation of tradition. Obviously Heidegger’s philosophical affirmation of even unchartered territory regarding a contemporary application of phronesis, not to mention ontology, resembles in no way the resurrection of what are now occult sciences, because nothing in the post-Enlightenment notion of science suggests that it has anything else to do with the laws of causality and its inductive leap—in other words with Aristotle’s notion of episteme, which is distinct from the concept of making decisions based on a mixture of virtue, reason,", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634244510_cleaned.txt:42:f9eb1096162c", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 2302, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634244510_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634244510", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634244510_cleaned", "chunk_index": 43, "text": "of tradition.

Associating such religious concepts with the purging of pseudo-science that occurred during the Enlightenment proves a baby-with-the-bathwater recklessness, but certainly can be found in some of the tenants of more extreme legal postures such as positivism.284 A major challenge of the Enlightenment came in the form of attempt-ing to create for religious intellectualism a new way of reckoning had never before been encountered in history, because Western culture’s great Holy Book had never before been so upstaged by the accelerating advances of science. Some intellectuals forced themselves to frame the issue as purging out pseudo-science on the one hand, versus blasphemy on the other. Friedrich Schleiermacher (1768-1834) entered the scene in an effort to find—through an entirely new approach to hermeneutics—a scientific certainty (certitudo sine dubitatione285) that once existed in what he perceived to be a traditional interpretation of Biblical texts.286 Because the newly enhanced blossoming natural sciences of Enlightenment all but challenged the more progressive Protestantism of Schleiermacher’s day to find a more progressive way of interpreting Biblical texts,287 the thrust of Schleiermacher’s hermeneutics was primarily theological. As these methods were later developed and the hermeneutical scope was widened by the likes of Wilhelm Dilthey (1833-1911)288 to include all of the humanities, especially art, and even later by Heidegger, the word “hermeneutics” became ubiquitous in philosophical works and left the layperson to sort out a trail of historical practices in exegesis, at least since the Enlightenment. A simple dictionary definition of “hermeneutics” as “to interpret” could hardly suffice to explain the usage in works by Heidegger and other philosophers, linguists, and political scientists. Even though attempts to invent a scientific certainty (such as Schleiermacher’s theology or Dilthey’s aesthetics) probably partake in extreme examples of crossing the wires of episteme and phronesis that textualism or originalism attempt to do, Schleiermacher and Dilthey’s attempts still helped lay the groundwork for Heidegger to shed new light on the divide between episteme and phronesis as well as other aspects of legal hermeneutics.

The fact that the U.S. Constitution was also one of the crown jewels of the Enlightenment movement289 demonstrates that this era was not only a revolution of strengthening and purifying episteme. The fact that thinkers like Lieber associated his own version of legal hermeneutics with the Enlightenment speaks to the idea that democracy almost by definition requires a sophisticated philosophy of hermeneutics behind it never conceived in monarchies. Under any rudimentary monarchy systems, a king who both decrees the laws of a nation or tribe and then interprets them as well whenever they were in the king’s opinion broken is completely free of any need of hermeneutics, according to its traditional practice. The king thinks he knows what he meant by the decree while decreeing it, and then simply “knows” when someone disobeys his decree, even if the disobedience was something he did not think about when making the decree. Borrowing from Ricœur’s terminology of a text without metaphors as “rhetoric degree zero,”290 a decree by a king who also enforces his own decree could be a “legal decree degree zero.” Such a king’s interpretation of his own rule might involve his own private dianoetic process, and maybe this involves his own private phronesis, but if not, the king is free to make any kneejerk reaction to a citizen’s “disobedience” at his own pleasure. When a law is written or decreed by someone not available to explain how it should be enforced, the enforcer must accept the imperfection of not knowing precisely what the king or legislator meant when the law was decreed. When the law is included in a book of laws designated as a holy book, it is much easier to accept that even when interpretation is required of a law, the perfection of a divine author provides the belief in one certain and perfect true meaning that would function perfectly as a law in society were the imperfect humans capable of interpreting it correctly. This has found its way into 20th-century China in the form of Chairman Mao’s infamous “Little Red Book.”291 Certainly America shared deep intellectual sentiments with (along with the language of) England, depicting its newly drafted Constitution in the context of a forward-looking, even quintessential symbolism of the Enlightenment, but finding less influence from France, Germany and other Continental approaches to law—despite the important influences on early America of these countries.

While American jurists grew more confident interpreting the laws of their new land instead of the decrees of kings, contemplation about what the legislators were intending with such laws would undoubtedly require contemplation of the intents of everyone who voted for the law, not simply the law’s author. Even Justice Scalia criticizes consideration of the legislators’ intent, although he generously considers “writings” such as James Madison’s The Federalist to help explain how the Constitution was understood.292 Meanwhile, Continental Europe was developing hermeneutics as an approach to interpreting both language and phenomenology itself through a traditional form of philosophy that was at first all but inaccessible to America, but was undoubtedly also aligned with the Enlightenment, albeit in a different way.293 When considering that extensive approaches to interpreting texts have been examined throughout history, especially in the Pre-Enlightenment world,294 somehow any new approach to interpretation took on the character in America of something suspicious and foreign, if not an occult science altogether. Nonetheless, Continental Europe also harbored suspicions about interpreting laws as reflected in several of its burgeoning Civil Codes. Such codes also demonstrate how embellishing laws by further interpreting them somehow goes against a traditional view that recognizes a weakness, if not a mischief, that justifies flouting them.295 Fundamental Christian notions that there should be no interpretation of the myriad rules of the Bible also famously show how the traditional practice of accepting laws as simple texts that ought not be embellished is a notion that has survived throughout history, even if there might be a naiveté attached to it. When the original currents of the Enlightenment played out into the full-blown Romanticism of the 19th-century, Kant’s concept of the “power of judgment” (Urteilskraft)296 allowed philosophers to revisit something more concrete, developing further by the 20th-century into a much more expanded notion of hermeneutics, which relied so much on Kant that many in the era called it a “Neo-Kantian” movement. Heidegger borrows from the Neo-Kantians’ distinction of a schema for understanding as part of an ongoing understanding of reality and how it plays out in history.297 More succinctly, this distinction between an ontic and historic reality became an art hidden in the depths of the human soul (verborgene Kunst in den Tiefen der menschlichen Seele).298 No matter how carefully written a text is with the purpose of creating a rule that is universal, or at least a rule understandable enough", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634244510_cleaned.txt:45:6999142f0bc8", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 2305, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634244510_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634244510", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634244510_cleaned", "chunk_index": 46, "text": "Heidegger borrows from the Neo-Kantians’ distinction of a schema for understanding as part of an ongoing understanding of reality and how it plays out in history.297 More succinctly, this distinction between an ontic and historic reality became an art hidden in the depths of the human soul (verborgene Kunst in den Tiefen der menschlichen Seele).298 No matter how carefully written a text is with the purpose of creating a rule that is universal, or at least a rule understandable enough that another person pledged to follow it to the letter cannot possibly make any aberration to its original intent, an interpretation can always be devised that can follow the rule, but run directly opposite to the intention. In this way, writing a law is not unlike confronting any mathematical system for which ultimate perfection is impossible, as is so aptly and popularly depicted in the book Gödel, Escher, and Bach. 299 Originally, the most fundamental rule of legal hermeneutics is what Schleiermacher also believed for theological hermeneutics, that is, that there could only be one “true” interpretation of a text, or universal hermeneutics.300 Lieber produces several examples of laws deliberately disobeyed according to their original intent but without violating the literal “letter of the law.”301 Most notably, the Medieval story involving King Conrad III and his royal decree to the women living in the Castle at Weinsberg intended to spare them the slaughter that awaited their husbands by allowing them to leave with whatever personal property they could carry on their backs.302 The clever women proceeded to exit the castle carrying their husbands on their backs. To take an example just the opposite of the women of Weinsberg, that is, a law that when meticulously followed tends to directly violate a public policy the law was intended to preserve, Justice Scalia uses the case of Church of the Holy Trinity v. United States. 303 In that case, a prominent, historical church in New York City attempted to hire an Englishman to be its rector and pastor, even though a statute forbade American citizens from encouraging aliens to migrate to the United States. Although Scalia admits the statute was probably overbroad and was intended to halt an influx of foreign manual labor into America, which is how the Court in that case justified their decision to allow the Church to hire the Englishman, Scalia also gives this example of a classic case of how the Court got it “wrong and failed to follow the text.”304 Meanwhile, the modern notions of texualism and originalism305, which also attempt to debunk modern legal hermeneutics and vice versa, certainly already includes this early notion of “intent of the lawmaker” in it. Whereas originalism deals with interpreting the Constitution, another recent movement of austerity of interpretation known as textualism deals with statutes. Ultimately, these concepts challenge precariously what Aquinas referred to as “fides informis,” or faith", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634244510_cleaned.txt:46:20186bf5e53c", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 2306, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634244510_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634244510", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634244510_cleaned", "chunk_index": 47, "text": "case of how the Court got it “wrong and failed to follow the text.”304 Meanwhile, the modern notions of texualism and originalism305, which also attempt to debunk modern legal hermeneutics and vice versa, certainly already includes this early notion of “intent of the lawmaker” in it. Whereas originalism deals with interpreting the Constitution, another recent movement of austerity of interpretation known as textualism deals with statutes. Ultimately, these concepts challenge precariously what Aquinas referred to as “fides informis,” or faith without love,306 because what is implied by the austerity of originalism or textualism is that we must remain emotionally neutral when interpreting law and if the outcome of the interpretation is something that does not please us, the law must still stand without questioning it. This touches again upon the misperception that the only trustworthy text is a dead text. In order to further examine this dispute between texualism and orginalism and legal hermeneutics, it is necessary to further develop the argument, perhaps with an example, since both seemingly rest on a common foundation. ertainly Justice Antonin Scalia’s famous use of both the textualism Cand orginalism lines of reasoning serves as a good example of not only the Neo-Conservative ideal of jurisprudence, but also, contradictorily, as an active effort at interpretation based on scrupulous use of a rule. But Scalia’s rule goes much further than putting into play the tether between what a law tends to mean on its face to a living reader and what that same law was supposed to have meant when it was written by its now dead author(s). In fact, as a textualist interpreter of statutes, he advocates “objectified intent”307 in a way that not only severs the tether to the living, but to the intent of the dead legislator(s) as well. With this alone, a neutral observer might expect to observe at least some similarities between Scalia’s approach to making rules of interpretation and that of a hermeneut such as Gadamer, because both are involved with divining rules as to how a text is interpreted. On the other hand, Gadamer’s approach involves a ubiquitous element of phronesis that allows an interpretation to grow as if it were alive. At the outset of his philosophy, Scalia declares interpretation a “science,”308 although distinguishes this process from that of making common law, which is an “art” of distinguishing older cases.309 He then admits that he only knows of one treatise that explains statutory interpretation as a science.310 This approach shares certain sentiments with positivism—or its related philosophies naturalism and logical positivism.311 It also favors mostly arcane historical research and using it as the source and context of a law— not what the legislator thought the statute meant, let alone what a living reader might think it means. Like Scalia’s textualism, positivism attempts to rid from enforcement of law a sentimentalism that tends to make the rules ultimately", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634244510_cleaned.txt:47:b99b570500e7", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 2307, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634244510_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634244510", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634244510_cleaned", "chunk_index": 48, "text": "of one treatise that explains statutory interpretation as a science.310 This approach shares certain sentiments with positivism—or its related philosophies naturalism and logical positivism.311 It also favors mostly arcane historical research and using it as the source and context of a law— not what the legislator thought the statute meant, let alone what a living reader might think it means. Like Scalia’s textualism, positivism attempts to rid from enforcement of law a sentimentalism that tends to make the rules ultimately too flexible in light of changing norms in the course of history. This flexibility is associated with a sort of laziness312 which might have mistakenly failed to set a standard in America for statutory interpretation, running the risk of distorting the meaning of a text over time, even since its inception. Naturalism is similar in this pursuit against alleged laziness in what it perceives to be a lack of discipline in understanding the natural sciences and how once and for all these sciences have toppled the false conundrums of pseudo-science and superstition.313 The lack of sentiment that positivism can often lead to appears to fuel Naturalism as well. Meanwhile, hermeneuts also fend off what they might perceive as another sort of laziness in thinkers such as Scalia, Bork, and Berger, in that the ancient traditions of interpreting laws and how laws should be preserved have always involved maintaining a tether between present context and past—even if kings were interpreting their own laws. Part of the purpose of law—whether ancient or current—is to assuage the violated sentiments of the general public (the so-called retributive purpose). Whether this general public uses the courts for civil disputes, for which litigants expect a just resolution, or becomes entangled as a victim or defendant in criminal cases, for which criminals are expected to be punished appropriately, the law is for their sentiments, not a judge’s own ability to fend off sentimentalism. In this rather ironic way, both textualists and hermeneuts are engaged in extensive analysis of the meanings of words and articulations that appear in legal language. That textualists or positivists might claim they follow an extreme “plain-meaning” interpretation of whatever text might appear as a legal decree, they are still applying rules of construction. As far as originalism goes, which deals exclusively with interpreting the Constitution, Scalia takes a different tack. Most vividly as opposed to textualism, Scalia’s originalism does embrace the premise that modern jurists must take into consideration intent of the legislator(s) and historical context.314 Scalia denies this consideration is actually reverence to the intent of the legislator, because phrases of the Constitution are still subject to the “objectified intent” of textualism, but admits the Constitution is a broader outline of how to make laws, and therefore requires more historical context as a guide.315 It is also important to understand that Scalia admits that in the common law tradition, judges properly created", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634244510_cleaned.txt:48:2ad0e3a838f4", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 2308, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634244510_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634244510", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634244510_cleaned", "chunk_index": 49, "text": "modern jurists must take into consideration intent of the legislator(s) and historical context.314 Scalia denies this consideration is actually reverence to the intent of the legislator, because phrases of the Constitution are still subject to the “objectified intent” of textualism, but admits the Constitution is a broader outline of how to make laws, and therefore requires more historical context as a guide.315 It is also important to understand that Scalia admits that in the common law tradition, judges properly created laws to fit the situation, even employing to the word “practical” (a word associated with Aristotle’s phronesis) to describe the process.316 Scalia distinguishes this common law “practical” process when a king was involved in government, with the authority of judges in a democracy—judges simply do not have the same authority to make common law when legislators have created a statute.317 In an age in which the U.S. Constitution falls prey to an enticing illusion which by lazy habit finds liberal-minded jurists and the general public applying modern language and context to older language and context, perhaps even for populist purposes, Scalia represents a stern and thin-lipped approach to jurisprudence in general. Unfortunately the only way Scalia’s originalism by and large looks both forward and backward is by indicating how today’s jurists misinterpret the older law. At center is the assumption that the older lawmakers not only did not conceive of the present context in which their laws now still exist in, but often could not even possibly have imagined it. One of the most cited examples of Scalia’s practice of the originalism philosophy is how he interpreted the Eighth Amendment, specifically, the “cruel and unusual punishment” language, in Harmelin v. Michigan. 318 There, Scalia wrote an opinion denying the appeal of a man who had been sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole for possession of a little over 650 grams of cocaine. Because the Constitution requires that an improper punishment be both “cruel” and “unusual,”319 and life in prison is a common (i.e., not “unusual”) form of punishment, the issue in Harmelin became whether the Eighth Amendment included a “proportionality” element to it (no need to analyze “cruel” here, because if “unusual” flunks, the whole test flunks). Scalia argued it did not and even overruled an earlier three-part proportionality test established only eight years earlier in Solem v. Helm. 320 Scalia’s opinion relies on a 1969 article by a Harvard graduate named Anthony Granucci.321 Although Granucci admits that the drafting of the early bills of rights in the early American colonies, including Virginia’s Declaration of Rights which the U.S. Constitution relied on, was “imitative, deficient, and irrationally selective,”322 he goes on to painstakingly demonstrate that the actual source of the articulation “cruel and unusual” in the Eighth Amendment was a minority statement of the House of Lords to a petition submitted to them by a Protestant", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634244510_cleaned.txt:49:ce6caa0fd99e", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 2309, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634244510_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634244510", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634244510_cleaned", "chunk_index": 50, "text": "article by a Harvard graduate named Anthony Granucci.321 Although Granucci admits that the drafting of the early bills of rights in the early American colonies, including Virginia’s Declaration of Rights which the U.S. Constitution relied on, was “imitative, deficient, and irrationally selective,”322 he goes on to painstakingly demonstrate that the actual source of the articulation “cruel and unusual” in the Eighth Amendment was a minority statement of the House of Lords to a petition submitted to them by a Protestant cleric named Titus Oates.323 Only a few years later, this articulation was included verbatim in the English Bill of Rights of 1689. Granted, tracking the source of what would ultimately become mere “boilerplate”324 language for the drafting of bills of rights in the early American colonies would entail unavoidably juggling a lot of minor historical events from England. With very little evidence of what lawyers knew when language was copied from an old official document into a new bill of rights, Granucci and Scalia still focus on what the words might generally mean in the context of Oates’s situation. Probably 18th-century lawyers did not have before them a neat and tidy comprehensive overview of all usages of the legal ideas of “cruel punishments,” let alone “unusual punishments.” Nonetheless, by the time the articulation “cruel and unusual” had been added to the U.S. Constitution as inspired by the Virginians, it was 100 years old. Because Scalia is convinced that ^(α)[m] ost historians agree that”325 the “cruel and unusual” articulation stemmed from the “English Declaration [sic] of Rights,”326 it must specifically refer to the Oates matter. He even implies that although lawyers who copied the language from one document to the next when drafting their bills of rights or other possible now lost documents had probably never heard of Oates, there is a sort of kernel of legality passed on via stare decisis which properly steers the true meaning of the phrase as employed today in a modern Detroit cocaine bust. Oates’s tale harkens back to special penalties invented by George Jeffreys, 1st Baron of Jeffreys (1645-1689), of the King’s Bench during the reign of the Catholic King James II. Baron Jeffreys’s unpopular misdeeds were aimed at making right Oates’s misdeeds in creating a hoax of a conspiracy by Catholics to kill the then Protestant King.327 Oates had thus been found guilty by Jeffreys of a crime of mere perjury, even though it had led to the deaths of 15 Catholics.328 By law, Jeffreys could not sentence Oates to death for perjury, but invented a series of punishments that would in essence, so claim certain historians that Scalia cited,329 serve as a substitute for death. In many ways, Jeffreys was engaging in the same type of roundabout interpretation that the wives of Weinsberg engaged in against King Conrad.330 In fact, Jeffreys was engaging in what the conservative parable of “going outside the", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634244510_cleaned.txt:50:672276750da4", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 2310, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634244510_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634244510", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634244510_cleaned", "chunk_index": 51, "text": "it had led to the deaths of 15 Catholics.328 By law, Jeffreys could not sentence Oates to death for perjury, but invented a series of punishments that would in essence, so claim certain historians that Scalia cited,329 serve as a substitute for death. In many ways, Jeffreys was engaging in the same type of roundabout interpretation that the wives of Weinsberg engaged in against King Conrad.330 In fact, Jeffreys was engaging in what the conservative parable of “going outside the dots” is supposed to prohibit, not to mention originalism itself: bending the law as written to fit what a judge in the context of the moment deems appropriate. Furthermore, Scalia even specifies that any “vicious punishments” during these “Bloody Assizes”331 were authorized by common law, such as “drawing and quartering, burning of women felons, beheading, disemboweling, etc.”332 In other words, as long as methods of torture are part of common law, they are certainly not unusual, no matter how cruel, and because the Eighth Amendment includes the word “and,” the method must be unusual before it can be in any way unconstitutional. While Scalia spent much time in Harmelin trying to determine that the words “cruel and unusual,” even as a textual matter, would only include unusual types of punishment (i.e., against common law), the most important aspect of the case is that this in no way referred to an unusual proportionality of a punishment (i.e., life in prison for possession of 650 grams of cocaine, even when a first offense).333 Whatever Scalia wanted the word “proportionality” to mean in this context, the ultimate gist of Jeffreys’s decree appears to be that among the many punishments heaped upon Oates, only one of them, i.e., defrocking him, should have been deemed unusual, because it was the only punishment that should have been employed by the church, and, therefore, the state had no right to interfere. In addition to this, it was an unusual punishment that had never been a punishment for perjury. Oates—life in prison, among other public humiliations), Jeffreys was not allowed to initially give Oates the death penalty—based generally on the same philosophy of proportionality and due process that Scalia addresses later in his Harmelin opinion. The unusualness of using the death penalty for a charge of perjury in the 1600s is a matter of proportionality, because, based on Scalia’s own argument, there was nothing unusual about the death penalty in common law. Meanwhile, Oates’s case in no way involved some of the more Medieval methods of torture left to the imagination here, other than whipping and a regular appearance in the pillory.334 Even if “most historians” (as per Scalia’s uncited presumption335) consider the words “cruel and unusual” to mean something that excludes a proportionality test based on what the words were originally intended to portray, as well as its subsequent historical usage, Scalia acknowledges his opponents in recognizing", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634244510_cleaned.txt:51:fea7747953b1", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 2311, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634244510_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634244510", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634244510_cleaned", "chunk_index": 52, "text": "penalty in common law.

In fact, Scalia still affirms at the end of his opinion in Harmelin that “required mitigation” (clearly using what otherwise seems to be proportionality as to severity of a crime before it deserves the death penalty) is properly part of the death penalty jurisprudence as per “cruel and unusual,” especially the appeals process of death penalty cases based on the Eighth Amendment as to proportionality. Nonetheless, for Scalia, this is still not necessarily based on an exception, but on the “unique”336 nature of the death penalty, along with the two varieties of life-in-prison sentences: with or without the possibility of parole. Scalia anticipates the argument from opponents that mitigating whether to apply the death penalty or not belongs to a scale that measures severity. Any such measure of severity therefore involves a proportionality factor whenever a death penalty is appealed based on the Eighth Amendment.337 Not only this, Scalia goes on to rate the severity of the three most severe punishments: the death penalty being the most severe; life in prison without the possibility of parole is the second most severe; and life in prison with the possibility of parole is third most severe.338 Even though this could be the start of a top-ten “most severe punishment” list and therefore a proportionality test, Scalia wriggles out of the trap by claiming that these are three distinct punishments that happen to be able to be rated together in severity. In using the word “unique” artfully and according to its correct definition, that is, meaning “something that there is only one of,” Scalia first disqualifies all three of these punishments as being anything that a scale could be used to measure. If it is unique, there is only one of it, and therefore it cannot be compared to anything else—therefore no proportionality. On the other hand, if the two types of life in prison are not proportional, Harmelin would have a case that the Eighth Amendment should apply. Therefore, in the final sentence of the opinion, Scalia backtracks and then “draws the line”339 at the death penalty, after reminding us that “flexible techniques” in the sentencing reduction process (such as executive clemency or legislative changes) make even life sentences proportional to any other sentence.

In this way, by claiming the uniqueness of the death penalty is proportionality as the only proportionality test under “cruel and unusual,” Harmelin remains safely outside the jurisdiction of the Eighth Amendment, because life in prison without parole would involve a proportionality test other than the unique death penalty proportionality.340 With a touch of religious irony, this conclusion also skirts precariously around the original proportionality ethic of the Judeo-Christian culture of lex talionis, or an “eye for an eye,”341 despite Scalia’s strong Catholicism. Nonetheless, it appears that much of the power in the words of originalism derive not from the meaning of the words themselves, but simply from the fact that extensive research into the history of certain lingual phrases provides us with an unexpected explanation of their source. Originalists like Scalia go on to argue that a judge must honor such historical sources as a remote, almost subliminal form of stare decisis. That “cruel and unusual” is also used in Justice Thurgood Marshall’s dissent in Harmelin as grounds to find the death penalty unconstitutional altogether, demonstrates that Scalia’s elaborate explanation about original meaning has by no means silenced any opponents. Also noteworthy is the lack of similar harsh originalism in Scalia’s defense of the right to own guns in his Second Amendment interpretation in District of Columbia v. Heller. 342 In fact, it is nothing less than an amateurish mistake in the study of anything that involves past usages and events, whether it is philology, genealogy, musicology, philosophy, or especially law, to assume that however words and phrases are employed over the centuries, the changes that inevitably occur in their meaning are somehow related to a laziness that must to the best of the ability of living scholars be corrected. Ricœur had a similar battle against logical positivists to exonerate usage of the metaphor in language.343 As an example, allow the title of a famous novel by Robert Louis Stevenson to demonstrate that our legal world does not suffer, is not inefficient, is not inarticulate, is not unscholarly, and most definitely is not lazy if it continues to refer to the crime of kidnapping as any asportation by force of another, typically for a ransom (originally, the crime referred to forcing someone onto a ship in an effort to take them out of the country for the purpose of involuntary servitude).344 Moreover, the originalism argument might raise the same sort of question that the issue of fides informis raises in theology: is there", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634244510_cleaned.txt:53:2b431373cdb9", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 2313, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634244510_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634244510", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634244510_cleaned", "chunk_index": 54, "text": "not inarticulate, is not unscholarly, and most definitely is not lazy if it continues to refer to the crime of kidnapping as any asportation by force of another, typically for a ransom (originally, the crime referred to forcing someone onto a ship in an effort to take them out of the country for the purpose of involuntary servitude).344 Moreover, the originalism argument might raise the same sort of question that the issue of fides informis raises in theology: is there a faith in the law here without an essential living element, that in theology is referred to as a “faith without love.”345 Ultimately, this argument does have merit against originalism, even from a more secular point of view. Whatever charm Neo-Conservatives have in demonstrating a love and respect for the past among friends of like mind often strikes other observers as indulgent and shallow paternalism. Rescuing certain facts from obscurity and putting them on display inside of a legal opinion of the Supreme Court may create its own sort of historical curiosity for all time, but as binding law preserved by stare decisis, these curiosities also share something with the experience of a carnival where relics and oddities of the past continue their relevance to modern times by being displayed in jars of formaldehyde. Without outright questioning the originalists’ motives—mo-Neo-Conservative goal of limiting the role of the Federal government—a hermeneut eventually might reluctantly agree that if Scalia is appealing to his own sense of phronesis and is in good faith seeing the world the way that is reflected in his opinions, there is little to criticize further about his logic from a hermeneutical point of view. He is in fact his own version of a hermeneut, and, as a duly appointed judge, his iconoclastic interpretation of the law stands, even if he is paradoxically criticizing judges for legislating from the bench at the same time. Although a personal acknowledgement of phronesis is by no means license to project whatever meaning to a law might be convenient to achieve something from an entirely different agenda, the fallacy of questioning someone’s motives bases itself on the assumption that the critic is trying to prove that the other person’s argument is “wrong.” If Scalia believes his own arguments, as shortsighted as they may be, questioning the motives of a Neo-Conservative judge nevertheless does not prove his arguments are “wrong.” Nonetheless, Gadamer’s indirect voice as a critic of the burgeoning world of originalism during the 1970s did not come without a proviso provided from another prominent voice from Continental Europe. In 1967, Habermas had expressed his own argument against Gadamer in terms of his way of using hermeneutics resting on the prejudices that are formed by culture and tradition, including what is commonly considered authority. At one crucial point in his argument, Habermas adamantly opposed any convergence between “authority” and “understanding” (Authorität und Erkenntnis", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634244510_cleaned.txt:54:9dbff8dd8b2a", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 2314, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634244510_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634244510", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634244510_cleaned", "chunk_index": 55, "text": "as a critic of the burgeoning world of originalism during the 1970s did not come without a proviso provided from another prominent voice from Continental Europe.

At one crucial point in his argument, Habermas adamantly opposed any convergence between “authority” and “understanding” (Authorität und Erkenntnis konvergieren nicht).346 Some onlookers looking to simplify the situation have even allowed a very rough interpretation of this row as Habermas criticizing Gadamer as a student of Heidegger, when embedded deep inside the latter’s philosophy must have been some sort of distorted sympathy for Nazi ideology.347 Although this gross simplification might even portray Habermas as somehow representing the liberal, or even Marxist, point of view, complete with the association that he is from Frankfurt am Main, and the Frankfurt School (Horkheimer, Adorno, and others),348 the dispute still stands today as a form of pure philosophical impasse, sanitized from any “real existing” pernicious events from history such as Nazis or Communists. Introducing Ricœur’s notion “hermeneutics of suspicion” (les hermé- neutiques du soupçon349) at this point may not lend clarity to the relationship between hermeneutics and originalism, but Ricœur did intend to show that behind the Habermas-Gadamer contretemps was the same inquisitive scholarship that led Marx, Nietzsche, and Freud into their directions of questioning (or being suspicious of) a status quo. Meanwhile, Scalia’s point of view is just as suspicious of the status quo as these three were (if not more). Using Marx, Nietzsche, and Freud as muses in this pursuit has drawbacks, because these figures still unfortunately incite controversy. Meanwhile, Ricœur’s triumvirate of “suspicious” thinkers had their own subliminal forces to their philosophies, suggesting they were driven more by a mixture of suspicion and faith, than turning away from tradition: for Marx, it was the obvious but unacknowledged influence of Christian charity in sharing; for Nietzsche, it was the genuine and ongoing conflict which he only partially acknowledged in weaning himself from what he saw as a vulgarization of Germanic tradition by his childhood idol, composer Richard Wagner350; and for Freud, it was the unacknowledged influence of the writings of the Marquis de Sade, whose 1788 short story “Florville et Courval, ou le Fatalisme”351 portrays the Oedipus complex long before any fin-de-siècle Viennese influences had taken shape. As merely affirming a deliberate methodology to attain a hidden intention behind what might otherwise appear to be spontaneous, Ricœur’s observations did not take sides between Gadamer and Habermas. He saw the difference between the two modern German minds with roots in a horrible German past as an opportunity to settle something larger. Nonetheless, Ricœur employs the concept of “distanciation”353 into this dialogue, referring here to the alienation of an individual to tradition.

He saw the difference between the two modern German minds with roots in a horrible German past as an opportunity to settle something larger. Nonetheless, Ricœur employs the concept of “distanciation”353 into this dialogue, referring here to the alienation of an individual to tradition. This was the state of mind, he says, in which Marx, Nietzsche, and Freud, not to mention to some degree Habermas, prepared their philosophies in order to break free from a “false consciousness”354 of their day. Even though Heidegger had his own ideas about this concept (Verfremdung or Seinsvergessenheit355), his student Gadamer’s philosophy revolves around the importance of a sense of “belonging” (Zughörigkeit356) to tradition, according to Ricœur. Although these stances ostensibly are supposed to conflict with one another, both Gadamer and Ricœur reveal that their methods involve several different steps of giving and taking, so that there really should not be any discord between these notions of alienation and belonging. Interestingly enough, Gadamer also spoke about a concept of “belonging” in connection with Aristotle’s notion of the theater, and how the listener tunes into the drama by losing a sense of reality.357 It was Bertolt Brecht (1898-1956) who made famous his concept of theater diametrically opposed to Aristotle’s in the “alienation effect” (Verfremdungseffekt or V-effekt), hoping his theater-goers would be completely disoriented and not be able to identify with the character on stage.358 Marx also used a similar term (Entfremdung359) to describe the general isolation of the worker to the products of his work. It is also important to point out that in German, the word “Fremd” emphasizes something especially foreign or removed from culture or tradition. Suffice it to say, there is certainly a wide chasm between how Gadamer distinguishes the quality of being “foreign,” when the text involved actually needs to be translated,360 and the quality in theater that Brecht was striving for, symbolic of many things: from alienation of the classes in the political world; to the beauty achieved in Japanese theater by alienating the actors from the audience.361 Habermas uses the concept of “alienation” (Verfremdung362) to distinguish reflective understanding from the everyday understanding subscribed by positivism that leads to false objectification of an experience in reality. In this, Habermas and Gadamer appear to agree, as Habermas goes on to explain that the “truth” (Wahrheit) and “method” (Methode) in the title of Gadamer’s book represent the joining of the philosophical and scientific.363 That Ricœur steps into this by forming his own sense in “distanciation,” that appears to borrow more from Marx than any of the other references, as something as opposed to tradition and therefore shut off from the culture that custom and tradition are the results", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634244510_cleaned.txt:56:e8e26db8ed36", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 2316, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634244510_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634244510", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634244510_cleaned", "chunk_index": 57, "text": "In this, Habermas and Gadamer appear to agree, as Habermas goes on to explain that the “truth” (Wahrheit) and “method” (Methode) in the title of Gadamer’s book represent the joining of the philosophical and scientific.363 That Ricœur steps into this by forming his own sense in “distanciation,” that appears to borrow more from Marx than any of the other references, as something as opposed to tradition and therefore shut off from the culture that custom and tradition are the results of, affirms alienation without embracing it. The result of this is the “false consciousness,” which in the case of Freud especially, implies that some other secret agenda is lurking subliminally. That embracing tradition can lead to a sense of belonging that can indeed be false actually does sum up what Habermas might have been criticizing Gadamer for. Ricœur’s hermeneutics succeed in providing a more complete picture for the next generation of hermeneuts, who actually found renewed interest in Marx, Nietzsche, and Freud and their applications as steps in the hermeneutical process. In a word of caution, it also strangely encourages conspiracy theorists, who by habit always question what they are told in the form of an “official version.” In all these ways, Scalia also works to combat his own sense of false consciousness by distancing himself from the status quo—what he sees as a lazy and undeveloped sense of statutory and constitutional interpretation. Like Brecht, his opinions often deliberately alienate the reader by appealing to obscure historical events, when all along such illustrations serve mostly to allow the judge to disqualify himself as not having the authority from a Democratic government to legislate from the bench—and, also like Brecht, filled with plenty of drama and theatrical effect. Despite what Scalia assures us is the popular mandate, most voters in this Democracy during the 1980s were probably unaware that access to the courts with genuine injustices might cease, based on a Justice’s unemotional ruling that there is no longer a power to the court that existed when common law was first formed in England centuries ago. Indeed, Neo-Conservatives proved themselves as the same sort of iconoclasts as Marx, Nietzsche, and Freud, but the hermeneut still wonders about the foundation that Scalia’s views rest on—namely that a text can ever be dead, beyond interpretation. Ultimately, textualism and orginalism must make the distinction between alienation and simply being on display as a dead object.

Aside from its general definition to mean anything occurring pres-ently, the word “modernism” as describing some sort of trendin thinking and activity usually starkly compares and contrasts something old (unmodern) with something new (modern). Because the old usually is familiar, the new is introduced as something strange and even at times counterintuitive. Different versions of modernism also compete with each other, since historically only one true path of thinking into the future will prevail. By now, most people recognize certain crucial moments in history that radically changed the old way of looking at things, what was until then a normal way of looking at things. For example, when it was discovered that the world was round and not flat, this formerly counterintuitive notion radically altered everyone’s perception of reality. At that point, there was an urgency that everyone accept the new modern way of looking at things. In other words, in order to be a modern human being, it was necessary to adopt this new way of thinking. In the 20th-century especially, this urgency drove many different new ideas, such as evolution, Einstein’s Theory of Relativity, Freud, Marxism, as well as in some circles new approaches to faith, which average people did not fully understand but could be convinced were new ways of thinking superior to the old ways—new ways of thinking that had to be accepted in order to be modern or “up to date.” This faith in the new often allowed critics to claim that modernism suffered from a sort of “Emperor’s new clothes” syndrome: everyone claimed to understand the importance of the new ideas without really understanding them at all. More importantly, there was a sense to modernism that “well enough could not be left alone” or that perfectly functional and competent ideas were being tinkered with in the spirit of making them more “modern.” This was especially true in the field of art, because the old art was being preserved and enjoyed in a substantial new way via modern printing, audio recording, and eventually computers. At times, the tendency to experiment made certain perfectly functional ideas more complicated and esoteric than it appeared to the layperson they needed to be. In fact, postmodernism itself often became driven by the same urgency and forces as a new way of thinking that people now had to adopt. This was one of many contradictions that postmodernism always inherently and stubbornly preserved, no matter how ardently the thinker acting as theorist claimed to understand this new way of thinking.

Whether an era called “modernism” began in the Renaissance,364 the Age of Enlightenment, the early 20th-century, or whether it even existed as an “era” at all but more as an ongoing way of thinking does not matter. New modern ideas that radically advance civilization go back to the discovery of fire. What does matter is the universal notion of supporting the advancement of civilization by finding ever more new ideas that will improve and even replace the old ideas. In fact, the instinct to conquer one’s foe, especially if that foe is an old and oppressive empire, is one of the oldest universal notions in history—a longing for one’s ethnicity or country to be so great that it will conquer the world. Various disciplines have adopted the term “postmodernism” to mean of regress, symbolic or otherwise, in the urgency to develop and advance new ideas. In architecture during the 1940s, it referred to using human contours in a building rather than the prevailing square, machine metaphors of buildings of the early 20th-century like the Empire State Building.365 During the 1960s, music adopted the term to refer to the end of a necessity to find new styles, allowing musical collages consisting of old styles, pastiche, and a general blurring between high-brow and low-brow cultures.366 In philosophy, the old rigid process of legitimation of scientific maxims has been softened in light of the game of language that cannot be avoided to describe it, but also the prospect that computers will provide scientific discoveries and store them as information.367 Although postmodernism is different in this clearly non-exhaustive list of the three above examples, there is a common thread: in architecture, using the machine metaphor in designing buildings represents a technologically pure system with all of the certainty and rigidity that properly functioning machinery provides; in music, there is no ultimate prevailing style (system of music) representing the most advanced style, corresponding to the mechanical accuracy and certainty in architecture; and in philosophy, understanding the ultimate scientific system can only be through the imperfections of language, which require tolerance for many explanations of smaller phenomena without even attempting a single, universal explanation for how it all fits in the macrocosm. The regress in all three examples away from finding a new and improved system (if not once and for all a perfect system) leads to almost a surrender to continue the older imperfect systems even if in a contradictory, counterintuitive way.

Although there are as many possible starting points as to when postmodernism began, the year 1975 is probably more convenient than most, corresponding roughly with the end of the Vietnam War. At this point in time, the Liberal voice in America shifted radically, because it had to adapt a new way of thinking without the convenience of the continuing injustice of this unpopular war. The already named but amorphously defined entity called postmodern philosophy served as some sort of heir apparent to fill the void. In light of the more narrow (modern) affirmation of capitalism in the looming Libertarian and Neo-Conservative currents of that time, it certainly did not have to be out of step with the diversity of postmodernism, as long as the postmodernist is considering all the points of view available in his or her landscape, even if they happen to fall into older ones following the more modern ideal. The allure of postmodernism is at the same time the very problem with it: it focuses on the unavoidable contradictions inherent in reality as represented by language by contradicting itself. No one in their right mind could ever actually believe that when the Berlin Wall fell in 1989 that Francis Fukuyama’s postmodern statement that it represented the “end of history”368 somehow meant that time itself stopped ticking. So does postmodernism even exist? he most notable outcome of postmodernism as applied to law is Ta change in the way the Rule of Law has required a consistent and universal application and enforcement.369 For example, the racial contradictions and ramifications of the Indian Child Welfare Act demonstrate how racism is generally held to be unconstitutional on the one hand, but allowed when it is necessary for the preservation of a culture.370 In other words, contradictory policies lead to black-letter laws that also appear to contradict each other, but must be upheld nonetheless for justice to prevail, despite the feeling of one class of people seeming to be given a privilege that another class does not get. Those who have attempted an adaptation of postmodern thinking to law tend to emphasize the exploration of philosophy as a language game,371 which is convenient as applied to law since language remains a crucial part of all legal thinking and practice.

In essence, three general categories have been helpful in narrowing down the discussion of this game as applied to postmodern law, so that it might lead to a consensus even though contradictions are still ubiquitous: 1) narrative, 2) legitimation, and 3) differend. This chapter will further develop these three words before attempting to assess whether postmodernism is an era that, however well it has served to further more intellectual thinking in law, is now coming to an end. If the end of postmodernism is indeed near, perhaps a glimpse into the future as to what will replace or attenuate it will be possible. The most confusing aspect about postmodernism then remains how ble through the philosophies of the 20th-century continuously looking for new ideas to add to the ongoing dialogue, but also an era no one really has any idea how to end, because no one really knows for certain what it is. The basic idea of tolerance for different opinions without a metanarrative that all opinions should yield to has endless variations as to what social theory, art, or even law should look like, but eventually there must be an end to this freedom and a return to the discernment that not everyone can be right. In fact, it is probably through the law that the postmodern bubble will most likely pop first (if it hasn’t already), based almost entirely on a renewed sense that injustice should not occur. And why should efforts to avoid injustice not be a universal pursuit? As a concept purely in the abstract, narrative provides a general idea that allows a distinct continuity in the representations of ideas formulated by experiences in reality that have been accumulated as knowledge. Just as walking a straight line requires a human being to put one foot in front of the other within an interval of time, a narrative similarly allows events to bind themselves together in time, and through a mysterious process of concatenation, appear as a single idea or unity. Narratives then become playing pieces in a language game that can be moved around the board to formulate either a philosophy favoring modernism or one favoring postmodernism. At the end of the 1970s, when Lyotard contributed his own take on postmodernism in a book called La Condition postmoderne, 372 which appeared in 1984 in English as The Postmodern Condition, 373 his interpretation had the effect of all but exclusively annexing the entire topic and dialogue of postmodernism up to that point, especially in terms of how postmodernism applied to law.374 He proposed Marxism as one of", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634244510_cleaned.txt:61:148ee772bdf6", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 2321, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634244510_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634244510", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634244510_cleaned", "chunk_index": 62, "text": "to formulate either a philosophy favoring modernism or one favoring postmodernism. At the end of the 1970s, when Lyotard contributed his own take on postmodernism in a book called La Condition postmoderne, 372 which appeared in 1984 in English as The Postmodern Condition, 373 his interpretation had the effect of all but exclusively annexing the entire topic and dialogue of postmodernism up to that point, especially in terms of how postmodernism applied to law.374 He proposed Marxism as one of two basic examples of representational models for society in the mid-20th-century, the one most demonstrating how society naturally divides into two parts: class struggle and dialectics.375 (Talcott Parsons was cited as the other example, in which society functions as a whole without division.376) In light of Lyotard’s now quintessential work, Marxism stood as an ongoing example of a “great master narrative” legitimizing political militants for a new social order, but mostly because Marxism espouses that there is some radically different alternative to capitalism in the future.377 Because overcoming the depredations of real existing capitalism, even in its most rudimentary or popularized form, at least appeared to be an all-encompassing and inescapable universal norm, Lyotard proposed and implemented the term “metanarrative” as an important part of the methodology required to legitimize knowledge itself through a philosophy of history.378 Marxism was also a metanarrative, because it proposed how history should enfold in the future to reinforce the ongoing progress of civilization, but it was a grand narrative, in that it was a total science that like Newtonian physics aimed at describing a specific category of reality in a universal way. At first, grand narratives became Lyotard’s postmodernist’s bogeyman because it did not allow the tolerance for trial-and-error detours along the way once the laws were in place.379 Instead, the primacy of the narrative itself, or story-telling in the microcosm, became the focus of Lyotard’s philosophy.380 Above all, it was the vast diversity of narratives and how even contradicting narratives could exist together as useful sources of describing one event. This trend in thinking probably prevailed in Lyotard’s writings because of the curious enticement of a contradictory nature of the youngest notion of early postmodernism: by trying to overcome predominant ideas that were once considered modern, postmodernism functions as if it were its own modern and predominant idea. The temporal aspect of the word “modernism” as something happening “now” makes for confusion and contradiction once postmodernists imply that what they are doing is what is happening “now.” For Lyotard, the old notion that Marx represented a projected future that legitimated its knowledge for everyone, because they were all struggling to attain such a future, is what prevailed under modernism.

Somehow, postmodernism allowed for much more: trial and error once a law was in place, but with seemingly nothing but errors made and nonetheless retained and reused along the way when making projections about what a future would or even should be. Of course, Lyotard was not the first to apply postmodernism to the law, but somehow the word meant many different things to so many thinkers such as Ihab Hassan (defining postmodernism as a sort of “typology of void” in literature381), Michel Foucault (rounding out his historical eras, with modernism beginning in the Renaissance and concepts of “archeology” and Nietzschean “genealogy” used in nonconventional ways to describe new approaches to analysis382), Gilles Deleuze and Félix Guattari (forming together a system that appears to glorify but control concepts analyzing schizophrenia, desire, and an elusive unit of chaos dubbed the “rhizome”383), Jean Baudrillard (sharing Fukuyama’s vision of a vanishing history384), and Fredric Jameson (attempting to distinguish extreme postmodernism from “reconstructive” postmodernism385). Even Lyotard eventually yielded to the approach by Ernesto Laclau and Chantal Mouffe that postmodernism had not replaced modernism, but included it and all other older ways of thinking under the postmodern umbrella.386 Unlike Humpty Dumpty, when the theories of these postmodernists seem to break into a million pieces, as well as any alliances they might have among each other, those pieces always tend to mend themselves back together again to form the ongoing, ever-changing postmodern narrative. Nothing about this formative process soundly brought about a consistency or consensus as to what postmodernism is, but even any disagreement about it among those who intelligently espoused it was embraced as a sort of byproduct of the elusive word. Each version was in essence its own narrative, and according to postmodernism, each narrative had to be honored. The impact of such a remarkable free-for-all was in itself its own type of syncretic narrative, even if consensus, which became an important topic among these postmodernists, was nowhere to be found. Somehow it all reflected the indecipherable nature of the world itself at the brink of some sort of metamorphosis helped along by the unpredictable momentum of an ongoing advancement in technological applications in computers, while struggling against a sort of anti-momentum regarding the mysteries of an ongoing impasse in basic scientific research into subatomic particles versus new scientific impasses regarding mapping of the stars and dark matter.

Under modernism, Freud had a central place as a prophet of liberated desire, while Nietzsche came off as a jack-of-all-trades in the project of decentralizing ideas, as his aphorisms tend to still stand as an example of how consciousness had been fragmented into disparate parts. Even more importantly, Marx suddenly appeared to be the symbol of everything old, while economics and capitalism were redefined as vanguards of some revived new reality. Fascism still lurked here and there, even behind images of commercialism, but the burning concern of not repeating what the Nazis had done during World War II became almost an old-fashioned guilt that could be overcome with a few minor tweaks of one’s conscience without venturing into the hell of immorality. Although the neo-modern equations of the Chicago School of Economics profoundly challenged the more circuitous chains of logic that postmodernism appeared to espouse, the postmodernists still played a stubborn hand of tolerance, not sparring with the new Libertarians and their army of Ayn Rand388 survivalists. Whether opposing it or embracing it, postmodernism allowed an observer to say just about anything about it that might form some sort of almost musical or poetic coherence, because pinning down consensus as to what it all means was all but irrelevant. Lyotard’s bringing in Kant as a foundation further added to the notion that the same Western philosophy, especially German idealism, that had been taken so seriously for so many years despite an ongoing difficulty of understanding what it actually meant was suddenly becoming something full of free associations of meaning. The gaudiness surrounding postmodern pastiche even began flavoring this once solemn tradition of Western philosophy including all of its dour faces on marble busts with the colors and textures of comic book characters. On the other hand, denying the academic politics of it all fell into yet another exercise in liberating the mind to postmodernism, but more likely, ignored how the juxtaposition of these thinkers was taking the form of a secret handshake.

Postmodernists, like any other academic discipline of the last half of the 20th-century, required anyone who wanted to be a part of the movement to name off the important thinkers (such as “Lyotard,” “Deleuze,” “Baudrillard,” et al.) as a prelude to any worthwhile discourse that might add or subtract from what was fast becoming a sacred canon of postmodernism. The question remains whether this academic part of postmodernism was just another defect, or if it actually had become a part of the postmodern narrative itself. Like any other secret handshake, a newbie would never receive back the glint in the eye of the established postmodern beholder, but oddly enough, the newbie should always be a part of the postmodern narrative even if he never has any intention of learning the secret handshake. In this way, the more famous among the postmodernism movement morphed it into a free form of esoteric heuristic that kept only its participants among the powerful few, while continuously espousing that any newbie’s narrative was just as important. That made postmodernism a sort of model of a politic so transparent it was practically invisible and an average onlooker could barely see into it, only if to ultimately learn, upon further deliberation, that he was actually inside of it looking out. Striking what appeared to be a final death knell of Marxism with the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989 and the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1990, with some of the more established postmodernists scrambling for dry ground, newer voices such as Fukuyama’s389 ominously found new ground for postmodernism at least slightly redefined. Such overwhelming and powerful narratives as Fukuyama’s when helped along by the American press further added to what was becoming the collective comic book imagery of mass media narratives delivered by colorful talking head commentators. On the other hand, that has not silenced other postmodernists like Gianni Vattimo from formulating new narratives, especially in terms of newly elected Marxist leaders in Latin America as the 21st-century dawned.390 One narrative that included Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez calling the President of the United States George W. Bush a “devil,” suggested possible retaliations, even veiled threats of U.S.-instigated assassination attempts.391 The same American President asserted an alliance with a reluctant President and General Pervez Musharraf of Pakistan, even though the latter had once blamed the American CIA for the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001, and supported the very enemy the alliance’s purpose was to destroy: the Taliban (the same former President Musharraf faced the death penalty after a trial for treason which", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634244510_cleaned.txt:65:2f6453dbaf90", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 2325, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634244510_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634244510", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634244510_cleaned", "chunk_index": 66, "text": "United States George W.

If postmodernism is indeed tolerant of such contradictory sentiments in the process of embracing all narratives, even if contradictory, as viable microcosms that when considered altogether produce the closest thing to a universal whole, hasn’t it been simply a reinvention of nihilism, at least at the microcosmic level, or “Anything Goes”? At some point, the macrocosms step in to curb its tolerance and declare certain things untruths, but then we are back to square one and talking in terms of universalism, metanarratives, and grand narratives. Still, the language game poses these much more difficult questions in terms of narrative, while something else that uses narrative, like music, makes its claims to narrative without ever having to contradict itself.393 Instead of contradictions, one version of postmodern music dealt with clashing preexisting musical styles against each other into a collage—one style did not “belong” with the other. If this trend in music is any indication, it would suggest that any truths or even aesthetic judgment to be ascertained through the lens of the postmodern thinker has to do with treating the separate narratives as secondary in meaning, if not already dead in terms of their original meanings, in and of themselves, but which live when combined with other narratives into a newly formed whole. These types of questions concerning the very nature of narrative require yet more borrowing from disciplines such as sociology, anthropology, religion, history and even the law and literature movement. Sociologist Hayden White (1928-2018) narrowed the nature of narrative down to “knowing” somehow converted into a “telling,”394 specifying that unlike other types of writing, narrative is easy to translate from one language to the next.395 In this way, narrative is a simple form of discourse and tends to limited itself to only the third person singular and a couple of tenses, such as the preterit or pluperfect.396 The further purity of events that “really happened” (i.e., not imaginary or myth) which are told by a distinct “teller” who is most often never referred to in the narrative itself, forms one of the crucial building blocks of at least historiography in", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634244510_cleaned.txt:66:e70a1b499022", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 2326, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634244510_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634244510", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634244510_cleaned", "chunk_index": 67, "text": "one language to the next.395 In this way, narrative is a simple form of discourse and tends to limited itself to only the third person singular and a couple of tenses, such as the preterit or pluperfect.396 The further purity of events that “really happened” (i.e., not imaginary or myth) which are told by a distinct “teller” who is most often never referred to in the narrative itself, forms one of the crucial building blocks of at least historiography in its most basic form, if not other forms of common discourse. That is, of course, not to say that history must always be told in a narrative form; historians are free to use other types of discourse. Still, historians thrive for an accuracy, and vouch for it, which implies that certain narratives can be inaccurate or false. Historians can make things up out of mischief, or can make genuine mistakes. They can also simply not know about certain stretches of the past and make things up out of utility. If postmodernists are so sensitive about history, how can there possibly be a trend of tolerance for differing narratives? “It is not true that one can do an aesthetic politics. It is not true the search for intensities or things of that type can ground politics, because there is the problem of injustice. It is not true, for example, that once one has gotten rid of the primacy of the understanding in its knowing function, there is only aesthetic judgment left to discriminate between the just and the unjust. Aesthetic judgment allows the discrimination of that which pleases from that which does not please. With justice, we have to do, of necessity, with the regulation of something else.”397 On the other hand, just as Lyotard had zeroed in on the problem of postmodernism, the problem resurrects itself in precisely the very conflicts that originally gave birth to postmodernism. Lyotard’s complex philosophical treatise of Neo-Kantian and Hellenistic thought called the Differend398 invites the reader to mull over the genuine problem that one act in the name of justice can create several injustices. Two parties in dispute might reach a solution that does not wipe away injustice, but mitigates it for one party to a more tolerable level, while putting the other party at an even lower but impliedly tolerable level of injustice. Our justice system depends upon the mass media narrative that the justice system, like an auto mechanic, takes in matters of dispute and fixes them into well-running, high performance vehicles. When the jury speaks, justice is done, and the situation is “fixed.” Lyotard’s journey through the problems of the differend and injustice hit the postmodern nail so firmly on the head, that it will require further analysis in the third part of this chapter.

Just the same, if multifarious and even contradictory narratives function as building blocks in the microcosmic level of a reality that will never march in one direction, has the law really recognized this and if so, how will the Wizard-of-Oz illusion that modern society maintains justice through its legal system (the main concept behind “legitimation”) stand the shock that justice is an elusive and unattainable metanarrative? Postmodernism demonstrates this problem, so if there is no solution in sight, is postmodernism the final resting point of all philosophical inquiry? Calling this dilemma an aporia, as postmodernists do, ties it down in a seemingly temporary way, but also feigns a control over something that is still intellectually, scientifically, and even socially without control or understanding. In fact, there is really no difference in this confrontation with aporia than Wittgenstein’s famous final sentence in his Logische-Philosphische Abhandlung. 399 One insightful maverick who gave the concept “narrative” a central position in his by and large postmodern thinking of law and philosophy was Robert Cover (1943-1986), although he never otherwise embraced the rubric postmodernism or endorsed its adherents by name. In his essay “Nomos and Narrative,”400 Cover cryptically but with clear deliberateness demonstrates how precepts of law which are in essence all but written in stone can invent its own exceptions through the power of sacred narratives, such as those in the Bible. Stories of the respected forbears of people in a community bound by a sense of history, if not race, that are preserved through the power of myth and tradition depict these honored forbears as using guile and “human deceit”401 to break the law. Referring to the law with the Greek word “nomos,” Cover explains that it is the combination of the concrete precepts versus the law-breaking stories that combine to form a “typology of reversal.”402 This is similar to how the postmodernists use narratives to overcome a sense of foundationalism and an ultimate totality. In this way, what has prevailed under the allusive rubric of postmodernism in law resembles a state of affairs that has long existed as an alternative to the brutality of the sovereign conqueror. The tendency to view any one king as being the same as any other overlooks those exceptions in history where a conqueror did not engage in utter genocide or the destruction of a conquered people’s language, religion, and culture.

Prodigious examples of this in history include when the Persians allowed the Jews to go back to their temple in Jerusalem and practice their religion after centuries of slavery under the Babylonians and Medes,403 but also the concept of Federalism in the United States Constitution.404 On the other hand, if the U.S. Constitution is a product of the Enlightenment and therefore under the postmodern regime a product of modernity, how would a postmodern constitution differ? Under such an analogy, the 50 States of America serve as 50 narratives whose diversity in laws and traditions are allowed to flourish on their own. So if history has already produced examples of conflicting and contradicting narratives that can coexist in an ultimate entity that does not force them to conform to the point of utter assimilation, except when absolutely necessary, did postmodernism invent anything new, or was it simply some sort of reinvention in light of new technology and/or new oppressive politics in light of the post-Vietnam era? If Lyotard’s vision involved tolerating the conflicting and contradicting narratives at the microcosm, did he fail to see that postmodernism itself serves as the grand narrative, even though it remains unfocused and undefined? This still remains a crucial and key argument toward moving beyond this overall trend of postmodernism. If there is one thing that postmodernism in law preserves over the tolerance of the Enlightenment, it is that language games and all its contradictions as part of the overall structuring of a theory of law prevails, as it does in a postmodern society as a whole. The U.S. Constitution of the Enlightenment makes for a bold statement in history as to tolerating the different narratives of its now 50 States, but introducing mechanisms that allow for even more conflicting and contradicting laws and policies is probably the best way to describe what the postmodern revolution has tried to accomplish. Precisely what such mechanisms would be has yet to be determined.

This process of legitimation emphasizing democracy now stands as a foil against postmodernism, especially from the works of Habermas, despite the fact that Lyotard’s ideas are ultimately developed through Neo-Kantianism as well. Such problems of legitimation of a state are also what drove postmodernists into criticizing the ideal of the consensus as not always maintaining or even achieving legitimacy, in that a more powerful position can often sway others into a consensus they don’t really want. Still, Habermas has distinguished himself from postmodernism by thoroughly critiquing the problems of legitimation, as well as discourse, into two guiding principles: facticity (Faktizität) and validation (Geltung).406 Throughout Habermas’s critique of such problems of legitimation, the importance of discourse, or discourse theory, includes narrative, but also other forms of discourse, such as the philosophical and the economic. Specifically, his idea of communicative action (Handeln) stands as the most fundamental position in his philosophy.407 In fact, communicative action is so fundamental in a philosophy of legitimation and law, he emphasizes it is also ahistorical. In other words, Marxism emphasized a certain imminence as to how history forces us to form philosophical solutions, while Habermas insists that such imminence is no longer relevant, because of a breakdown and cynicism of the bourgeoisie that is so critical to legitimating democracy.408 The essence of the rift between Habermas’s philosophy of communicative action and the postmodernists has to do with whether Habermas’s position is simply some sort of a modification of modernism and the Enlightenment, and therefore not anything postmodernist at all. Habermas also has proved in the past (against Gadamer, for example) that he has a quick trigger finger when it comes to associating certain philosophies with fascism, such as Nietzsche and Heidegger.409 The tendency with Habermas is to associate postmodernism first with a type of conservatism, because it somehow is supposed to go against modernity, but second with irrationality and anarchy. Although there are certainly things about fascism that make it a mystical or irrational point of view, as well as an anti-democratic point of view, it makes for an overgeneralized confusion when attempting to sort out exactly the position politically that postmodernists have been taking. Although Libertarianism in America could be safely considered a conservative philosophy (despite some who disingenuously insist it is an optimal blending of both liberal and conservative), based on an anti-democratic stance adverse to government in general, their ranks rarely espouse anything that appears to be postmodern or the doctrines of postmodernists, let alone “irrationalists.” In fact, the selling point of Libertarianism is that there is a rational way", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634244510_cleaned.txt:70:f9c1ad4be9e1", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 2330, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634244510_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634244510", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634244510_cleaned", "chunk_index": 71, "text": "to sort out exactly the position politically that postmodernists have been taking.

Still, Lyotard is the one espousing a higher aesthetic of the sublime, while Habermas’s is more the aesthetic of the beautiful.411 Simply one subtle shade of the definition of the word “sublime” versus “beautiful” allows the imagination to run away with the former as a more intense, all-encompassing emotion that can drive people to irrational behavior, while the latter is a more generic and passive representation for something that is simply pleasing or bucolic. There really has been no direct debate between Lyotard and Habermas,412 although there have been associates who have taken positions in the spirit of their mentors to the extent that camps have been created and battle lines drawn.413 Lyotard does mention Habermas in the Postmodern Condition, and appears to quibble over Habermas’s quickness to call certain French philosophers Neo-Conservatives.414 On the other hand, if justice is a concept reflecting more the leftwing of politics, both Lyotard and Habermas share this ideal, even if Habermas’s is more from an Enlightenment point of view, with Lyotard stating that justice tends to prevail in the end, but as something inevitable and not solely within the will of human beings.415 Certainly, both Lyotard and Habermas respect the role of intersubjectivity, or how two different personal narratives interact, finding common ground and influencing each other. What Habermas emphasizes is that through his basic building block of language, communicative action, is the ideal of finding consensus, while for Lyotard, dissensus can be as important as consensus. As a byproduct of this slightly differing norm, Lyotard welcomes a proliferation of new kinds of discourse through intersubjectivity, while Habermas", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634244510_cleaned.txt:71:bf095cd8f88d", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 2331, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634244510_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634244510", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634244510_cleaned", "chunk_index": 72, "text": "the will of human beings.415 Certainly, both Lyotard and Habermas respect the role of intersubjectivity, or how two different personal narratives interact, finding common ground and influencing each other.

As a byproduct of this slightly differing norm, Lyotard welcomes a proliferation of new kinds of discourse through intersubjectivity, while Habermas tries to keep the categories of discourse well-defined and examples of discourse pure, especially scientific reason. Lyotard’s view has emphasized another aspect of postmodernism, known as agonism or agonistics. This has been championed by Mouffe,416 but basically accepts that democracy is best an act in which all opinions, most importantly the dissenters, continue to dissent, if necessary, and not willingly accept the consensus of the majority as if any matter is once and for all resolved. For a point of contention within a democracy, this is actually an extremely fine line, in light of any rift that Habermas might have with the agonistic point of view. Still, it is now a fundamental difference between a modernist who stoically accepts the majority’s opinion, if it doesn’t trample upon a minority’s rights, and a postmodernist who essentially threatens the process with stagnation, if a minority point of view is of such value, it deserves to be preserved. Such differences also probably reflect a certain prosperity to rest upon, while in the early days of America, the threat of survival played upon an expediency for democracy to make decisive opinions, and not to lay dormant in a deadlock of combating views. In essence, the word “legitimation” stands for the stoic expediency approach to democracy, versus the ultimate freedom of all voices to be heard and preserved. A law is legitimated through a solemn process, and its citizens adhere to the decisions made out of respect for the process, even though they disagree with the laws. Engaging in civil disobedience once a law is enacted goes against the process of legitimation but brings with it a richer plurality of voices, which is what postmodernists intend to do. Still, in this analysis, it is difficult to escape a simple dialectic between a democracy that solemnly expects its citizens to comply with what has been democratically decided and a democracy in which the citizens are more irreverent to the process and will to continue espousing their views, even when defeated—tomorrow is another day. When adding to this the concept of metanarrative, the Enlightenment still stands for the creation of a grand narrative that will be the ideal that all strive for, while postmodernism allows for trial and error along the way to strengthen the ultimate plan by allowing for contingencies.

Minorities transform into a majority, and vice versa. It is difficult to fathom that this simple dialectic represents a chasm, although in light of how modernism can be portrayed as an unstoppable force marching forward, even if losing its legitimacy, the cry for postmodernism to free things up is entirely reasonable. As far as the irrational is concerned, it is difficult to allow even Habermas’s criticism of postmodernism to be portrayed as postmodernists wanting to be irrational and challenging the very rationalism of the Enlightenment (let alone that this is somehow a conservative point of view and pejorative). More likely, the irrational is simply a concept that allows the rational to dip into the pool of irrationality now and then, only in search of an idea that is better suited for present circumstances. Aporia has always existed in extremes, whether humans act with utter irrationality (based on all of Habermas’s observations of a society losing legitimacy in the process417), or whether they act with too much stoicism to the will of the majority, even when the majority has achieved its status through an artful or superior power that does not ultimately serve a democratic ideal. By creating his own metanarrative into one book,418 Habermas successfully sums up his philosophy of communicative action and how it has endured throughout the postmodern era, giving the project a great weight as yet another volume in the grand narrative of German philosophy. The question remains as to whether Habermas really has navigated through the postmodern era without picking up some of its ideas along the way. Habermas succinctly puts forth Aristotle’s practical reason (praktische Vernunft) as shifting from the society in ancient times to the individual during the Enlightenment. In the era of communicative action, Habermas concludes that the model has become so complex, both society and individual must be considered. By distinguishing between practical reason in the Enlightenment and what it entails now, even suggesting that the model is too complex to be pat and simple, has not Habermas constructed a model at least very similar to what postmodernists espouse? Because the second noun in the title of Habermas’s magnum opus is “validity” (Geltung), a refined concept following his earlier use of the word “legitimation,”419 Habermas’s version of postmodernism would not be the same sort of free-for-all of generally allowing all narratives to co-exist, whether part of a consensus or a separate dissensus, but only requires the extra step of validating the facts of the narrative into an enforceable", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634244510_cleaned.txt:73:14350178ad65", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 2333, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634244510_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634244510", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634244510_cleaned", "chunk_index": 74, "text": "constructed a model at least very similar to what postmodernists espouse?

The fact that the narrative might be part of the consensus does not automatically legitimize it, nor does the fact that it is part of the dissensus delegitimize it. Even what has been translated into English as Habermas’s word for “law,” or the German word “Recht,” carries with it a fairness element, unlike more common German words for “law,” e.g., “Gesetz.” To translate this German word into English with the more obvious word “right” has with it some different connotations, such as of our rights as understood in American law, although as a fundamental aspect of the German civil-law system, or “subjektives Recht,”420 this word describes the fundamental aspect of legitimation that rests in the more general idea of rights as something intersubjective rather than purely atomistic to the individual.421 Even if lost somewhat in translation, not to mention American versus German notions of democracy and rights, the democratic process combining legitimation via rights, which have a moral element to them, and legitimation via legislation or contract, also has to it both a moral and contractual element of legitimation via consensus. Habermas is careful to allow all the nuances of several different approaches to democracy, but in these nuances blur the primacy of legitimation via consensus, if not to the same extent, at least in the same direction as the postmodernists do. The moral principal inherent in individual rights was sacred ground under the Enlightenment, or what the postmodernists might generally refer to as modernism. Compromising this sacredness with the idea that the intersubjective aspect of rights makes the idealism of the Enlightenment no longer realistic, implies that Habermas endorses a similar point of view to the postmodernists, even if he resists the comparison. Above all, Habermas reduced the dichotomy down to human rights (Menschenrechte422) and popular sovereignty (Volkssouveränität423), but emphasized their complementary constructions. This has been further simplified to morality (Moral424) and law/fairness (Recht425). Behind both were Habermas’s neutral idea of “action norms” (Handlungsnormen), summed up in the following discourse principal: This central “discourse theory” (Diskurstheorie) of course implies that the “rational” quality of the discourse will accept both concepts. Consequently, postmodernists might be accused of many things, including following only the irrational in terms of either rejecting both concepts of morality and law, or taking sides only with the human rights side of the equation or morality.

Rebelliousness is classically such an anti-state posture that rejects its laws from a viewpoint of freedom from some sort of oppression. In modern American politics, rebelliousness has even become the new form of conservatism, in terms of not paying taxes and revolting against a liberal government.427 Meanwhile, classically conservative notions include a loyalty to the state, more in line with a sovereign, whether popularly derived or based on something more traditional as a bloodline or conqueror. Still, this traditional conservative has its own morality, based on these notions of loyalty, but is more a procedural type of loyalty based on positivism. Habermas has not reinvented the wheel here, but clearly has provided nuances to go beyond traditional points of view. Two more nuances that he recognizes from 19th-century that go towards the modern political divide are “self-determination”428 (conservative) and “self-realization”429 (liberal). To this end, he states the following: “However, these ideas of self-determination and self-realization cannot be put together without tension. Not surprisingly, social-contract theories [i.e., the former] (Vernunftrecht) have responded to the modern ideals of justice (Gerechtigkeitsideen) and the good life [i.e., the latter] (Lebensideale) with answers that bear different accents.”430 It may always be a radical stance to argue politics from the point of view that the other side of the political spectrum is always wrong. At least Habermas’s discourse theory is postmodern enough to accept and even thrive off of how complementary the two sides are, even if they are not the same thing. n comparing Habermas with Lyotard, deeper analysis allows central con-Icepts of the two—communicative action versus differend—to clash, but also to demonstrate more similarities than either would have probably liked to have admitted back in the 1990s, when Lyotard was still alive.431 Certainly, Lyotard freely employed his own version of Wittgenstein’s language games that Habermas undoubtedly has also continued to employ, if not in a differing version involving a “rule of recognition” (Erkenntnisregel).432 Meanwhile, what has traditionally become the attack by critical theory of the Frankfurt School, which Habermas is often associated with, on postmodernism involves defending broad topics that postmodernism is supposed to reject, such as reason, universality, and normativity, not to mention the Enlightenment and modernity as a whole.433 If comparing both Habermas and Lyotard can soften the sometimes exaggerated stances of the two, especially in that they share the importance of language games—Habermas as a means to find consensus through a specific and deliberate discourse theory which borrows heavily from Kant,", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634244510_cleaned.txt:75:67867bd2c89a", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 2335, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634244510_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634244510", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634244510_cleaned", "chunk_index": 76, "text": "the Frankfurt School, which Habermas is often associated with, on postmodernism involves defending broad topics that postmodernism is supposed to reject, such as reason, universality, and normativity, not to mention the Enlightenment and modernity as a whole.433 If comparing both Habermas and Lyotard can soften the sometimes exaggerated stances of the two, especially in that they share the importance of language games—Habermas as a means to find consensus through a specific and deliberate discourse theory which borrows heavily from Kant, while Lyotard is more in line with showing how the various forms of discourse as categorized by Kant (theoretical, practical, and aesthetic434) remain apart—finding common ground might help move beyond any perceived impasse into a new direction of thinking (hopefully a direction of thinking that can be called something other than “postpostmodernism”). What Lyotard and the postmodernists were most concerned with dealt with how minorities in a democracy can be led by the more clever factions in society to vote against their interests. Certainly Habermas’s communicative action theory and struggle for consensus has hardly been characterized as condoning a sinister element to take over society with guile and misusing the process of legitimation via popular sovereignty and a resulting positivism to prevent the genuinely oppressed to free themselves from tyranny, even though real existing Communism, not to mention Fascism, have both often been accused of misusing democracy in this very way. Such easy examples aside, what the postmodernists are mostly worried about are that minorities in democracies like the United States and modern Germany and France suffer under oppressive systems brought about by sinister elements that abuse democracy that voting people often are completely unaware of. Habermas would be more inclined to admire the process of reaching consensus in modern democracies, emphasizing the moral element in his discourse theory, which leaves open the possibility that immoral behavior can indeed cause oppression in a democracy: “Discourse theory conceives of morality as an authority that crosses the boundaries between private and public spheres (Lebensbereichen); these boundaries vary throughout history anyhow, depending on social structure (Sozialstruktur).”435 Although such a morality might lead to a universal concept that postmodernists are popularly accused of eschewing, Habermas grounds this morality in Kant, which Lyotard has also endorsed, as the following reflection by Lyotard on Kant’s notion of “presentation” (Darstellung) reveals: “Despite the name it bears, the Kantian Darstellung is not at all the presentation of a phrase universe…More generally, presentation supposes a capacity for finding the example or the case which fits a rule, and for finding it without a rule…This capacity to judge in a nondeterminant fashion is exerted outside the realm of cognition: in morality, where just action needs to be determined with no instruction other than the moral law, which ought to leave that action undetermined….”436 To summarize it as simply as possible, Lyotard’s concept of the differend is a situation, such as", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634244510_cleaned.txt:76:9e7d575c613e", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 2336, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634244510_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634244510", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634244510_cleaned", "chunk_index": 77, "text": "phrase universe…More generally, presentation supposes a capacity for finding the example or the case which fits a rule, and for finding it without a rule…This capacity to judge in a nondeterminant fashion is exerted outside the realm of cognition: in morality, where just action needs to be determined with no instruction other than the moral law, which ought to leave that action undetermined….”436 To summarize it as simply as possible, Lyotard’s concept of the differend is a situation, such as in a litigation, where both narratives cannot resolve without unjustly harming the other so that any solution favoring one side or the other will be generally unjust.437 One can quibble as to how often such genuine situations come up in litigations or whether this is apropos of the language games that Wittgenstein was actually referring to, but at heart is the universal concept of injustice, which suggests that at least in the case of Lyotard, his postmodern stance against universal concepts as possible modes of oppression, is overstated by his critics. Whether softening the impact of the legitimation of a consensus so that all minority narratives should dutifully follow the majority as a moral act of democracy, or outright accusing a minority with an interest against the now legitimized narrative of the majority of guile and bad faith, both Lyotard and Habermas share a common ground in morality as based in Kant.438 In his stance towards Nietzsche, Lyotard has always been aware that among postmodernists an appeal to passion that defies all democratization and that should preserve minorities in a system of agonistics should not overstep itself. He himself quibbles about this, as the following passage from The Differend exemplifies: “Is postmodernity the pastime of an old man who scrounges in the garbage-heap of finality looking for leftovers, who brandishes unconsciousnesses, lapses, limits, confines, goulags, parataxes, non-senses, or paradoxes, and who turns this into the glory of his novelty, into his promise of change? But this too is a goal for a certain humanity. A genre. (A bad parody of Nietzsche. Why?)”439 If Habermas is merely sensitive to all forms of thinking that may have at one time been instrumental in the formation of Nazi Germany and any similarities to an immoral authoritarian social theory, this alone should not prevent a final rapprochement of Habermas’s communicative action and discourse theory with Lyotard’s postmodernism. Marx may be a more difficult issue to resolve than Nietzsche, especially based on what remains in the West of the ruins of the Cold War, but as long as there is a moral and immoral way of conducting a democracy, implementing mechanisms to prevent the immoral would find both Habermas and Lyotard useful.

As stated in the introduction, one of the best examples of Lyotard’s differend are the issues surrounding the Indian Child Welfare Act (ICWA), which in 1978 sought to prevent Indian children from being routinely removed from their cultures without necessity. Atwood deftly embraces postmodern ideals in a moderate, less caustic way to help explain the intricacies of such seemingly contradictory legal issues. Lyotard’s philosophy is in this way put to practical use, as the following excerpt indicates: “To Lyotard, the disappearance of metanarratives has left us with the liberating potential of local, interlocking language games—a weave of intricate interconnections that has no over-arching, defining commonality. In his work, this philosopher uses the term ‘differends’ to mean the ways in which persons from different cultures may talk past one another because of the particular narratives and language games that are distinct to each culture.”442 In the case of the ICWA, the policies against racism that were so instrumental in alleviating the racial unrest that typified the African American communities of America, clashed remarkably with the policies against the brutal assimilation policies that typified the ongoing struggle to preserve American Indian cultures. Ruffin’s further development of the complexities of the policies behind the ICWA mentions the high suicide rate among American Indian youths as being twice the national average, and citing a sociological theory for this being that they are raised outside of their own cultural systems.443 Unfortunately such complexities of policy or Lyotard’s differend itself have eluded one of the more recent Supreme Court decisions involving the ICWA, Adoptive Couple v. Baby Girl. 444 Despite the anonymity of the case’s official title, this opinion provided appellants Matt and Melanie Capobianco a victory and media event which allowed them to take back custody of their once adopted daughter, Veronica, from the birth father, Dusten Brown, after the child had been in his custody for more than two years.445 Brown’s Hispanic girlfriend, Chrissy Maldonado, put the baby up for adoption, even though Brown’s 3/128 Cherokee blood gave the baby 3/256 Cherokee blood, and the ICWA required that the Cherokee Nation’s Tribal Court have a say in the adoption.446 J. Samuel Alito wrote the opinion for the majority447 and deemed that Brown had abandoned baby Veronica at birth and therefore never had custody of her, until the South Carolina Supreme Court ruled in his favor after she was 27 months old.448 Through an unlikely interpretation of the articulation “continued custody” as helped along by the Compact Oxford, Webster’s, and American Heritage dictionaries,449 Brown could not be eligible for the protections claimed under the ICWA because he never", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634244510_cleaned.txt:78:52a678ebdecb", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 2338, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634244510_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634244510", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634244510_cleaned", "chunk_index": 79, "text": "the adoption.446 J.

Aside from Alito’s hermeneutical anomaly, which not even the ardent textualist J. Antonin Scalia agrees with,450 the issue that especially gets sidestepped in Adoptive Couple is the clashing policies of preserving American Indian cultures on the one hand and the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment on the other. In her dissent, J. Sonia Sotomayor addresses the issue by citing notoriously controversial Federal Indian Law cases on point which bypass equal protection to protect American Indian interests.451 Alito only mentions the Equal Protection problems briefly, but most certainly does not recognize the differend issue as such or in any such way consistent with case law Sotomayor cites.452 Adoptive Couple was a case that involved high emotions from both sides, although it is not clear in the media blitz how the legal theories were playing out as they were upstaged by the emotional heartstrings created from a baby girl born in Oklahoma, raised for the first two years in South Carolina by an adoptive couple, moved back to Oklahoma to be raised by her birth father for the next two years of her life, and then finally moved back to the adoptive couple permanently. Watching the potent policy arguments from both sides ostensibly overlooked the fact that the baby girl was only 3/256 Cherokee, on the one hand, and will probably have more emotional trauma being taken away from her birth father at age four than the previous removal from adoptive parents at age two. Meanwhile, the original policy of ICWA becomes gutted substantially by the ruling, but above all, the differend aspect of Equal Protection policy versus permitted Federal racial classifications for American Indians is completely ignored, with the exception of its being mentioned in the dissent by Sotomayor. Whatever the ultimate political dynamics of Adoptive Couple are, the side that might end up favoring Lyotard’s postmodernism did not prevail. Whether sending out conservative messages to unwed couples and deadbeat dads that the Court favors more stable households for raising children, or even the more pernicious message of preferring a white upbringing for an innocent baby to an American Indian upbringing, if there’s actually a choice to be made, such a timely and sensationalized Supreme Court case demonstrates that there is nothing particularly settled when it comes to reforming the American legal system to", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634244510_cleaned.txt:79:6bf16f2658f9", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 2339, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634244510_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634244510", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634244510_cleaned", "chunk_index": 80, "text": "favoring Lyotard’s postmodernism did not prevail.

Although this is only one example, the implication is that American politics may still consider such Continental European legal philosophies as Lyotard’s with suspicion. Postmodernism may therefore not be abandoned entirely as passé, but, rather, something to be refined and perfected into a new cycle of argumentation. Efforts to “reclaim history” at the beginning of the 21st centu-ry are producing sanitized stories generously borrowing from old American myths that were once widely thought to be moribund and no longer plausible.454 Perhaps this reclamation especially inspired the one fell swoop through a jurisdictional maze in which Aquash, once believed to be a legendary victim of the same right-wing extremism she dedicated her life to fighting, became a victim of left-wing militant radicalism. If the original notion is correct and members of GOONs killed her, it probably happened somewhere other than where her body was dumped, and the FBI initially did nothing. Looking Cloud said he took the gun from Graham after the execution of Aquash and fired the remaining bullets into the ground. No such bullets or bullet holes in the ground were ever found at the location identified by Looking Cloud as the murder site (i.e., near the cliff her body was thrown over). It’s also unlikely that feisty Aquash would have ever allowed a lower level AIM operative such as Theda Clarke to “arrest” her, let alone to tie her to a board and transport her as a prisoner in the back of a Pinto hatchback. The large rear window of a Pinto hatchback would have allowed any motorist between Colorado and South Dakota to see a woman tied up inside. Witnesses who claimed to see Aquash restrained this way at Clarke’s residence could have easily been tricked by innuendo, coaching, or some other theatrics. Aside from a nagging embarrassment that the FBI went through trying to deny that anything was known about Aquash’s murder, legal machinations and outright depredations surrounding the Peltier trial induced even more anti-FBI sentiments. A new mop-up of the Aquash case allowed a convenient way to push back on the growing popular sentiment for Peltier. Peltier claims he did little else than blindly fire his rifle at a distance from the gun battle that ensued between Agents Coler and Williams and three other AIM members: Bob Robideau, Norman Charles, and Joe Stuntz (who also perished).

Robideau, who seems to have originated the cover story that a red pickup truck was involved, admits he fired the shot that would have caused Coler to bleed out. Even though Robideau was acquitted on a self-defense theory and protected by his right against double jeopardy, he never confessed publicly and did not testify at Peltier’s trial to being the one who committed the close range executions of the agents. After these ignoble deaths of Coler and Williams, the frustrated FBI instinctively went after the three most prominent and most wanted AIM members: Robideau, Butler, and Peltier. As much as this might have been perceived as at least overkill, it probably did include the man who most likely committed the executions, Robideau. Just the same, even the close range executions should have been more vigorously analyzed according to theories of adequate provocation, which would have amounted to voluntary manslaughter for Robideau rather than murder. His acts no doubt proceeded while in a panic state following the death of his colleague Stuntz. Even defense attorney William Kunstler appeared a bit shocked that a self-defense theory for Robideau and Butler based on the martial law declared on the reservation could prevail. As a heroin addict, Looking Cloud still has memories of his 1975 trip to South Dakota with Canadians Graham and Aquash, serving as their guide to the reservation he grew up on. Should we really not dare to suspect that Looking Cloud’s close “blood brother,” Richard Two Elk, who wrote the foreword to the FBI’s new myth of the events,455 coached a few extra facts into Looking Cloud’s already foggy memory? In fact, perhaps the revelations from Looking Cloud, whose arrangement with the FBI yielded him a life sentence in prison, might be an artfully induced piece of pure fiction, based on only dribs and drabs of innocuous fact. Different juries did not dare question Looking Cloud’s narrative as presented to them, but legal postmodernists may acknowledge the procedure the jury verdicts created and still wonder about an actual truth or injustice that might warrant clemency from the President. In this way, the implausibility of Looking Cloud’s ultimate narrative and its legitimation also suggest that despite its many safeguards and painstaking care in procedure, the legal system encountered a situation that has morphed into a genuine differend, according to Lyotard’s definition.

In other words, when such argumentation depends on such suspicious narratives that are nonetheless legitimatized, the law itself should acknowledge the conundrum it has encountered and singlehandedly created. Aside from its language games, aporia, and blatant contradictions, postmodernism stands for a softening of modernity through the lens of the Enlightenment. Narrative, legitimation, and differend as defined in the previous chapter and now illustrated with the Aquash and Peltier cases can thus form a three-prong test for seemingly contradictory, postmodern legal situations. If these three concepts promulgated three simple standards (1. don’t oppress minority narratives; 2. allow democratically prevailing narratives their procedural legitimation, but without undue oppression of rights; and 3. recognize and respect a differend when encountered by finding an alternative solution between the two disputing narratives without declaring winner and loser), postmodernism could be policy inserted somewhere into a Supreme Court decision or written up somehow as the preamble of a bill by Congress. On the other hand, postmodernism as an era of Western philosophy is typically expounded not with a voice of friendly persuasion, but as the necessary new modernity. This appears to be inescapable as a rule of advocacy. In other words, it must be followed, the adherents typically say. Its appeal to morality, especially through Kant, is like any such appeal: humanity and civilization require of us to adopt postmodernism to protect minority narratives from oppression and to insure that language games do not accumulate into an inescapable conundrum. Stated in such terms, it remains, like so many other language games, something with no logical conclusion. A boundary of ignorance typically protects partakers of discourse and argumentation from getting too close to the sheer terror that language can inevitably never resolve itself or anything. To mutually agree not to cross unstated but clear boundaries simplifies the reality of both sides to an argument, until the brutality of injustice sets in and forces a losing side to not accept the other side’s victory by any means possible. Legal postmodernism as a critique of the fundamental flaw of democracy (oppression by the majority), often also gives rise to outright antidemocratic points of view with someone like Machiavelli or Nietzsche as a muse. Counterintuitively, it often emerges on the politically left side of things. Clearly, some not only do not want the softening to occur, but would rather see society move to even more rigid standards.

Perhaps this defines the recognition of postmodernism as a politically left concept against the more objective attempt by the political right to rid language of its games once and for all. So how should the right side of things view postmodernism? Tom Sawyer’s great prank of getting out of his punishment for fighting by convincing his friends that whitewashing the fence is such a great pastime that he will only allow them to do it if they give him something of value in exchange, makes for a charming argument in favor of the free use of guile in capitalism.456 Postmodern arguments that such guile should be looked upon as the creation of oppression tell a markedly different narrative as to how democracy should proceed, since ultimately what Tom and his friends have created is a unanimous consensus, despite what a skeptical onlooker might feel about the arrangement. Likewise, the guileful Wizard of Oz has little guilt in spreading the mythic narrative that a powerfully magic force rules over the great city making its inhabitants fear something that does not exist, because after all, he is not a bad man, but simply a “bad wizard.”457 To dismiss postmodernists simply for being too persnickety or having no sense of humor in assessing the ways of the world, or dismissing the agonistics suffered by the minorities of a democracy as nothing more unjust than hard knock lessons, is in line with an ideologically competitive society like the United States. The aggressive tenets of capitalism have certainly marched on throughout the postmodern era since 1975, even though collapses in the free market system roughly every decade (S&L crisis that finally ceased in 1995; Enron Scandal of 2001; and the subprime mortgage collapse of 2008) all accompanied by major Government bailouts, ought to have cast some light on the idea of safeguarding a purely free market with some oversights and safety measures. Even in a hypothetical situation where the majority has ultimately been tricked into something against their interests, as well as the interests of the minorities, finding anything wrong with the deception may prove a hard sell in such a historical context. Moreover, the injustice finally felt by those tricked into forming an illusory majority (i.e., when they finally form a different face to the deception in their own mind that has fooled them) makes for just as much instability in a democracy which uses legitimation as a mere loophole to some more sinister, selfish end than any other base", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634244510_cleaned.txt:83:af92341a9851", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 2343, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634244510_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634244510", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634244510_cleaned", "chunk_index": 84, "text": "as the interests of the minorities, finding anything wrong with the deception may prove a hard sell in such a historical context.

Harry Truman famously made political hay of this sentiment during his 1948 Presidential reelection campaign with the saying, “How many times do you have to be hit over the head before you figure out who’s hitting you,”458 but such once common overt suspicion of being fooled in a democracy often gives way to the comfort of safety, as long as the voter in a democracy believes they are included among the ranks of the good people being protected. For all these good reasons, at least Lyotard’s differend should never be something that a healthy democracy ignores, because the phenomenon is so easy to demonstrate, with the Aquash and Peltier cases serving as only two out of many prime examples of how contradicting policies make a mess of things. There is a strong tendency in a democracy and its legal disputes in courts to treat disputes as cosmic forces and that nature will select its champions, much like the Roman tradition of litiscontestatio, or trial by ordeal459 or the laissez faire capitalist who believes that natural selection fairly chooses what ought to be preserved and what is not worth preserving. This concept has won remarkable popular sway during the last quarter of the 20th-century, despite its profound metaphysical implications within what can be a brutally rigid doctrine of the Chicago School of Economics or Libertarianism.460 If you belong to one of the narratives that nature has chosen for extinction, the brutality can especially be experienced, as well as the notion that a modern dogma has prevailed. As for juries in a litigation, a similar type of deference to a unanimous verdict is so sacred that it is rarely skeptically questioned without good cause during the appellate process. The legal system’s desperate need for certainty finds it in how laypeople decide an issue—a sacred process not to be disturbed unless absolutely necessary. The previous chapter began by relating humble origins of the word “postmodern” from architecture and music, as well as flamboyant literary criticism.461 These are still relevant to postmodern social and philosophical theories, if not the best and purest source to help illustrate such theories, inasmuch as democracy and law should not idealize the mechanical (architecture) and not prohibit narratives based on a purist assumption that to every era, one “true” narrative will prevail which is newer and more improved than the era", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634244510_cleaned.txt:84:8676476dc16f", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 2344, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634244510_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634244510", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634244510_cleaned", "chunk_index": 85, "text": "chapter began by relating humble origins of the word “postmodern” from architecture and music, as well as flamboyant literary criticism.461 These are still relevant to postmodern social and philosophical theories, if not the best and purest source to help illustrate such theories, inasmuch as democracy and law should not idealize the mechanical (architecture) and not prohibit narratives based on a purist assumption that to every era, one “true” narrative will prevail which is newer and more improved than the era preceding it (music). Postmodernism does not discard legitimation altogether, but can find consensus by majority (if not by outright unanimity) useful as a fallible, intersubjective communicative action, but not as the sacred infallible ritual it is recognized as still today. If the humblest of origins give us a glimpse of postmodernism in its simplest form—modernism representing a sort of social rigidity and postmodernism softening that—we are left with not much more than a political stance relevant only within its historical context. Clearly postmodernism prevailed in forms such as the United Nations, as well as freeing up the arts from an esoteric purism by acceptance of more popular forms of art and music. Postmodernism did not prevail in all the ways Neo-Conservatism prevailed since 1975: capitalism as an ideology, renewed reliance on the military and defense, and a return to fundamental Christianity. The burning question that remains at this point is to what extent will postmodernism be relevant now and into the near future? Has the purity that the Enlightenment represented through the need for metanarrative been supplanted with more tolerance for differing, minority views? What will the role of language games continue to play? Without excessive soothsaying, the term “postmodernism” has probably outplayed its usefulness, based on more than anything the way it has satisfactorily reached its own consensus as to what it is. By its own definition, it should now yield its own sort of metanarrative to other more relevant and controversial narratives. Modern law almost always carries with it a proviso that the appearance of politics in voluble legal opinions is illusion. Of course, that is not so. Our legal system is adversarial by definition, and therefore, zealous advocacy requires that legal actors never break character, even down to the last appeal by the lowest single litigant. In fact, our American legal system suffers greatly from politicization disguised as complex legal analysis. The principle of reliance on impenetrable gobbledygook to protect the layperson who normally can’t understand it also brings with it one of the purest forms of fakery that heated political discussions can be fueled by. As a politically potent controversy with power to be a provocative force in any dialogue about the relevancy of new ideas, postmodernism no longer packs the same punch.

When Fukuyama declared the “end of history” with the falling of the Berlin Wall,462 the statement appeared to even respected intellectuals and commentators to make no sense, so much so that postmodernism was its own voluntary laughing stock. The previous year, the author even recalls his own experience with the controversy that the word could create when interviewing composer John Cage who was appearing in a postmodern symposium.463 Only days later, a memorandum circulated at the otherwise respected and powerful newspaper the author was employed at banning the word “postmodernism” in all future stories—and this was one of Cage’s few moments where he was actually vehemently against a new trend in music.464 Clearly, the language games can still be the source of much controversy, although somehow the 20th-century will always be the time when language, math, and science all became something of a mystery again. That particular initial shock of returning to a sense of unreliability in the universe will no doubt upstage any subsequent shock. That leaves the issue of law, which naturally is bound closely to politics and a theory of society in general. Lyotard also spent much of his postmodernism theories on how technology and computers facilitate the thinking.465 This aspect of postmodernism has now surpassed all expectations from the 1970s with the Internet, offering a free flow of narratives from all over the world and different political points of view. An encyclopedia known as Wikipedia appears to be functioning in a useful way, even without a ruthless process of legitimation that a powerful editor provides. The law has also succumbed to the modern pressures of the Internet and forms of alternative dispute resolution. Together with the still thriving laissez faire capitalism that has driven the decades of postmodernism, the United States stands closer than ever to actually privatizing the law, which undoubtedly would limit access to it for all but the most wealthy. Even Habermas dared not speculate about a future that did not include democracy, but privatization has its own inevitable side effects, such as legitimation that probably would eventually go to the highest bidder instead of any attempt at a consensus (if many things do not work that way already in the United States and around the world). If Lyotard’s differend remains a useful topic in such a context, there would need to be a renewal of the importance of democracy, perhaps even a “neo-democracy,” that would provide a rigorous critique of how democracies have evolved up to now, and especially the real existing differend in America", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634244510_cleaned.txt:86:e856e56ee433", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 2346, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634244510_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634244510", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634244510_cleaned", "chunk_index": 87, "text": "would eventually go to the highest bidder instead of any attempt at a consensus (if many things do not work that way already in the United States and around the world).

Still, before such a neo-democracy movement could be effective, it would probably have to withstand the last moments of a harsh winter. In order to weather such a winter, crawling inside the carcass of a dead postmodernism might help keep any newer, better ideas warm. Postmodernism would have to indeed be dead for that to happen. If likewise summing up the topic of legal hermeneutics in order to put an end to it were possible to do in a conclusive way, it would no doubt begin with the broad claim that the topic is nothing but simply an ongoing affirmation of ancient ideals. This would lead to its own form of “vicious circle” in that hermeneuts are actually originalists, but also that originalists are also hermeneuts. But most of all, it affirms the living nature of texts and their meaning in a way antithetical to Scalia’s way along with his fellow conservatives. That is not to say, on the other hand, that the modern practice of textualism and originalism should be free to practice their own form of hermeneutics based on cutting a tether from past to present. Renewing the process of legal hermeneutics via Gadamer hopefully reinforced the idea that the tether between a law written in the past must keep its relevance to living people, and that interpretation based on phronesis is really the only way that a constitution such as America’s, written over 200 years ago, can still remain relevant and serve all of the purposes that law should and could possibly serve. If the ongoing practice of what has been called all along legal hermeneutics in American common law demonstrates something provocative, it is that heckling goes both ways, as the sarcasm of the California criminal courts has put down in the record, as well as the challenge in the previous chapter to Scalia’s interpretation of “cruel and unusual.” The aporia here may suggest that hermeneutics should remain what it has been (perhaps something based more on Lieber’s version of it), and not to be an instrument that engages in a political impasse that might have several issues such as abortion, segregation, and use of the death penalty,", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634244510_cleaned.txt:87:703ca3ccf359", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 2347, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634244510_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634244510", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634244510_cleaned", "chunk_index": 88, "text": "ways, as the sarcasm of the California criminal courts has put down in the record, as well as the challenge in the previous chapter to Scalia’s interpretation of “cruel and unusual.” The aporia here may suggest that hermeneutics should remain what it has been (perhaps something based more on Lieber’s version of it), and not to be an instrument that engages in a political impasse that might have several issues such as abortion, segregation, and use of the death penalty, attached to it. Still, this has not been the case and probably should not be the case. The advocates of legal hermeneutics have become highly political, and it would be a mistake to disregard any political underpinnings in the Gadamer-Habermas debate, even suggesting the tumultuous political currents of Germany between the wars. When placed into the American political arena, the powerful Neo-Conservative movement strengthened their hand in the 1970s when they dared take the Anarchy card away from the American left and put in in their own hand. They did this under the highly intellectual veil of Libertarianism, as culminating in the title of modern Libertarian Ron Paul’s book, End the Fed. 466 In context of George Washington’s “original intent” of initiating a unified Federal government in 1789 that would never fall prey to political parties or factionalism, it is still nearly impossible to conclusively pinpoint what might be the ultimate political dialogue in modern American politics were it to be simplified between originalism on one side and legal hermeneutics on the other. On the one hand it might be as simple as to say one side wants to end Democratic government and the other side wants to preserve it, even if stretches of time find liberals and conservatives alternating between these two extremes. It might be even something more nuanced, such as the cartoonish debates between Daddy Warbucks and FDR in the musical Annie. 467 In the end, Ricœur’s two-part formulations—of alienation versus belonging, or suspicion versus faith—makes for perhaps an affirmation of George Washington’s position that both sides of any issue should co-exist in a complementary way. Unfortunately this also once again confronts the fallacy of false equivalence, not to mention Lyotard’s differend. If legal hermeneutics accomplishes anything, it is something ambient that is the common law’s built-in safety net. To use it to drive a stake through the heart of textualism or originalism might have its own petty political motivations, but will always espouse something living and human over a text on the page that we should assume died hundreds of years ago. 1 Timothy Williams, New Inquiry of Deaths on Reservation in the 1970s, N.Y.

To get out of this state … there is no other means than the use of Pure Reason by which general morality will be established, which will … dispense with all political supports, and potentiary rulers. This can be done in no other way but by secret associations, which will by degrees and in silence [hidden], possess themselves of the government of the states.… We shall restore the rights of man [patriarchy], original liberty and independence. (Source: N. Bonneville, Illuminati Manifesto of World Revolution, p.p. 53-54) It is important to keep in mind that when they speak of original liberty and independence it is for only one class or group in society: dominant militaristic men. Of course, all this reminds us of Nazism. It is important to see how secret student associations were used to cultivate this belief over generations, eventually leading to the National “Socialist” government in 1933. The eventual creation in 1919 of the Deutsch Gildenschaft which was extremely nationalist and racist, then the creation of the NS-Deutscher Studentbund, which also engaged in paramilitary training of college students and ideological conditioning. In an interesting connection to America, of which we see even more later, out of these student associations also grew the notion of infiltration of the young American republic. As was seen later in the 19th century, as Germany had not been founded as a unified country, they fell behind in the colonial imperialistic conquests of other people’s resources for self-enrichment. What better prize then taking over the independent American state, still finding its legs as a new nation. It was through German immigrant John Peter Gabriel Muhlenberg who studied at Halle, where the Landesmannschaft were a heavy presence, that the Democratic-Republican societies were started in Germantown, Pennsylvania, eventually leading to unforeseen development of partisan politics which was never part of the American founders’ reasoning behind the Constitution and Representative Democracy. George Washington himself believed they were trying to divide America and connected them to the Illuminati. The Democratic Republicans argued against strong Federalism, as noted in the Federalist Papers, of Madison. It is also interesting that in 1832 an American student, W. H. Russell, returning to Yale from his German university studies, founded the Skull and Bones Senior fraternity, which was also mirrored in other fraternities, and like German Nationalist secret fraternities forbade Jewish membership until the 20th century. The membership of the fraternity is heavily connected with the Boston Brahmin, and the term “spook” in reference to being in the CIA derives from the nickname of membership of that fraternity, who comprised a large number of early CIA agents and leaders. An additional interesting note is found in the transcendentalist notebooks of Orestes Brownson, a German immigrant, who accounts how he", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634244916_cleaned.txt:0:5c6155fccc4d", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 2353, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634244916_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634244916", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634244916_cleaned", "chunk_index": 1, "text": "mirrored in other fraternities, and like German Nationalist secret fraternities forbade Jewish membership until the 20th century.

An additional interesting note is found in the transcendentalist notebooks of Orestes Brownson, a German immigrant, who accounts how he was recruited into a secret German order to take over America as he says: “by secret societies under the direction of Bismark and his Italian allies (Brownson 2017).” In many conspiracy theories there is a blanket condemnation of “Masons” as running the world, which was also echoed by the Nazi leadership, at least that leadership faction associated with Hitler, the Austro-Bavarian faction or South German faction, which formally banned many Masonic Lodges after rising to power. So, it is important to look more closely at these connections. German Masonry started in Hamburg in 1737 and then spread from there; eventually, the royal Prussian King became a Mason, although leaving it at a later date. It became associated with the Junker classes as it developed and by the 1930s had developed into a “Humanitarian” Internationalist faction, that was multi-cultural ethnic and religious. Juxtaposed to this was the Prussian Nationalist faction, that was headquartered at the Three Globes Lodge in Prussian Berlin. This Prussian Nationalist faction was allowed to exist in the early years of the Nazi regime, although with neo-Germanic religion supplanting all forms of worship by the Nazis, it also was eventually disbanded. The important point is that in the secret orders of the Masons we again have a liberal tendency vs. a nationalist tendency identified with anti-semitism and a natural ally of Nazi beliefs. Indeed, during World War II the Nazi regime did form a temporary alliance with the Three Globes Masonic Lodge of Berlin in Prussia, which represented the nationalist tendency in Freemasonry whereas the Internationalist tendency was officially banned by the Nazi Regime, because the Internationalists allowed Jews to be members. Returning to earlier history we also see the use of nationalism in the propaganda generated against the Illuminati by rival secret organizations such as the Prussian Rosicrucians, under Johann Christoph von Wöllner, which allegedly took over control of the Three Globes in the 18^(th) Century. It was the Three Globes that convinced Frederick the Great in 1783 that the Illuminati had anti-government anti-religious tracts; the evidence being from the reactionary right-wing Masonic lodges, perhaps an early form of secret disinformation. The Masons are part of esoteric teachings that are common to many lodge-like organizations, partly carried out in secret. As such, their secrecy is fertile ground for secret plans and hidden relationships. For instance the founder of the Ulster Volunteer Force in Northern Ireland, Gusty Spence,", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634244916_cleaned.txt:1:c10a34878a16", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 2354, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634244916_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634244916", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634244916_cleaned", "chunk_index": 2, "text": "was the Three Globes that convinced Frederick the Great in 1783 that the Illuminati had anti-government anti-religious tracts; the evidence being from the reactionary right-wing Masonic lodges, perhaps an early form of secret disinformation.

As such, their secrecy is fertile ground for secret plans and hidden relationships. For instance the founder of the Ulster Volunteer Force in Northern Ireland, Gusty Spence, was previously a member of the Orange Order before being initiated into a secret organization. Of course, juxtaposed to Protestant Orders are Catholic ones. The esoteric teachings also can attract an “imaginative” group of people that believe in supernatural powers; one such group was the Thule Gesselschaft (Society), which does indicate a certain vulnerability to hypnotic suggestibility (see Hitler’s post WWI medical treatment). In 1919, Germany lay in military and economic ruin after signing the Armistice which created a heavy burden on the German Nation. In these circumstances many returning veterans and citizens of Germany begin to look for answers to their problems. One such German was Anton Drexler, who founded the predecessor to the Nazi party, the Deutsche Arbeiterpartei (DAP; German Workers’ Party) on January 5, 1919, with the Thule Society’s Karl Harrer, changing their name in 1920 to the Nationalsozialistische Deutsche Arbeiterpartei (NSDAP; National Socialist German Workers Party, eventually the “Nazis”). An early creator of the Thule Society, Sebottendorff, left before the Nazi involvement in the group. Some members of the Thule Society, Dietrich Eckart (Hitler’s speaking coach and political consultant), Erik Jan Hanussen, Gottfried Feder, Hans Frank, Hermann Goring (also connected to Swedish Royalty, Leader of the Luftwaffe), Karl Haushofer, Rudolf Hess (Minister of Propaganda) and Alfred Rosenberg. Wilhelm Laforce and Max Sesselmann (staff on the Münchener Beobachter) were Thule members who later joined the NSDAP; the Beobachter being the propaganda newspaper of the Nazis. Another member and part of the Nazi propaganda influence machine was Julius Friedrich Lehmann, the publisher and brother of bacteriologist Karl Bernhard Lehmann. In 1900 Lehmann left Switzerland and moved to Germany, where he bought the medical journal Münchener Medizinische Wochenschrift (i.e. Munich Medical Weekly Magazine), which he soon managed to make the most widely circulated journal of its kind in Germany, which advocated for instance “Eugenics.” He established the Deutsche Volksverlag, which he handed over to Ernst Boepple. Lehmann also published the journal Deutschlands Erneuerung (Germany’s Renewal), which was edited by the Pan-German League. Lehmann’s publishing house was an important connection between the German Nationalist Protection and Defiance Federation, the Marinebrigade Ehrhardt, then the Organisation Consul and the German National People’s Party. In 1923 Lehmann took part in the Beer Hall Putsch. He joined the Militant League for German Culture in 1928 and became a member of the NSDAP in 1931.

In 1923 Lehmann took part in the Beer Hall Putsch. He joined the Militant League for German Culture in 1928 and became a member of the NSDAP in 1931. Before the Nazi Party existed, key members of what would become the Nazi hierachy were members of what was known as the “Freikorps.” The Freikorp was an unofficial wing of the German Reichswehr, organized as the “Black Reichswehr.” A brief account of the history of the Freikorps after WWI gives us valuable insight into the founding of the Nazi Party. After World War I, in a war that the victors continue to claim was fabricated by the German Royal family, although there is not convincing evidence of this. Other than certain financial interests being served by a mass war, the German nation lay in ruins. With only a hollowed out, anemic military known as the Reichswehr (Government Military) led by conservative leaders drawn from the historical militarist Prussian population in the East, which today is split between eastern Germany and modern-day Poland. The Reichswehr leadership, most notably under Gen. Von Seeckt, began a secret covert program to fight various threats to their nation, such is in the Ruhr valley, and extending all the way to the Baltics, where minority German populations lived. The Reichswehr termed this underground army the Black Reichswehr; it also became known as the Freikorps (a free army). In 1918, Wilhelm Groener, Quartermaster General of the German Army, had assured the government of the military’s loyalty. But most military leaders refused to accept the democratic Weimar Republic as legitimate and instead the Reichswehr under the leadership of Hans von Seeckt became a state within the state that operated largely outside of the control of the politicians. Reflecting this position as a “state within the state,” the Reichswehr created the Ministeramt or Office of the Ministerial Affairs in 1928 under Kurt von Schleicher to lobby the politicians. The German historian Eberhard Kolb (2005) wrote that “…from the mid-1920s onwards the Army leaders had developed and propagated new social conceptions of a militarist kind, tending towards a fusion of the military and civilian sectors and ultimately a totalitarian military state (Wehrstaat).” A normative historical interpretation based on sociological analysis might try to explain the Nazi rise through angst at economic questions imposed on the German people by outside forces. However, a deeper investigation beyond sociological and anthropological understandings and based on military membership and connections shows that the Nazi movement was a direct outgrowth of extreme right wing German nationalism in the Reichswehr.

However, a deeper investigation beyond sociological and anthropological understandings and based on military membership and connections shows that the Nazi movement was a direct outgrowth of extreme right wing German nationalism in the Reichswehr. For instance, if we take the case of Adolf Hitler it comes as a surprise to many that he was a low level German Military Intelligence agent (Verbindungsmann) sent into the political movements of his day, not just the NSDAP, but he looked into or reconned many different right wing groups before being dispatched to the party that eventually became the Nazis by German Military command. After experiencing the November Revolution and the “Councils Republic” [Räterepublik], the Bavarian Reichswehr Group Commando No. 4, which was established on May 11, 1919, decided to keep an eye on political groups and to carry out “educational work” (i.e., indoctrination) in order to combat revolutionary activities among the troops. Led by Karl Mayr, the Reichswehr’s “Information Department” (Ib/P) was commissioned for this purpose. Adolf Hitler, who had previously belonged to the demobilization unit, joined the “Information Department” as a propaganda writer and informant [Vertrauensmann], and participated in education courses organized by the department. Hitler’s contributions to group discussions caught the attention of one course lecturer, historian Karl Alexander von Müller, who knew Mayr from their school days. Müller informed Mayr of Hitler’s rhetorical gifts. Soon thereafter, Hitler was appointed as a lecturer for an educational course in Lechfeld (August 20-25, 1919). (Weitz 2019) ordered him to have Hitler join the German Workers’ Party (DAP) and build it up. In 1919 the DAP (soon to become the NSDAP) had a membership of around 100 people. In his capacity as head of the intelligence department, Mayr recruited Adolf Hitler as an undercover agent in early June 1919. Hitler’s role involved informing on soldiers suspected of communist sympathies. After this training Mayr issued Hitler the order to become “anti-Bolshevik educational speaker” to the soldiers at the Munich barracks. Furthermore, Hitler was sent as an observer to the numerous meetings of the various newly formed political parties in Munich. Hitler spent much time at the meetings and wrote reports on the political ideas, goals and methods of the groups. This included studying the activities of the DAP (German Workers’ Party). Hitler became impressed with founder Anton Drexler’s anti-semitic, nationalist, anti-capitalist and anti-Marxist ideas. This anti-capitalist sentiment would later be a driving wedge between Nazi factions, the North Ger- mans and Bavarian-Austrian Nazis. Drexler was impressed with Hitler’s oratorical skills and invited him to join the DAP, which Hitler accepted on 12 September 1919. After attending a further meeting on 3 October, Hitler stated to Mayr in his report “…must join this club or party,", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634244916_cleaned.txt:4:5d1bd33d6779", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 2357, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634244916_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634244916", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634244916_cleaned", "chunk_index": 5, "text": "of the DAP (German Workers’ Party).

After attending a further meeting on 3 October, Hitler stated to Mayr in his report “…must join this club or party, as these were the thoughts of the soldiers from the front-line.” In March 1920, Mayr sent Hitler, Dietrich Eckart and Ritter von Greim to Berlin to observe, recon, at close range the events of the Kapp Putsch. On 8 July 1920, Mayr was released from military service as a major of the General Staff of the military district command VII, but reappeared in September 1920 as commander of Section Ib/P of army intelligence. Mayr in 1921 was a Nazi Party supporter, but later became a critic (Wikipedia, “Karl Mayr,” https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_Mayr) In an interesting episode from young Adolph Hitler’s life, it should be noted that, while hospitalized in Pasewalk for treatment of combat wounds consisting of a hysterical blindness that was treated through hypnosis, he heard voices and had visionary dreams related to being Germany’s savior. It has been alleged that his doctor at the time had placed him under hypnotic influence and even used trauma programming on the young man. (Horstmann, 2017) he reconnaissance of the Kapp Putsch by Adolf Hitler is not well known. In early 1920 the leader of the Reichswehr grew weary of the stipulations to disband the German military and re-organize, including the disbandment of Marinebrigade Ehrhardt of the Black Reicshwehr. The Kapp–Lüttwitz Putsch, named after its leaders Wolfgang Kapp and Walther von Lüttwitz, was an attempted coup against the German national government in Berlin on 13 March 1920. Its goal was to undo the German Revolution of 1918-1919, overthrow the Weimar Republic, and establish a Prussian inspired military centered government in its place. It was supported by parts of the Reichswehr, as well as nationalist and monarchist factions. Though the legitimate German government was forced to flee the city, the coup failed after a few days, when large sections of the German population followed a call by the government to join a general strike. Most civil servants refused to cooperate with Kapp and his allies, low government officials staging a civil resistance labor strike. Despite its failure, the Putsch had significant consequences for the future of the Weimar Republic. It was one of the direct causes of the Ruhr uprising a few weeks later, which the government suppressed by military force, after having dealt leniently with leaders of the Putsch. he Beer Hall Putsch was a failed coup d’état by Nazi Party leader Adolf Hitler, Generalquartiermeister Erich Ludendorff and other Kampfbund leaders in Munich, Bavaria,", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634244916_cleaned.txt:5:3cd4f5a21ce9", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 2358, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634244916_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634244916", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634244916_cleaned", "chunk_index": 6, "text": "low government officials staging a civil resistance labor strike.

Approximately two thousand Nazis marched on the Feldherrnhalle, in the city center, but were confronted by a police cordon, which resulted in the deaths of 16 Nazi Party members and four police officers. The putsch brought Hitler to the attention of the German nation for the first time and generated front-page headlines in newspapers around the world. His arrest was followed by a 24-day trial, which was widely publicized and gave him a platform to express his nationalist sentiments to the nation. Hitler was found guilty of treason and sentenced to five years in Landsberg Prison, where he dictated Mein Kampf to fellow prisoners Emil Maurice and Rudolf Hess. On 20 December 1924, having served only nine months, Hitler was released. Once free, Hitler redirected his focus towards obtaining power through legal means rather than by revolution or force, and accordingly changed his tactics, further developing Nazi propaganda. (Wikipedia, “Beer Hall Putsch,” 2021) he creation of the Nazi state is largely credited to the group of politicians, military leaders, bankers and industrialists known as the Harzburg Front, who held a secret meeting on Sunday, 11 October 1931. Chief among these is the banking family of Hamburg and the City of London, Schroeder Bank, who also financed the South during the American Civil War, including arms supplies. It is not without coincidence that plans for the rebirth of Germany after World War II would center on controlling banking and industries under the plans developed by the Nazi SS for a Fourth Reich. The Harzburg Front was a short-lived radical right-wing, anti-democratic political alliance in Weimar Germany, formed in 1931 as an attempt to present a unified opposition to the government of Chancellor Heinrich Brüning. It was a coalition of the national conservative German National People’s Party (DNVP), under millionaire press-baron Alfred Hugenberg with Adolf Hitler’s NSDAP, the leadership of the Stahlhelm paramilitary veterans’ association, the Agricultural League and the Pan-German League organizations. In addition to the leaderships of the DNVP and NSDAP, the SA chief Ernst Röhm, Reichsführer–SS Heinrich Himmler and Reichstag MP Hermann Göring, the meeting was attended by numerous representatives on the right of German politics including the Hohenzollern princes Eitel Friedrich of Prussia and his brother August Wilhelm (sons of the exiled Emperor Wilhelm II) and further prominent members of the Prussian aristocracy, the Stahlhelm leaders Franz Seldte and Theodor", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634244916_cleaned.txt:6:9b55231b00d6", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 2359, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634244916_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634244916", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634244916_cleaned", "chunk_index": 7, "text": "association, the Agricultural League and the Pan-German League organizations.

The non-partisan Hjalmar Schacht, as a highly respected fiscal expert who had resigned as Reichsbank president the year before in protest against the Young Plan, vehemently spoke against Brüning’s economic and financial policy, which caused a great stir. However, most leaders of industry and big business who had been invited to attend were notably absent. Only Ernst Brandi attended. (Wikipedia, “Harzburg Front,” 2021) Before I took this step, I discussed with a number of gentlemen in business and found out in general how the business world felt about cooperation between the two. The general aspiration of the men of business was to see a strong leader come to power in Germany who would form a government that would remain in power for a long time. When the NSDAP suffered its first setback on November 6, 1932 and thus passed its climax, support from German business was particularly urgent. A common interest of business was the fear of Bolshevism and the hope that the National Socialists – once in power – would establish a stable political and economic basis in Germany. (Eberhard Czichon, 1967 Who Helped Hitler to Power? Cologne, p. 78) he Industrielleneingabe (Industrial petition) signed by 19 representatives of industry, finance, and agriculture on November 19, 1932 requested German President Paul von Hindenburg to make Adolf Hitler the German Chancellor. The idea for the Industrielleneingabe had emerged at the end of October 1932 in the Freundeskreis der Wirtschaft (“Keppler circle”; Keppler-Kreis) and was supported by Heinrich Himmler, who worked as a liaison to the Brown House, Nazi Party Headquarters until it was bombed in 1943.

J. Merck & Co., a Hamburg commercial bank. • Fritz Thyssen, chairman of the Supervisory Board of the Vereinigte Stahlwerke. Another interesting connection to the defense sector is that of Gustav Krupp von Bohlen und Halbach attending the 1933 fundraising meeting of Goering to raise money for the Nazi political campaign by rich industrialists, of which many donated, showing industrial support for the Nazi movement. The Deutsche HerrenKlub of rich conservative industrialists fashioned after City of London elite social clubs had an influence on the Harzburg Front, the Keppler Circle, and the 1933 Goering fundraiser. All leading to financial support of major economic forces in Germany being behind the rise of the Nazi state, later Fourth Reich plans developed by Himmler were no different, as he was already familiar with the process of getting economic interests behind the Nazi state from the 1930s, which also influenced his founding of Economic Intelligence offices within the Nazi SS.

Yet, deeper and more lasting socio-cultural ties lay in the Banking families centered around Hamburg and the City of London: Schroeder, Kleinwort, etc., previous members of the Harzburg front in Germany while also having deep banking ties in the United Kingdom. It was through this channel that Nazi post-war plans began to come into view, just as after World War I these same interests had previously planned to raise the German Nation out of the ashes of defeat and create a Third Reich, albeit one with a financial empire at its core rather than a state. The negotiations between German Nazis and British Fascist sympathizers centered in the neutral country of Sweden starting in 1943, with the main parties involved that of Himmler and the British banking interests, ultimately tied to Tiarks banking family. Himmler was a sort of anglophile, often talking of how he appreciated the English way of dealing with colonial subjects; he was attracted to tales of the round table of Arthur as a child, later he even wanted to base his Intel organization on that of the British: Zech talked a certain amount of Heinrich Himmler, and he regards him as a sadist and slightly mad. He is not intelligent and can easily be bowled out in argument, but he has a great deal of peasant cunning. His father was the principal of some school and he himself received a very good education. Zech has heard him talk about the English and their colonial policy. He paints the English as a people who walk about cracking whips and referred to an incident in India where it was alleged that an Indian had struck a British subject. All local inhabitants had apparently been made to crawl on their hands and knees through the village. These incidents are held up to the Germans as something to be learned from the British as the correct method for the Herrenvolk to treat an insubordinate nation. Zech said that he hoped that we would not think that he was merely concerned with giving us amusing and interesting details regarding his experiences. His mind was running on much bigger things.

He said that most people in Germany deplored the atrocities but that very few of them were prepared to do anything. He referred to his circle of friends at home, some of whom listened to the British wireless and longed for the overthrow of the Nazis, but always said “Well, we must wait and see what happens. One day it will all come to an end.” He was convinced, however, that if we treated Germany too leniently all those people and also the army would make preparation for a war of revenge. The whole country needed reeducating from top to bottom, otherwise the glorification of war and prowess on the battlefield would once more recreate a German Army or movements which would be as bad as that which had been experienced during the last ten years.” (Lidell, 2005, 116) This set of reports contains various indications that the German Intelligence Service (G.I.S) had plans for continued activity despite defeat, after the end of World War II. The file includes reports and assessments of the Sicherheitsdienst (SD) attempts to install a “stay-behind” organization in Europe for use behind Allied lines (led by Skorzeny), after the cessation of hostilities, to build a Fourth Reich. One would wonder how they would manage to build a Fourth Reich; according to the interrogations of captured SS agents, this plan involved creating confusion for the Allies, by mainly turning the United States against Russia. Thereby allying themselves with the United States against Russia. Other plans, which would be later echoed in the Black International terrorism campaigns of the 1960s and 1970s, called for fomenting “civil war” in France. It is for this reason that Heinrich Himmler is gradually extending his control. He is further to say that defeat, although not yet a fait accompli, must be regarded as a possibility, and that it is, therefore, important that his followers should take no overt action which would spoil their chances of reforming and playing their part in the preparation for the next war. (West 2005, pg. 220 10 July 1944). Further evidence of Himmler being the leader of a Fourth Reich plan is that of Eastern Front Intelligence chief Major General von Gehlen’s discussion with Himmler’s assistant, Dir. Amt. IV, Gen. Schellenberg (Chief of SS Intel, worked with Jahnke).

Schellenberg (Chief of SS Intel, worked with Jahnke). Later, Gehlen would go on to organize former SS agents into anti-communist West German agents also working with the CIA. Major General von Gehlen in March 1945 asked Schellenberg for a quiet talk in private. One evening he spent three hours with Schellenberg. In the course of this talk Gehlen estimated that militarily a resistance would last another two months. Then the end had to be counted with. Gehlen said that preparations had to be made for this case. The only man with the necessary imagination and energy to undertake this task was Himmler. Himmler should as Commander of the home Army, authorize Schellenberg to build up, together with Gehlen and the best general staff officers, a resistance movement and army on the lines of the Polish resistance…. The evening ended with Schellenberg’s assurance that he would think it all over thoroughly and then secure the decision of Himmler (MI5, 2011, Schellenberg Interrogation). 2. They are counting on differences of opinion between the Allies and foresee an automatic reaction for the peoples of Europe to the “intense Bolshevik propoganda,” and the successes that this might eventually have. By intelligently exploiting the upheavals in this sphere of adversity, they are reckoning on Germany becoming powerful once again, regardless of the ways and means of achieving this. The new GIS is especially relying on the reaction of the big industrial firms to the “communist menace,” and on the support from abroad (Spain, the Hearst Press in the USA) to help with the reconstruction [Marshall Plan] of Germany. (MI5, 2011) [Otto] Skorzeny (from Austria) brought the subject up again by telling Schellenberg in rather condescending manner that the SS Jagdverbande [fighting organization] (north, east, south and west) were all being concentrated in the Alps and were fighting there as commandos. All who could join would have to place themselves under his orders, everything else was rubbish. He and Kaltenbrunner (Austrian SS) were absolutely agreed on that. (MI5, 2011, Schellenberg Interrogation) The progressive break-up of the Reich showed that a disappearance into civilian clothes and corresponding civilian professions, if necessary even in an extreme way (clergymen, monks, etc), was the only thing one could advice others to do. It amounted to an endeavor to save “human substance.” (MI5, 2011, Schellenberg interrogation) It is worth noting that the Ratlines out of Germany through Italy were in part run through reactionary Catholic orders, not with Papal permission, but it does show the cultural strength of reactionary tendencies throughout different parts of society that", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634244916_cleaned.txt:11:42941f4693a0", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 2364, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634244916_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634244916", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634244916_cleaned", "chunk_index": 12, "text": "into civilian clothes and corresponding civilian professions, if necessary even in an extreme way (clergymen, monks, etc), was the only thing one could advice others to do.

It is also worth noting the main resistance was comprised of the Bavarian-Austrian alliance within the Nazi Party, while a North German faction of Nazism was negotiating with Swedish and British financial society. Skorzeny is of interest in Irish politics as he tried to settle in Ireland and was involved in connections to Fianna Fail politicians. The pre-planning and logistics associated with post-war efforts on behalf of a Nazi Reich (Administration) are given in the following interrogation regarding SS AMT IIIB RSHA, “Spheres of German Life” or the Inland-SD, headed by SS-Gruppenführer Otto Ohlendorf, was the SS information gathering service for inside Germany: The agents were to lie low for a certain period after the end of the war in Europe and at a given time were to start organizing “national” movements which would be thoroughly in keeping with the traditions of each country but which would all preach anti-Bolshevism and stir up unrest culminating in civil war. If the cult of anti-Bolshevism were not particularly popular, then any other sore point, such as the burden of supporting an Army of Occupation or of having to cede territory, might be seized on. The main purpose was to make the Allies’ post-war task as hard as possible, so that the Nazi Party could, in time, reappear in a suitable disguise and build up the Fourth Reich. Each movement should also strive to create different slogans, methods of approach to the public, initiation ceremonies [such as used in the creation of C company in Belfast, Ulster Volunteer Force (UVF)], ranks, etc., in order to lessen the risk of the affinity between movements being suspected. (MI5, 2011) The Nazi intended to form a “three-layer” [compartmentalized] organization to control the various movements. The first layer would concentrate on forming a German Schultzinschaft [brain trust] out of Europe and so would direct the high policy. The second layer would be that which had to model the policy of the first layer to suit the various countries. Unlike the first two layers, the third layer might (in carrying out its general propaganda work) become known to the various movements.

Lodge structures are used throughout European societies; for instance we could look at the Lodges of the Orange and Black Orders associated with British Unionism, not to mention the well-known Masonic Orders, some internationalist, some xenophobic nationalist, like Three Globes in Berlin, which cooperated with the Nazi state. The most important espionage function required of these agents is the collection of political intelligence especially relating to anti-Allied underground movements and the position of pro-Fascist and pro-German elements … it is easy to discern Skorzeny’s [sent to Ireland, among other places] overriding anxiety to keep his finger on the pulse of political movements or quarrels which could be used for his purposes. (MI5, 2011) These points taken separately are admittedly not very convincing, but taken together it seems that it must be more than mere coincidence that so many of these names should have come to light in connection with suspicious commercial undertakings working in this country and on the continent before the war and later in connections with the stay behind organization working in Western Europe.… Such phoney firms could equally well have been used to finance pro-German (or even more sinister) activities in England … by doing business with genuine firms. (MI5, 2011) German Communists unmasked concealed Nazi assets and tracked down Nazi war criminals – activities that were often inextricably linked. Disturbingly often, they also uncovered links to Allied interests. They studied individual Länder (states) to see whether there was any substantial difference in the post-war concentration of such Nazi power and influence and discovered the state of Hamburg was unique, not only for its remarkable post-war prosperity. Several Nazi war criminals listed by the Nuremberg trial remained at large in Hamburg, many more than in any other Lander. They were left unmolested by German authorities, and the selective indifference and inertia of the British military government ensured that most remained undisturbed. Their position was doubly secure thanks to the very rightwing Hamburg justice and police departments. In the 1950s the police alone contained thirty-one former SS men, many of them officially named as war criminals. They were employed as chief inspectors, chief superintendents, and one was even chief commissioner in charge of police training.

They were employed as chief inspectors, chief superintendents, and one was even chief commissioner in charge of police training. Their appointments were made so soon after the end of hostilities that the East German investigators came to believe they had been prearranged in wartime. This view was supported by the fact that at the end of the war, most senior SS men and members of the Nazi hierarchy had gravitated to Hamburg. (Thomas, 2002, 118) Confirmation of this East German finding came independently from the American Secret Service in Germany who, in the immediate aftermath of war, concluded that Hamburg was the kernel and headquarters of a well-established SS network. They found that within two years of the end of the war a conference had been arranged in Dortmund to teach the methodology evolved after May 1945 by senior SS personnel in Hamburg. The new organization was structured following the same sub-groups as the original SS. Hamburg was also the first German city to benefit from Himmler’s carefully laid financial plans. Herman Abs, one of twelve directors of the Deutsche Bank, was appointed to the Hamburg branch after the Maison Rouge [red house] meeting as a guardian to thwart hostile Allied intentions and keep control of SS funds. However, the intentions of some of the British finance houses and merchant banks were to prove anything but hostile, even to a bank with such a tainted reputation. Worse still, a remarkably complacent British Military Governor failed to enforce American General Clay’s orders that Abs be physically barred from entering any Deutsche Bank. Despite heated representations, the British did not put into effect any of the banking controls they had agreed with the Americans, which were essential to prevent the Deutsche Bank from resuming its all-powerful position. (Thomas, 2002, 119) …two research institutes within his own SS organization. The first, Gruppe VI WI, studied world economics under Amt VI in a large, scientifically run institute in Hamburg, and the second, based in Kiel, focused on world markets and trade. Gruppe VI WI was created to train hand-picked SS men in finance according to strictly agreed requirements of individual businesses and industrial firms.

The Intelligence Service might be partly military and partly business. Ljunggreen need not fear any German organizations, as neither SD, Sipo, Abwehr or similar organizations could do him any harm, as the “Doctor’s” Intelligence Service was above all of it. When Ljunggreen still declined, the “Doctor” told him that when he had thought it all over, he would get a telephone No. in Kopenhagen which he could call, after this the matter would be settled. It did not matter that the war would soon be finished as they were working far ahead, and the “Doctor” mentioned that an occupation of Germany in a way would cause some disorder, but the very first thing which would be organized would be the Secret Intelligence Service he question of Allied collusion with the Nazi Germans during the post-war is not really open to debate, as such former Nazis as Reinhard Gehlen headed West German Intelligence after the war with the aim of using former Nazis’ professional skills in hunting Communists during the war to having them do it during the “Cold War.” Throughout our research we have seen many Nazis escape under questionable circumstances: Mengele, Skorzeny, and Himmler allegedly never died. We could also point out that such important men of science involved in Nazi Research were never even put before the Nuremburg process, such as Von Verschuer and the public disinformation campaign blaming a subservient Mengele as somehow being the leader of these experiments rather than Von Verschuer. In response to the Red House report, British and American investigators started working in concert from the end of 1944. As they delved deeper into Himmler’s financial maze, they discovered a multiplicity of complex yet expertly concealed transfers of much of Germany’s wealth. The sheer magnitude of Himmler’s enterprise and its breathtaking purpose astonished them. As they mined for information, they were also perplexed by the extent of personal wealth that he had stashed away, minor in comparison with the business ventures, yet disturbing evidence of compulsive personal greed.

In America, the FBI and OSS were the main investigators, backed up by the US Treasury Department and US State Department. They threw massive resources into a top-priority operation in the United States and Latin America, reporting their progress to the Sub-committee on War Mobilization for the Committee on Military Affairs. (Thomas, 2002, 78) Mordrelle told his handlers that he had attended a conference in Deisenhofen near Munich in April 1945. He said that the meeting was presided over by an Obergruppenfuehrer in full SS uniform, comprising 15 representatives from countries west of Germany. Mordrelle said that plans to promote post-war unrest were discussed. At the meeting it was said that ample funds had been planted in South America (mainly Argentina) and trustworthy bankers had been sent to live in Spain and Switzerland. (Thomas, 2002) The fear was that the German political and economic leadership, sensing, defeat, would act to transfer secretly blocs of industrial and fiscal capital to neutral countries, thereby escaping confiscation and the reparations bill. If this happened, German economic and industrial power would be largely intact and would act as a power base from which an unrepentant German leadership could build a resurgent Fourth Reich in 20 years. The military defeat of Germany thus would again be meaningless. (MI5, 2011) One investigation by the US to track Nazi gold was foiled from within; Alan Dulles was part of investigating Nazi financial transactions in Switzerland. Earlier the State Department had been in charge of investigations and intelligence, creating a one-man bottleneck as far as intelligence information and sharing went, while FDR did have his own Intelligence sources to inform him, such as the Astor led network, working for the Naval Reserves. Officially a 16-page article from the Summer 2000 issue of the CIA journal, “Studies in Intelligence” titled, “The OSS and Project SAFEHAVEN, Tracking Nazi Gold” was written by Donald P. Steury, who at the time was a CIA Officer in Residence at the University of Southern California. The article recounts the OSS role (SI–Secret Intelligence and X-2–Counterintelligence) in support of US policy to track, locate, and prevent Nazi postwar control of Germany’s gold and other valuable assets in neutral countries as an Allied victory approached. The overriding goal of SAFEHAVEN was to make it impossible for Germany to start another war. (MI5, 2011) SAFEHAVEN brought out these differences in a form in which they were incapable of resolution.

Jockeying for position reached a peak in August, when Foreign Economic Administration (FEA) official Samuel Klaus [Special Assistant to the General Counsel of the Treasury Department] set out on a factfinding tour of Allied and neutral capitals accompanied only by State Department official Herbert J. Cummings, with the Treasury Department deliberately excluded from participation. It found out anyway, and two Treasury officials set out in hot pursuit of the Klaus mission, catching up with it in London. Klaus grudgingly allowed them to accompany him to Stockholm, but he refused to permit them to continue further with his delegation. Undeterred, the two Treasury Department officials followed Klaus to Spain. This was too much for Klaus, who canceled the remainder of his trip and returned to Washington. The situation was worse in Spain, where US Ambassador Carlton J. Hayes was accused of actively blocking implementation of SAFEHAVEN. It should be noted that in Switzerland, Dulles was supposed to track down German financial interests as head of the OSS in Switzerland, the financial capital of Europe. Liddell’s second continuing anxiety was his deteriorating co-operation with Section V [MI-5] whose inflexible head, Felix Cowgill, had spent most of his career studying Communist infiltration in India and had a highly-developed sense of tight compartmentalisation. Cowgill recognised that ISOS [Intelligence Service Oliver Strachey] with its derivatives was the holy grail, a source that had to be protected at all costs. Liddell, on the other hand, while acknowledging the value of signals intelligence, wanted to exploit the opportunities it offered. As Liddell documented, the two opposing cultures frequently came into long and bitter conflict, and threatened to compromise numerous other areas of mutual interest (Liddel, 2005, 1). n 1933 there was a plot to overthrow FDR, which was revealed by retired Marine Corps General Smedley Butler I to the House Un-American Activities Committee. The tracing back of the plot leads to Wall Street Investment interests, such as J.P. Morgan, who also financed Nikola Tesla. In the 1930s as Fascism swept Germany it too had its adherents here in America, not usually associated with the American Bund, but from homegrown Anglo-Saxon Supremacy. For instance, in one law firm associated with far-right tendencies, Sullivan & Cromwell, Sullivan (Ulster Scots Protestant background) backed neo-Confederate racist social clubs in New York City. Others involved in funding far right groups such as the American Liberty League, the Crusaders and Sentinels, included the DuPont’s, W.S. Farish, Howard Heinz (Mellon Bank), J.

Pratt, Alfred Sloan, E.T. Wier, to name a few. A clique of U.S. industrialists is hell-bent to bring a fascist state to supplant our democratic government and is working closely with the fascist regime in Germany and Italy. I have had plenty of opportunity in my post in Berlin to witness how close some of our American ruling families are to the Nazi regime…. A prominent executive of one of the largest corporations, told me point blank that he would be ready to take definite action to bring fascism into America if President Roosevelt continued his progressive policies. Certain American industrialists had a great deal to do with bringing fascist regimes into being in both Germany and Italy. They extended aid to help Fascism occupy the seat of power, and they are helping to keep it there. Propagandists for fascist groups try to dismiss the fascist scare. We should be aware of the symptoms. When industrialists ignore laws designed for social and economic progress they will seek recourse to a fascist state when the institutions of our government compel them to comply with the provisions. (COAT, 2004) Mind you this is during the period when the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is being formulated and finally established in 1934 in defiance of J.P. Morgan, with Joseph Kennedy as its head, a close ally of FDR, and one of the first Irish-Americans to break through into the political elite, dominated by Boston Brahmin, WASP Americans. American Intelligence, at least in the beginning and probably framing its history for good, is heavily influenced by Wall Street Law firms, such as the founder of the CIA and OSS Bill Donovan, descended from Scottish Unionists. In the coup planning, although Donovan does not appear, his friends and associates do, for instance you can look at the law firm Sullivan and Cromwell, where Donovan worked, as did the Dulles brothers, and its involvement with far-right reactionary tendencies as previously noted. One friend of Donovan’s who served with him in the military is Robert Sterling Clark, who was a grandson of the opium trading Boston Brahmin Cabot family, Edward Cabot Clark, and also heir to the Singer Sewing Co. fortune. Robert served in China during the Boxer Rebellion, was mainly involved with supporting the American Liberty League and the Committee for a Sound Dollar and Sound Currency (CSDSC), which was a Morgan Front", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634244916_cleaned.txt:18:c0c02bce0d06", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 2371, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634244916_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634244916", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634244916_cleaned", "chunk_index": 19, "text": "involvement with far-right reactionary tendencies as previously noted.

Robert served in China during the Boxer Rebellion, was mainly involved with supporting the American Liberty League and the Committee for a Sound Dollar and Sound Currency (CSDSC), which was a Morgan Front group lobbying for the gold standard, rather than floating currency. Included among its members were several Morgan partners and Walter E. Frew, of the Corn Exchange Bank, which was controlled through National City Bank after a 1929 deal engineered by Morgan and exposed by the Pecora congressional investigation. One of the initial meetings between the coup plotters and General Butler was organized by Gerald MacGuire, associate of Clark and a member of the same organization, (CSDSC). Frew personally gave MacGuire $30, 000 for the project under discussion with General Butler. One family that spans the Atlantic with both American and English houses, like many Boston Brahmin intermarrying with British nobility for prestige and to spread their power, is the Mallet family. One of the conspirators to overthrow fellow blue blood, though from New York, FDR, was Grayson Mallet-Prevost Murphy, who ran a stock trading company that employed MacGuire. MacGuire, working with Donovan on behalf of J.P. Morgan, had previously visited fascist Italy and Germany to observe veteran organizations which promoted the Fascist dictatorships, such as those associated with the Black Reichswehr and the Croix de Fue (Fire Cross) which assisted a failed coup attempt in France on Feb 6, 1934. Donovan also gained access to behind the scenes troop movements in Italy and Germany, declaring himself a fascist to Mussolini to gain such insider information. In November 1935 Donovan traveled to Italy, where he met Benito Mussolini; convincing the dictator he was sympathetic to the Fascist Cause, Donovan received permission to visit the Italian lines in Abyssinia, which Italy had invaded the previous month. Donovan spent two weeks touring facilities and interviewing Italian officers. Upon his return to the United States, Donovan – who had traveled at his law firm’s expense – briefed an excited War Department, which had been unable to place spies among the Italian invaders. Continuing to travel as a private citizen and making use of his network of contacts, he visited Germany in 1937 and observed German Army maneuvers; in 1938 he toured the Czechoslovak defenses in Sudetenland, witnessed the fighting in Spain, and again observed maneuvers in Germany. (Linderman, 2016) Grayson Mallet-Prevost Murphy is a relative of the Dulles brothers, was senior vice president of Guaranty Trust Company which financed Mussolini; and is connected to the British Kleinwort Bank that financed Franco’s fascist coup in Spain.

Though named Murphy he is not Irish Catholic, but again of Protestant Scottish Unionist descent. He fought in the Spanish-American War and World War I, he had a metal plate in his head and probably suffered from a traumatic brain disorder. Murphy was on J.P. Morgan’s “preferred client list,” was a director of Morgan’s Guaranty Trust bank and several Morgan-connected corporations. He and his banking house played an important role in syndicating Morgan loans to fascist Italy, for which he was decorated by Mussolini with the Order of the Crown of Italy, Commander class. Researcher, L. Wolfe, notes regarding Murphy: As early as 1903, President Theodore Roosevelt [advocate of Anglo-Saxon supremacy, cousin of FDR] selected him for secret assignments, including planning U.S. military interventions in the Americas. After WWI, Murphy headed the American Red Cross in Europe, which he used to develop a network of informants in European governments. In the 1920s, he made several “fact-finding’” trips to Europe, with “Wild Bill” Donovan who was later director, Office of Strategic Services. These missions, including meetings with Mussolini prior to his coup, were done at the behest of Morgan and London interests. In 1919, Murphy was one of 20 elite U.S. officers who met in Paris with the guidance of J.P. Morgan & Co. operatives to found the American Legion [based on the model of the Croix de Feu]. Murphy personally underwrote that operation to the tune of $123, 400 and solicited additional funds from allies of Morgan in the industrial and financial community. Murphy was “kingmaker” for the legion’s “Royal Family” because the legion still owed him and his friends a great deal of money. (COAT, 2004) The British Mallets are well respected as statesman and military people. The Mallet name pops up in negotiations with Himmler; and is also connected with the German Kleinwort Banking family, which also was located in the City of London, again showing the importance of the City of London financial empire. Lord Thomas writes regarding this connection: The atmosphere [in the British Legation in Stockholm] was petty, childish and demeaning, confessed undercover SOE officer Sir Peter Tennant, the Legation’s press attaché, and he was partly to blame. The problems had started when he noticed that Sir Victor Mallet, Chief of the British Legation, had been holding secret meetings with his friend Marcus Wallenberg, the Swedish financier, and Himmler’s envoy Dr Karl Gördeler.

(Mallet also came from a family of bankers that had ties with the German Kleinwort family who owned the merchant bank of that name.) Gördeler was a constant visitor to Sweden, making some ten trips during 1940 alone, when he was known to have met with Thoma and Calissendorf, wealthy ex-diplomats and prominent members of the Swedish establishment who were involved in peace manoeuvres. According to Tennant, Schellenberg first met with Mallet in March or early April 1943. Before then, on several occasions in January Mallet had met with Himmler’s envoy, the lawyer Dr Schmidt, always in the company of Marcus Wallenberg, and Georg Conrad van der Golz, who left Sweden to work at the Deutsche Bank later that year. Tennant immediately sent a strongly worded report to London, which was … six weeks went by before Tennant first suspected from Mallet’s manner that he knew what Tennant had done. It was not until much later that autumn that Tennant was approached by Robert Turnbull, head of the SOE in Stockholm, with a confidential message from Sir Charles Hambro to “festina lente.” They wanted him to take it easy because Mallet was representing banking interests. By that time relations between the two men were decidedly frosty. Tennant, with some relish, made Mallet a prime intelligence target, while Mallet struggled to maintain his dignity and make life as unpleasant as possible for Tennant. The Mallet connection to the Kleinwort Bank of England shows a continuity of interest between this family and Fascism, the Kleinwort Bank financed fascist Spain. The firm helped finance Francisco Franco’s coup d’état in Spain by approving a credit of 800,000 pounds at 4% interest on 15 September 1937. A month later Kleinworts agreed another loan of 1,500,000 pounds sterling at 3% . (Torrus, 2016). The planning for a Fourth Reich entailed, according to Himmler, the rebuilding of German Industry after the war, one final connection with American fascist activists is that of William Lockhart Clayton who was on the American Liberty League executive committee. Son of a plantation slave-owning southern family with holdings in the cotton industry, he was the author of the Marshall Plan, which financed the re-building of German Industry after World War II, which whether done in concert with German Fascists to rebuild Germany as per Himmler’s plan, or just a coincidence that a far-right American designed the Marshall Plan, the relationship is something to be aware of: that the designers of the re-building of", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634244916_cleaned.txt:21:48f708b596fc", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 2374, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634244916_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634244916", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634244916_cleaned", "chunk_index": 22, "text": "the American Liberty League executive committee.

One other intriguing parallel between the American far-right Anglo-Saxon Nationalists and Nazi Germany is that of the issue of using a formal process in tracking its enemies. The IBM tabulator machines the Nazi’s used to organize the Holocaust and the Prison systems was foreshadowed in the United States in 1926, with one far right group, the Sentinels, boasting that it had “card-indexed more than 2000 radical propagandists making it comparatively easy to check their movements and counteract their activities” (COAT, 2008). In this way the card-indexing used by the Sentinels is eerily presaging a full decade earlier the same card-indexing IBM machines the Nazis used. Some leading industrialists involved in the Sentinels were Raymond Pitcairn, billionaire son of PPG Industries founder, John Pitcairn, Jr., who served as the Sentinels’ national chairman for several years, also the group’s primary benefactor: in early 1935 he single-handedly revitalized the Sentinels with a donation of $85, 000 (more than $125 million in 2008 dollars). To a group which had raised exactly $15, 378.74 since 1931, this was a massive injection of capital. Board members included Edward T. Stotesbury, a prominent investment banker and partner of J.P. Morgan & Co. and Drexel & Co.; Horatio Lloyd, also a partner of J.P. Morgan & Co.; J. Howard Pew, the President of Sun Oil; and Bernard Kroger, founder of the Kroger chain of supermarkets. In 1936 the J. Henry Schroeder Bank of New York had entered into a partnership with the Rockefellers. Schroeder, Rockefeller and Company, Investment Bankers, was formed as part of an overall company that Time magazine exposed as being “the economic booster of the Rome-Berlin Axis.“ The partners in Schroeder, Rockefeller and Company included Avery Rockefeller, nephew of John D., Baron Bruno von Schroeder in London, and Kurt von Schroeder of the BIS and the Gestapo in Cologne founding member of the Harzburg Front. Avery Rockefeller owned 42 percent of Schroeder; Rockefeller, and Baron Bruno and his Nazi cousin 47 percent. Their lawyers were John Foster Dulles and Allen Dulles of Sullivan and Cromwell. Allen Dulles (later of the Office of Strategic Services) was on the board of Schroeder.

Further connections linked the Paris branch of Chase to Schroeder as well as the pro-Nazi Worms Bank and Standard Oil of New Jersey in France. Standard Oil’s Paris representatives were directors of the Banque de Paris et des Pays-Bas, which had intricate connections to the Nazis and to Chase. (Higham, 2007) The complicity of the Dulles brothers is noted by US lawmakers and jurisprudents – it’s alleged that former US Supreme Court Justice Goldberg called the Dulles brothers traitors; he was a WWII OSS operative himself. As one senator noted about the Dulles brothers’ involvement through Sullivan and Cromwell: Senator Claude Pepper criticized John Foster Dulles, Gov. Dewey’s foreign relations advisor for his connection with the law firm of Sullivan and Cromwell and having aided Hitler financially in 1933. Pepper described the January 4, 1933 meeting of Franz von Papen and Hitler in Baron Schroeder’s home in Cologne, and from that time on the Nazis were able to continue their march to power. (New York Times, Oct. 11, 1944) Later, after the war, both Dulles brothers would serve in the Government, with Alan going on to become head of the CIA and John becoming Secretary of State under Eisenhower. Their friend Bill Donovan would play a role in the creation of the CIA after the war as the OSS became a permanent body governing American Intelligence. he founding of the CIA is largely owed to a relationship with secret British Intelligence just before and during the war. It is interesting to note that the US was under pressure from British Intelligence in America to join the war on the Allies side, including covert operations by Britain on American soil. These ops were headed up by a British agent, William Stephenson, a Canadian, heading the British intelligence efforts in America as British Security Coordination (BSC). As one can imagine the intertwining of Anglo-Americans and English is not that surprising. Often professionals were in social circles with common elements of both antagonistic and beneficial relationships depending on these persons of substance’s interests. The state of Intelligence was not just limited to the state, but often involved the use of Private Intelligence, this was common to both Britain, America and Germany, for instance in Germany Jahnke’s J-Buro provided private intel to the SS. In the UK “The Room” club, “The Walrus” club were common names for private intel gatherings of upper social elites. In America, “The Room; the Club – President Roosevelt’s personal intelligence service of upper-class anglophile New Yorkers, led by FDR’s friend and kinsman Vincent Astor.

In America, “The Room; the Club – President Roosevelt’s personal intelligence service of upper-class anglophile New Yorkers, led by FDR’s friend and kinsman Vincent Astor. Astor was a conduit for information from British intelligence to FDR.” (Mahl, 1998, 199) In Germany with the Jahnkeburo ( J-Buro) which provided private intelligence to the SS Amt IV (SS Intelligence), and Jahnke was known as being in charge of Amt IV along with Schellenberg. One example of the intertwining interests, an associate of FDR and a friend of Allen Dulles, was the WWI enemy agent for Germany against America Frederico Stallforth, from a German-Mexican banking family (Dulles, 1958). Though an enemy agent during the war, Stallforth was from the proper social class and continued his life as though nothing happened; he was a back channel conduit to the Nazi regime for FDR’s administration. Differently, Stephenson was not of an upper social class, but had success in the business world, before becoming head of BSC in the US. He eventually became the point man for interface between British and American power including intelligence; a friend of FDR, he was asked to mentor Bill Donovan as the newly minted Coordinator of Intelligence (COI). He went to Britain under Stephenson’s tutelage and Stephenson’s aide, Ellis, to learn the ways of secret intelligence, though Donovan himself had plenty of experience between the wars for the Morgan organization. Stephenson is an interesting person, he was the founder of the “Dirty War” of British Intelligence used during the decolonization of the British Empire, such as that in Ireland. While also found to be somewhat absent minded at times: “Stephenson’s occasional inability to recall things that struck me as ordinarily memorable.” (Troy, 1996, 7) Stephenson was soon a close adviser to Roosevelt and suggested that he put Stephenson’s good friend William J. “Wild Bill” Donovan in charge of all U.S. intelligence services. Donovan founded the U.S. Office of Strategic Services (OSS), which in 1947 would become the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA). As senior representative of British intelligence in the western hemisphere, Stephenson was one of the few persons in the Americas who were authorized to view raw Ultra transcripts of German Enigma ciphers that had been decrypted at Britain’s Bletchley Park facility. He was trusted by Churchill to decide what Ultra information to pass along to various branches of the U.S. and Canadian governments. Sir William Stephenson played a key role in the creation of the CIA. He realized early on that America needed a strong intelligence organization and lobbied contacts close to President Roosevelt to appoint a U.S. “coordinator” to", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634244916_cleaned.txt:24:a7c2376c5155", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 2377, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634244916_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634244916", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634244916_cleaned", "chunk_index": 25, "text": "who were authorized to view raw Ultra transcripts of German Enigma ciphers that had been decrypted at Britain’s Bletchley Park facility.

Sir William Stephenson played a key role in the creation of the CIA. He realized early on that America needed a strong intelligence organization and lobbied contacts close to President Roosevelt to appoint a U.S. “coordinator” to oversee FBI and military intelligence. He urged that the job be given to William J. “Wild Bill” Donovan, who had recently toured British defences and gained the confidence of Prime Minister Winston Churchill. Although Roosevelt didn’t establish exactly what Sir William had in mind, the organization created represented a revolutionary step in the history of American intelligence. Donovan’s Office of Strategic Services was the first “central” U.S. intelligence service. (https://www.ikn.army.mil/apps/MIHOF/biographies/Stephenson%20William.pdf) OSS worked closely with and learned from Sir William and other Canadian and British officials during the war. A little later, these OSS officers formed the core of the CIA. Intrepid may not have technically been the father of CIA, but he’s certainly in our lineage someplace. One scholar that has reviewed this history, specifically looking into the origins of the CIA, has noted about Stephenson and Donovan’s relationship and how it developed: “For us, in the United States,” Declared William J Casey in 1974, “it all began with a New York lawyer who saw his country facing a deadly menace and knew that it was unprepared and uninformed. It’s hard for us to realize today that there was a time in 1940 and 1941, When William J. Donovan was a one-man CIA for President Roosevelt.” (Troy, 1996, 3) Then Stephenson had on that Donovan trip to London, had the royal red carpet rolled out for him, and helped arrange for the second trip, wherein Donovan received an introductory course in British intelligence and unconventional warfare. Then Stephenson, under his SIS cover as director of British Security Coordination (BSC), convinced both Donovan and FDR of the need for establishing COI. maneuvered Donovan into heading the new agency, and thereafter played intelligence schoolmaster to him and his fledgling organization. (Troy, 1996, 5) Thus, it never appeared in the US War Department’s two-volume top secret history of OSS, which was completed as close to events as 1946-47. Nor did it appear in Arthur B. Darling’s CIA history, which was written in 1953, still not too long after the events, but which was shortly thereafter deep-sixed because of official displeasure with it. (Troy, 1996, 5) Even internal historians to the CIA had problems accessing the materials and knowledge, Whitney H. Shepardson, tried to look into the origins of the CIA but: “…Shepardson never moved past the research stage before reported frustration over limited access to documents caused him to throw in the sponge.", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634244916_cleaned.txt:25:260000d43cf0", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 2378, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634244916_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634244916", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634244916_cleaned", "chunk_index": 26, "text": "Arthur B.

Shepardson, tried to look into the origins of the CIA but: “…Shepardson never moved past the research stage before reported frustration over limited access to documents caused him to throw in the sponge. Hence, Stephenson’s name was still lost to CIA history. (Troy, 1996, 6) One of the sticky points with this knowledge is that of Dick Ellis, Stephenson’s confidant and aide, who rather dramatically was revealed to be a Nazi spy, who was responsible for taking Donovan in hand to show the ropes of the Secret Intelligence world in Britain; Donovan who previously confessed to being a fascist. Charles H. (“Dick”) Ellis, deputy to Stephenson, Nazi spy: “Ellis, said Stephenson, was the tradecraft expert, the organization man, the one who furnished Bill Donovan with charts and memoranda on running an intelligence organization.” (Troy, 1996, 7) Now, understand what? Stephenson told me, on my return trip, that “they” – presumably men from MI-5 or MI-6 (British Military Intelligence, Section Five or the Security Service) had questioned him about Ellis’s loyalty. There had been some ‘fuss’, they said, about Ellis having allegedly worked for the Germans before the war. Suffice it to say that by 1966 it had become a very contentious issue within MI-5 and MI-6 and led to what the experts call a “hostile” interrogation of Ellis. Out of that came, reportedly his admission of Nazi, but denial of Soviet, espionage. (Troy, 1996, 14) Nor has anyone speculated on the possible damage done by Ellis to SIS, COI and OSS. Likewise, no trace of Ellis is found in Pavel and Anatoli Sudaplatov’s account of Soviet espionage in the United States during the war years. Still, one must wonder what seismic secrets, such as Ellis’s actual confession, are locked up in British and American intelligence vaults. (Troy, 1996, 15) Thus, we see that the creation of the CIA was a result of WWII operations in terms of the OSS, being based on British models of secret intelligence work, though the main organizers are obviously implicated in being allied with Fascism. Later, Allen Dulles became head of the CIA; it was known that the OSS and CIA were both largely comprised of Boston Brahmin White Anglo-Saxon Protestant aristocracy. As we shall read, the development of the CIA was a contentious issue. “On Nov. 18, 1944, Col. William Donovan had submitted a long and detailed report to President Roosevelt which called for the creation of a permanent central authority for intelligence within the Executive Office of the President.” (Carter 2016, 107) The creation of a civilian intelligence agency was a critical issue to be overcome", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634244916_cleaned.txt:26:bd4c86877f9f", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 2379, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634244916_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634244916", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634244916_cleaned", "chunk_index": 27, "text": "OSS and CIA were both largely comprised of Boston Brahmin White Anglo-Saxon Protestant aristocracy.

William Donovan had submitted a long and detailed report to President Roosevelt which called for the creation of a permanent central authority for intelligence within the Executive Office of the President.” (Carter 2016, 107) The creation of a civilian intelligence agency was a critical issue to be overcome in DC at this time, as it would directly impinge on traditional military oversight of intelligence by transferring that from the military to a civilian entity which would not be comprised of Academy grads but rather Ivy League grads. Army G-2 head General Clayton Bissell authored the most direct challenge to Donovan’s blueprint for a postwar intelligence system. Bissell asserted that the director of this new central intelligence organization would hold too much control over the flow of information and analysis reaching the president, with the inevitable result that the commander-in-chief would be denied a diversity of perspectives and analysis. For their part, the Joint Chiefs of Staff ( JCS) preferred a model in which an intelligence coordinator would report to a council of agency heads who would be comprised of the secretaries of State, War, and Navy as well as the members of the JCS. In follow-up memoranda to key actors, Donovan strongly asserted the advantage for the president of an intelligence community that would speak with one authoritative voice and the need for a director of intelligence who could act autonomously as a general manager of the whole intelligence community. (Carter 2016, 108) Nonetheless, plans for creating a central organ for Intelligence moved forward. In June 1946, General Hoyt Vandenberg [first CIA director] succeeded Admiral Souers of CIG. “During his eleven-month tenure Vandenberg was able to convince the NIA directors to return to him all of the old OSS clandestine intelligence collection units that had been transferred to Army Intelligence when the OSS had been disbanded. Vandenberg merged these espionage and counterintelligence units into an Office of Special Operations.” (Carter 2016, 114) He was consolidating all intel into a central organization, which would soon lead to the act of Congress that founded the CIA in 1947: With the enactment of the 1947 National Security Act, the CIG essentially became a congressionally chartered and therefore more permanent CIA. The CIA was afforded a clearly articulated chain of command reaching through the newly created National Security Council to the president himself. By the time Vandenberg resigned as DCI in May 1947 his intelligence agency had grown from an organization of about four hundred to over four thousand employees. By that time Vandenberg had also managed to acquire the FBI’s former intelligence jurisdiction over Latin America [where the Nazis now regrouped] and had taken over the Army’s espionage and counterintelligence operations", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634244916_cleaned.txt:27:5f27d8632c70", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 2380, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634244916_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634244916", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634244916_cleaned", "chunk_index": 28, "text": "CIA was afforded a clearly articulated chain of command reaching through the newly created National Security Council to the president himself.

By that time Vandenberg had also managed to acquire the FBI’s former intelligence jurisdiction over Latin America [where the Nazis now regrouped] and had taken over the Army’s espionage and counterintelligence operations [no countermeasures independently deployed]. By the summer of 1947 the CIA had already emerged as an all-purpose intelligence bureaucracy, but its emphases were on espionage, counterespionage, and intelligence analysis, not covert action, and no CIA non-ambiguous authority to conduct covert operations, and although the agency was already engaged in some such actions by mid-1947, it was not until NSC Directive 10/2 was issued in 1948 that the CIA was officially authorized to conduct covert political and paramilitary operations. At that point onward the CIA was very nearly the organization which Colonel Donovan had originally proposed as the successor to the OSS. (Carter 2016, 115) On June 18, 1948, the National Security Council created the new Office of Policy Coordination (OPC) specifically to carry out covert political, psychological, economic, and paramilitary operations. The OPC was a hybrid agency that operated as independent service alongside and sometimes in competition with the CIA’s Operations Directorate from September 1948 until it was finally merged into the CIA in August of 1952. The OPC’s director was a State Department appointee, but the agency operated under the joint supervision of the departments of State and Defense. However, the OPC received its operational directions from the DCI. OSS veteran Frank Wisner was appointed to direct the OPC. (Carter 2016, 119) Wisner played a role in creating the Gehlen organization in Germany, which was led by the former Nazi SS General. (Carter 2016, 124-5). Wisner was a University of Virginia graduate and member of the Seven Society secret club, he was involved with the start of the influential Georgetown Club within the world of secret intelligence, primarily comprised of Brahmin Blue bloods working for the government or its direct correlates. He later went insane, which may be an example of psyops directed against him. Once Congress had chartered the creation of the CIA, Truman signed National Security Directive 4-A in December 1947. This directive explicitly authorized the Director of Central Intelligence to conduct covert psychological operations. President Truman followed this in early 1948 with NSC Directive 10/2, which formally authorized the CIA to undertake covert political and paramilitary operations as directed by the NSC. (Carter 2016, 120) lasting legacy of the Nazi interest in subversion and information warfare is that which became known in the fascist terrorist campaigns of the 1960s-80s as that of the use of “intoxication,” a direct output of research by Nazis on turning resistance", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634244916_cleaned.txt:28:edfee0402726", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 2381, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634244916_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634244916", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634244916_cleaned", "chunk_index": 29, "text": "of Central Intelligence to conduct covert psychological operations.

It is explained by Bale as: The French term intoxication, which in general means “poisoning,” is used by Leroy and other guerre revolutionnaire proponents to refer to the “poisoning” of the mind. Specifically, it signifies the manipulation of the political environment by means of the systematic dissemination of false or misleading information to a targeted group (or groups), the purpose of which is to paralyze or otherwise influence that group’s subsequent actions. The targeted group can be relatively small or encompass an entire society. (Bale 1994, 227-8) This was used by the Black International which sought to foment civil wars in France, Italy and elsewhere through false flag operations. For instance, Skorzeny who had been appointed in charge of the continuing fight of the SS at the end of the war, was now leading this movement after escaping Dortmund prison under suspicious – in terms of Allied collusion – circumstances, as noted: “that Skorzeny escaped from Darmstadt prison on 27 July 1948 with the help of a relatively extensive Nazi support network that operated both inside and outside of various prisons and detention centers.” (Bale 1994) He was alleged to have trained Americans in commando arts, then later he was noted as training Arab forces against Israel. He even made an attempt at establishing a residence in Ireland but was rejected by “pressure” from the Irish government, so he was not successful in gaining residence in Ireland. He was later outed in a false flag operation of his in France where he tried to infiltrate Communist groups but was outed by a journalist’s photo. This is not an isolated case; as Bale points out other operatives had the same fate: Leroy collaborated with Guillou at Aginter until his left-wing cover was “burned” by various journalists and he lost his ability to continue conducting “infiltration and intoxication” operations. Others who formed the core group of the action-oriented Ordre et Tradition were Jay S. Sablonsky (alias “Castor,” “Jay Salby,” “Hugh Franklin,” and several other pseudonyms) of Philadelphia, who apparently was affiliated in some way with American intelligence (Bale, 1994, 135) (Kruger et al, 2015) The following passages have particular relevance in connection with the types of terrorist actions that characterized the “strategy of tension”: Subversion acts with appropriate means upon the minds and wills in order to induce them to act outside of all logic, against all rules, against", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634244916_cleaned.txt:29:84cc0cc73204", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 2382, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634244916_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634244916", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634244916_cleaned", "chunk_index": 30, "text": "et Tradition were Jay S.

The means of indoctrinating a subject population is conducted through Psychological Operations (PSYOPS) and is a part of what is known in military parlance as Information Operations. nformation Operations (IO) is a category of direct and indirect support operations for the United States Mili-Itary. By definition in Joint Publication 3-13, IO are described as the integrated employment of electronic warfare (EW), computer network operations (CNO), psychological operations (PSYOP), military deception (MILDEC), and operations security (OPSEC), in concert with specified supporting and related capabilities, to influence, disrupt, corrupt or usurp adversarial human and automated decision making while protecting our own. Information Operations (IO) are actions taken to affect adversary information and information systems while defending one’s own information and information systems. ( Joint Chiefs of Staff, 2012) From a cybernetics perspective it is interesting to note that the mission of IO is both to degrade and protect, through automated self-protection mechanisms, the ability to conduct EW, PSYOP, MILDEC, OPSEC, using automation. The question of whether to always have humans in the loop will come up in later chapters on Cybernetics. A key point is to understand that both attack and protection are envisioned as automated processes in modern IO, which was first carried out operationally during the Balkans Crisis of the 1990s, although Irish Republicans claim it was used in Northern Ireland during this same time, the early 1990s, as we shall read in Chapter 5: automated psyops and IO during the “Troubles.” Electronic warfare (EW) refers to any action involving the use of the electromagnetic spectrum or directed energy to control the spectrum, attack an enemy, or impede enemy assaults via the spectrum. The purpose of electronic warfare is to deny the opponent the advantage of, and ensure friendly unimpeded access to, the EM spectrum.

The purpose of electronic warfare is to deny the opponent the advantage of, and ensure friendly unimpeded access to, the EM spectrum. EW can be applied from air, sea, land, and space by manned and unmanned systems, and can target communication, radar, or other services. EW includes three major subdivisions: Electronic Attack (EA), Electronic Protection (EP), and Electronic warfare Support (ES). Often one will hear the ideal of “Full Spectrum Dominance” in relation to ES. Military and Intelligence is seeking to have the upper hand against adversaries in the Electro-Magnetic spectrum. Botnets are self-replicating computer viruses that can take over a machine for the purposes of attack on other machines. The use of networks of computers, and of humans, is a valuable tool in any offensive or defensive context. The ubiquity of computational devices from the desktop to the hand-held, and now with the Internet, even appliances are vulnerable to attack. Computer Network Attack (CNA) is the use of computer networks to disrupt, deny, degrade and destroy information resident in computers and computer networks. The countermeasures to CNA are Computer Network Defense (CND). Computer Network Exploitation (CNE) is the ability to gather intelligence or data from target or adversary automated information system or networks. Psychological warfare is the coordination and use of all means, including moral and physical, by which the end is attained – other than those recognized military operations, but including the psychological exploitation of the result of those recognized military actions – which tend to destroy the will of the enemy to achieve victory and to damage his political or economic capacity to do so; which tend to deprive the enemy of the support, assistance, or sympathy of his allies or associates. Or of neutrals, or to prevent his acquisition of such support, assistance, or sympathy; or which tend to create, maintain, or increase the will to victory of our own people and allies and to acquire, maintain, or to increase the support, assistance, and sympathy of neutrals. (Roosevelt, 99) Psychological operations is that specialized field of communications that deals with formulating, conceptualizing, and programming goals, and with evaluating government-to-government and government-to-people persuasion techniques. Properly defined, PSYOP is the planned or programmed use of human actions to influence the attitudes and actions of friendly, neutral, and enemy populations that are important to national objectives. The critical variable is, then the perceptions of foreign populations. Propaganda is only the most obvious example of a persuasive communication. (Katz et al, 135) Understanding PSYOP is not a simple task.

Historically, both military and civilian discussions of PSYOP throughout the leadership spectrum have regularly substituted cliches, myths, and untruths for hard evidence or analysis of what PSYOP is and how it can serve our national objectives. PSYOP policy and doctrine have not received their deserved attention while hostile PSYOP efforts against the US are misunderstood and often ineffectively countered. [emphasis added] (Goldstein, 13) As PSYOPS are a general means of attack, in other words, all segments of a society can and are targeted by these methods, it is in the national interest that an informed public regarding these attacks is undertaken. Just as with a bombing campaign, we must not leave the public in the lurch and unaware of these methods of attack against an entire nation. In information warfare a well-informed populace is part of the national defense strategy, as we are really talking about knowledge warfare. Yet, most nations choose to not inform their citizens about such attacks and technology as those countries themselves are using that same highly classified technology against their enemies. Those countries are at a disadvantage in terms of defense as they have no adequate means to counter the threat with the general populace as they seek to use the same weapons and deny their existence or obfuscate about their full potential. The utilization of PSYOPS in WWII by the Nazis is well documented in terms of propaganda and vilification of sub-cultures within the German nation. We all can easily think of examples specifically related to Jews, Gypsies, Leftists, Poles, Slavs in general and LGBTQ people that demonized them. What is little understood is how deep their attack vectors using PSYOPS has extended including into civilian areas of governments of the Allies, through active campaigns of turning agents or even the outright brainwashing of service members. The continuing proliferation of PSYOPS throughout the world’s militaries has also hastened the development of new technologies for these operations. The bygone days of drawing up leaflets are now augmented by cyber PSYOPS delivered via electromagnetic means, first encountered during World War II with the creation of neurological weapons, or neuroweapons, See Ch. 3. …a set of processes employed during the Soviet era designed to mislead, confuse, and interfere with anyone accurately assessing its plans, objectives, strengths, and weaknesses.

When used in peacetime it is a political ruse that can be directed at domestic and foreign audiences, designed to alter perceptions about the Soviet Union and its allies in a desired way. A famous example of peacetime Soviet maskirovka was Operation Anadyr or the secret Soviet plan to deploy IRBMs MRBMs in Cuba in the summer of 1962. Maskirovka is closely tied to the concept of “reflexive control,” which is about manipulating the enemy’s perceptions in a way that the enemy will make decisions detrimental to their own interests - in this case not prevent the deployment of Soviet missiles. Maskirovka includes what Hitler called the “big lie” – a lie so blatant and outrageous that ordinary people cannot believe that their trusted leaders would say something like that, if it was not true. This technique is helped by the fact that in the Soviet Union there was a culture of deceit, which still prevails in post-Soviet Bloc countries, especially their militaries: “Lying routinely occurs at the most senior uniformed levels, even when an argument is clearly untenable or contradicted by obvious facts.” (Krishnan, 2017, 183) As we shall read later, this is a prototype of what USAF Col. Szafraski proposed in neocortical warfare in 1994. Perhaps the most well-known Military deception campaign involved convincing the Nazis that the D-Day invasion would occur at different locations through the setting up of fake camps, logistically centered to the North of the actual invasion site. MILDEC is described as being those actions executed to deliberately mislead adversary decision makers as to friendly military capabilities, intentions, and operations, thereby causing the adversary to take specific actions (or inactions) that will contribute to the accomplishment of the friendly forces’ mission. MILDEC and OPSEC are complementary activities — MILDEC seeks to encourage incorrect analysis, causing the adversary to arrive at specific false deductions, while OPSEC seeks to deny real information to an adversary, and prevent correct deduction of friendly plans. To be effective, a MILDEC operation must be susceptible to adversary collection systems and “seen” as credible to the enemy commander and staff. A plausible approach to MILDEC planning is to employ a friendly course of action (COA) that can be executed by friendly forces and that adversary intelligence can verify. However, MILDEC planners must not fall into the trap of ascribing to the adversary particular attitudes, values, and reactions that “mirror image” likely friendly actions in the same situation, i.e., assuming that the adversary will respond or act in a particular manner based on how we would respond. There are always competing priorities for the resources required for deception and the resources required for the real", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634244916_cleaned.txt:34:31c0808f3b34", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 2387, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634244916_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634244916", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634244916_cleaned", "chunk_index": 35, "text": "(COA) that can be executed by friendly forces and that adversary intelligence can verify.

There are always competing priorities for the resources required for deception and the resources required for the real operation. For this reason, the deception plan should be developed concurrently with the real plan, starting with the commander’s and staff ’s initial estimate, to ensure proper resourcing of both. To encourage incorrect analysis by the adversary, it is usually more efficient and effective to provide a false purpose for real activity than to create false activity. OPSEC of the deception plan is at least as important as OPSEC of the real plan, since compromise of the deception may expose the real plan. This requirement for close hold planning while ensuring detailed coordination is the greatest challenge to MILDEC planners. MILDEC as an IO Core Capability. MILDEC is fundamental to successful IO. It exploits the adversary’s information systems, processes, and capabilities. MILDEC relies upon understanding how the adversary commander and supporting staff think and plan and how both use information management to support their efforts. This requires a high degree of coordination with all elements of friendly forces’ activities in the information environment as well as with physical activities. Each of the core, supporting, and related capabilities has a part to play in the development of successful MILDEC and in maintaining its credibility over time. While PA should not be involved in the provision of false information, it must be aware of the intent and purpose of MILDEC in order not to inadvertently compromise it. ( Joint Chiefs of Staff, 1996) A message targeted to exploit a fissure between a key member of the adversary’s leadership who has a contentious relationship with another key decision maker is an example. That message could cause internal strife resulting in the adversary foregoing an intended course of action and adopting a position more favorable to our interests. ( Joint Chiefs of Staff, 1996) OPSEC as an IO Core Capability. OPSEC denies the adversary the information needed to correctly assess friendly capabilities and intentions. In particular, OPSEC complements MILDEC by denying an adversary information required to both assess a real plan and to disprove a deception plan. For those IO capabilities that exploit new opportunities and vulnerabilities, such as EW and CNO, OPSEC is essential to ensure friendly capabilities are not compromised. The process of identifying essential elements of friendly information and taking measures to mask them from disclosure to adversaries is only one part of a defense-in-depth approach to securing friendly information. To be effective, other types of security must complement OPSEC.

To be effective, other types of security must complement OPSEC. Examples of other types of security include physical security, AI programs, computer network defense (CND), and personnel programs that screen personnel and limit authorized access. What occurs, often, is that data is either leaked, stolen, or hacked online and the enemy has access to and can decipher what that information may say. This is especially true for defensive operational security. US servicemen and servicewomen may have Facebook, multiple blogs, or upload photos, which can lead to the enemy knowing troop movements and locations. With this information, setting up ambush and wreaking havoc on US and support personnel becomes much easier. Geo-tagging features of cellular phones especially, may cause this type of breach in OPSEC. ( Joint Chiefs of Staff, 2006) n a later chapter we will read about the work of Dr. John Norseen, who used the term he picked up in Russia of I “stegobullets,” which was a means of targeting the brain, putting the pipper on point, through mental manipulation using subliminals. It was based on the more common means of concealing information in images. When one considers that messages could be encrypted steganographically in e-mail messages, particularly e-mail spam, the notion of junk e-mail takes on a whole new light. Coupled with the “chaffing and winnowing” technique, a sender could get messages out and cover their tracks all at once. An interesting aspect of Steganography is that it is a means of “secure” communication where the message is out in the open in the form of an embedding in a public image. We will encounter similar concepts later when holography is covered in the study of remote biological influencing. Warfare has always had an effective psychological component, leaders have used degrees of deception (camou-flage), disinformation and other methods to fool their enemies since humans began fighting each other. In modern times, most view World War I as the beginning of a professionalization of these military tactics. Of course Great Britain, being the largest Empire of the time, had the most advanced psychological operations and Intelligence organizations of all the combatants, for instance deploying shock troops and psychological operations against the founding of the Republic of Ireland in 1916, and then re-deploying these assets to the 1920s Palestine Mandate, training Zionist Militias in counter-gang tactics, the Black and Tans in Palestine using Jews to attack Arabs, which was repeated later in Northern Ireland, using Unionists to attack Irish Nationalists.", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634244916_cleaned.txt:36:74b5d034cc0a", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 2389, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634244916_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634244916", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634244916_cleaned", "chunk_index": 37, "text": "Great Britain, being the largest Empire of the time, had the most advanced psychological operations and Intelligence organizations of all the combatants, for instance deploying shock troops and psychological operations against the founding of the Republic of Ireland in 1916, and then re-deploying these assets to the 1920s Palestine Mandate, training Zionist Militias in counter-gang tactics, the Black and Tans in Palestine using Jews to attack Arabs, which was repeated later in Northern Ireland, using Unionists to attack Irish Nationalists. Germany made efforts to keep up, but even though dropping pamphlets was an organized activity, it still did not play much into the German war effort like it did for the Allies. British and Nazi German strategies and tactics in the field have historically been termed “political warfare” and Weltanschauungskrieg (“worldview warfare”), respectively. Each of these conceptualizations of psychological warfare explicitly links mass communication with selective application of violence (murder, sabotage, assassination, insurrection, counter-insurrection, etc.) as a means of achieving ideological, political, or military goals. These overlapping conceptual systems often contributed to one another’s development, while retaining characteristics of the political and cultural assumptions of the social system that generated it. (Simpson, 1994, 11) The scientific study of Psyops began in America with the work of Harold Lasswell who in 1926 published Propaganda Techniques in the World War. Lasswell went on to be a key researcher in psychological operations research for the American Military. Chris Simpson in his book, The Science of Coercion writes, “the study of psychological warfare is in part a look at how powerful elites manage change, reconstitute themselves in new forms, and struggle – not always successfully – to shape the consciousness of audiences that they claim as their own.” (Simpson, 1994). He draws out the history of research in this area and its sponsorship by wealthy clients, such as the Ford Foundation and Rockefeller Foundations, as well as the Security State, as a scientific methodology was applied to the subject field: U.S. military, propaganda, and intelligence agencies favored an approach to the study of mass communication that offered both an explanation of what communication “is” (at least insofar as those agencies’ missions were concerned) and a box of tools for examining it. Put most simply, they saw mass communication as an instrument for persuading or dominating targeted groups. They understood “communication” as little more than a form of transmission into which virtually any type of message could be plugged (once one had mastered the appropriate techniques) to achieve ideological, political, or military goals. Academic contractors convinced their clients that scientific dissection and measurement of the constituent elements of mass communication would lead to the development of powerful new tools for social management, in somewhat the same way earlier science had paved the way for penicillin, electric lights, and the atom bomb. Federal patrons meanwhile believed that analysis of audiences and communication effects could improve ongoing", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634244916_cleaned.txt:37:0bf2b2a0bd68", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 2390, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634244916_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634244916", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634244916_cleaned", "chunk_index": 38, "text": "message could be plugged (once one had mastered the appropriate techniques) to achieve ideological, political, or military goals.

Federal patrons meanwhile believed that analysis of audiences and communication effects could improve ongoing propaganda and intelligence programs. (Simpson, 1994, 5-6) Lasswell was a recipient of many funding dollars from the Security State as well as these Foundations. He is famous in communication theory for his dictum: “Who says what to whom with what effect.” Applying a scientific method to communications theory for the purpose of control was a key element in the promulgation of this research. Creating a reductionist model for research where positivistic outlooks took center stage: For Lasswell, the study of all social communication could be reduced to “who says what to whom with what effect” – a dictum that is practically inscribed in stone over the portals of those U.S. colleges offering communication as a field of study. This was a seemingly simple, logical approach to analysis of communication, but it carried with it sweeping implications. Lippmann and Lasswell’s articulation of communication-as-domination permitted a significant step forward in applying a positivist scientific method to the study of social communication. Positivism has traditionally been based in part on taking complex, unmeasurable phenomena and breaking them up into discrete parts, measuring those parts, and bit by bit building up a purportedly objective understanding of the phenomenon as a whole. Its early applications in the social sciences in the United States had been pioneered at the University of Chicago, Columbia University, and other academic centers. New measurement techniques of this sort often have substantial impact on society outside of academe, however. In this case, Lasswell’s formulation dovetailed so closely with emerging commercial and political forces in the United States that his slogan became the common wisdom among U.S. social scientists almost overnight. By reducing communication to the Lasswellian model of who says what, et cetera, it became possible for the first time to systematically isolate and measure those aspects of communication that were of greatest relevance to powerful groups in U.S. society. (Simpson, 1994, 19) Lippmann’s career during these years illustrates a phenomenon that was to become much more common in the aftermath of World War II: He was an intellectual who shaped psychological strategy during the war itself, and then helped integrate that experience into the social sciences once most of the shooting was over. Lippmann’s highly influential concept of the “stereotype,” for example, contended that new communication and transportation technologies had created a “world that we have to deal with politically [that is] out of reach, out of sight, out of", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634244916_cleaned.txt:38:db0059921e46", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 2391, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634244916_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634244916", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634244916_cleaned", "chunk_index": 39, "text": "that was to become much more common in the aftermath of World War II: He was an intellectual who shaped psychological strategy during the war itself, and then helped integrate that experience into the social sciences once most of the shooting was over. Lippmann’s highly influential concept of the “stereotype,” for example, contended that new communication and transportation technologies had created a “world that we have to deal with politically [that is] out of reach, out of sight, out of mind.” The “pictures in our heads” of this world – the stereotypes – ’’ are acted upon by groups of people, or by individuals acting in the name of groups.” The complexity and pace of the new world that Lippmann envisaged, together with the seeming ease with which stereotypes could be manipulated for political ends, led him to conclude that “representative government … cannot be worked successfully, no matter what the basis of election, unless there is an independent, expert organization for making the unseen facts [of the new world] intelligible to those who have to make the decisions.” The converse of that proposition was that decision makers had a responsibility to repair the “defective organization of public opinion,” as Lippmann put it, in the interests of social efficiency and the greater good. These concepts, first introduced in Public Opinion, are illustrated throughout that text with references to Lippmann’s wartime experiences as a propagandist and intelligence specialist. (Simpson, 1994, 17) Yet, Lippman was viewed as a progressive in his time; a police reformer in Denver after the war, his theories were supposed to steer the country toward greater equality or equilibrium rather then become an instrument of hidden power. On the other hand, we have Lasswell, who advocated “those with money… should systematically manipulate mass sentiment from Nazis and Communists” (Simpson, 1994, 23). Lasswell writes that the spread of literacy: …did not release the masses from ignorance and superstition but altered the nature of both and compelled the development of a whole new technique of control, largely through propaganda. . . [A propagandist’s] regard for men rests on no democratic dogmatisms about men being the best judges of their own interests. The modern propagandist, like the modern psychologist, recognizes that men are often poor judges of their own interests . . . [Those with power must cultivate] sensitiveness to those concentrations of motive which are implicit and available for rapid mobilization when the appropriate symbol [semiotic] is offered . . . [The propagandist is] no phrasemonger but a promoter of overt acts. (Simpson, 1994, 21) Which presages the “Reflexive Control” of later theories.

Having a small class speaking for the entire nation does seem to be counterproductive; nonetheless, with Rockefeller Foundation money behind him, he knew who was funding his research. The scientific application of communications theory to psychological operations did not go uncriticized at the time, as was pointed out by Simpson: One Rockefeller seminar participant, Donald Slesinger (former dean of the school of social science at the University of Chicago), blasted Lasswell’s claims as using a democratic guise to tacitly accept the objectives and methods of a new form of authoritarianism. “We [the Rockefeller seminar] have been willing, without thought, to sacrifice both truth and human individuality in order to bring about given mass responses to war stimuli,” Slesinger contended. “We have thought in terms of fighting dictatorships-by-force through the establishment of dictatorship-by-manipulation.” Slesinger’s view enjoyed some support from other participants and from Rockefeller Foundation officers such as Joseph Willits, who criticized what he described as authoritarian or even fascist aspects of Lasswell’s arguments. Despite this resistance, the social polarization created by the approaching war strongly favored Lasswell, and in the end he enjoyed substantial new funding and an expanded staff courtesy of the foundation. Slesinger drifted away from the Rockefeller seminars and appears to have rapidly lost influence within the community of academic communication specialists. (Simpson, 1994, 23) After the start of World War II we have the creation in the United States of offices dedicated to psychological operations with one of the mainstays of the work the ex-Wall Street lawyer Bill Donovan, who previously had done Intelligence work in Europe. In July 1941 FDR created the aptly named Office of the Coordinator of Information, placing Donovan in charge. He adopted Nazi psyops to an “Americanized” version: The phrase “psychological warfare” is reported to have first entered English in 1941 as a translated mutation of the Nazi term Weltanschauungskrieg (literally, worldview warfare), meaning the purportedly scientific application of propaganda, terror, and state pressure as a means of securing an ideological victory over one’s enemies. William “Wild Bill” Donovan, then director of the newly established U.S. intelligence agency Office of Strategic Services (OSS), viewed an understanding of Nazi psychological tactics as a vital source of ideas for “Americanized” versions of many of the same stratagems. Use of the new term quickly became widespread throughout the U.S. intelligence community. For Donovan psychological warfare was destined to become a full arm of the U.S. military, equal in status to the army, navy, and air force. Donovan was among the first in the United States to articulate a more or less unified theory of psychological warfare. As he saw it, the “engineering of consent” techniques used in peacetime propaganda campaigns could", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634244916_cleaned.txt:40:e327f4484c52", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 2393, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634244916_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634244916", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634244916_cleaned", "chunk_index": 41, "text": "versions of many of the same stratagems.

Donovan was among the first in the United States to articulate a more or less unified theory of psychological warfare. As he saw it, the “engineering of consent” techniques used in peacetime propaganda campaigns could be quite effectively adapted to open warfare. Pro-Allied propaganda was essential to reorganizing the U.S. economy for war and for creating public support at home for intervention in Europe, Donovan believed. Fifth-column movements could be employed abroad as sources of intelligence and as morale-builders for populations under Axis control. He saw “special operations – meaning sabotage, subversion, commando raids, and guerrilla movements – as useful for softening up targets prior to conventional military assaults. “Donovan’s concept of psychological warfare was all-encompassing,” writes Colonel Alfred Paddock, who has specialized in this subject for the U.S. Army War College. “Donovan’s visionary dream was to unify these functions in support of conventional (military) unit operations, thereby forging a ‘new instrument of war.’” (Simpson 1994) Black propaganda was the term used for covert psychological operations; when the OSS was created and Donovan placed as its head, black propaganda was moved to the OSS. Another Wall Street lawyer and friend of Donovan, John J. McCloy, descended from Scottish Unionists, who would later head the Warren Commission, was head of the Army’s G2 Intelligence Division’s psychological operations department during the war. After the war, Donovan spearheaded the creation of a full-time covert Intelligence group in the United States based on the model of British Secret Intelligence. The advocated Central Intelligence Group was created in 1946 with Gen. Hoyt Vandenburg as it’s leader. Then in 1947 the Central Intelligence Agency was created. The years 1946-50 saw the creation of a secret bureaucracy for conducting clandestine warfare, including psychological operations, whose existence was denied for some 30 years in public discourse. In 1947 a layered approach was created for psychological operations with National Security Council directive 4A, which created an overt psychological operations program which “must be supplemented by covert psychological operations” (Simpson, 1994, 38). Later the Office of Policy Coordination was created, led by former Wall Street lawyer, and friend of Donovan and of fraternity brother Dulles, Frank Wisner. An assistant to Wisner when at the State Department was Hans Speier who advocated for martial law: He contended that the U.S. government should prepare immediately to “impos[e] martial law [in the United States] to guard against defeatism, demoralization and disorder,” if that proved necessary. More urgent in Speier’s mind, however, was activation of a strong “offensive” program designed to overthrow rival regimes. “Subversion [is the] aim of strategic propaganda,” Speier wrote. “The United States … can wage", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634244916_cleaned.txt:41:0f08f41a9b02", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 2394, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634244916_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634244916", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634244916_cleaned", "chunk_index": 42, "text": "Frank Wisner.

More urgent in Speier’s mind, however, was activation of a strong “offensive” program designed to overthrow rival regimes. “Subversion [is the] aim of strategic propaganda,” Speier wrote. “The United States … can wage sincere political subversion propaganda against the dictatorial Soviet regime, particularly in the political realm.… Planning and preparation for strategic propaganda in a future war must begin now.” Thus by the end of the 1940s Speier, McGranahan, and other prominent communication research specialists used the pages of POQ [Public Opinion Quarterly] to call on U.S. security agencies to employ state-of-the-art techniques to facilitate the overthrow of governments of selected foreign countries in a “future” war – the preparations for which should begin immediately. Speier’s program included coercive measures, even the imposition of martial law, to ensure that the U.S. population cooperated. Although Speier presented his argument in the form of a proposal, it is today known from the declassified records of the National Security Council that many of the measures he recommended were in fact actually under way at the time his article appeared. (Simpson, 1994, 48) n the mid-1990s, as the Internet became a small part of information exchange available to the public, albeit on a I much smaller scale than today, discussion of cyberwarfare started to make its way into conversations regarding defense. One military strategist in this area was Col. Szafranski who postulated the extension of psychological operations into what he termed ‘Neocortical Warfare’: As the right and left brains interact, the enemy is not seen as an inorganic system with multiple centers of gravity, but as other neocortical organisms. Neocortical warfare is warfare that strives to control or shape the behavior of enemy organisms, but without destroying the organisms. It does this by influencing, even to the point of regulating, the consciousness, perceptions and will of the adversary’s leadership: the enemy’s neocortical system. In simple ways, neocortical warfare attempts to penetrate adversaries’ recurring and simultaneous cycles of “observation, orientation, decision and action [OODA Loop].” In complex ways, it strives to present the adversary’s leaders – its collective brain – with perceptions, sensory and cognitive data designed to result in a narrow and controlled (or an overwhelmingly large and disorienting) range of calculations and evaluations. The product of these evaluations and calculations are adversary choices that correspond to our desired choices and the outcomes we desire. Influencing leaders to not fight is paramount. Warfare is “organized” fighting. It becomes less organized, more nonlinear, more chaotic and unpredictable once it begins. Until battle (physical fighting) begins, the leaders can stop it more easily.

Until battle (physical fighting) begins, the leaders can stop it more easily. In very complex ways, the neocortical approach to warfare influences the adversary leaders’ perceptions of patterns and images, and shapes insights, imaginings and nightmares. This is all brought about without physical violence. It is all designed to reorganize and redefine phenomenological designators to lead the enemy to choose not to fight. In neocortical warfare, enemy minds are the Schwerpunkt [center of gravity] and armed military capability the Nebenpunkte (a term coined by John Boyd to mean “anything that is not the Schwerpunkt”). (Szafranski, 1994, 404) Col. Szafranski wrote this shortly after the fall of the Soviet Union and the movement westward of many Russian scientists, like Lefebvre, and their ideals regarding Reflexive Control entered the US defense mental space. Clearly, this was an early writing of what would be more commonly referred to as Neuro-warfare. Another concept from this passage is the work of John Boyd in the OODA Loop. John Boyd was a USAF Colonel who was a renowned air engagement expert, claiming he could down any enemy aircraft in 40 seconds or less. He postulated the OODA loop based on the need to act decisively and quickly in supersonic jet engagements, although this may not necessarily be the case in all situations; for example, Submarine warfare. Szafranski quotes Boyd: Boyd, “A Discourse on Winning and Losing,” suggests that the way to win is to operate (that is, to observe, get oriented, decide and act) more quickly than an adversary. Ways to do this include depriving the adversary of essential information, overloading the adversary with puzzling or difficult to interpret information, using the adversary’s “genetic heritage” or “cultural tradition” so that the enemy is self-disconcerted or self-deceived, frustrating adversary actions, or denying the enemy feedback, or accurate feedback on the consequences of action taken. All of this is designed to “generate uncertainty, confusion, disorder, panic, chaos…” and shatter cohesion, produce paralysis, and bring about collapse.” Because the real province of conflict is the mind, all warfare is neocortical warfare. (Szafranski, 1994, 414) His ideals gained wide traction with certain sections of National Defense. It is fitting that Machine Learning would be deployed in the OODA Loop given AI’s ability to do things exponential degrees faster than a human, yet a bad model or misinterpretation of the environment could lead to a more rapid driving of the train off the tracks and possibly forbid any capability of correction.

Neocortical warfare here, ostensibly is an extrinsic means of changing one’s internal mind. Although, it does presage the work of Dr. John Norseen where direct manipulation of the neocortex is the manner of changing or altering minds rather than through extrinsic means such as subliminal messaging. One way that Col. Szafranski suggested doing this was the use of Neuro-Linguistic Programming: Knowing what the adversary values and using the adversary’s own representational systems allows us to correlate values, to communicate with the minds of enemies in the verbal and nonverbal language of the enemy. The objective is to shape the enemy’s impressions as well as the enemy’s initiatives and responses, pacing the enemy through the cycle of observation, orientation, decision and action [OODA Loop]. (Szafranski, 1994, 405) 2. Adversaries will wage ongoing neocortical warfare against us. “Neocortical warfare uses language, images and information to assault the mind, hurt morale and change the will. It is prosecuted against our weaknesses or uses our strengths to weaken us in unexpected and imaginative ways. That being the case, we have less room for the unimaginative, the mentally weak, or whatever Cohen and Gooch mean by the psychologically crippled among our leaders. Leaders are critical nodes, the targets of neocortical warfare, and they must be prepared for the adversary’s assaults.” (Szafranski, 1994, 407) Clearly neocortical warfare was envisioned as an ongoing and pervasive effort to secure American National Interests. It is a good question as to what extent, especially given the NSA spying on allies like Germany’s Prime Minister, this effort at conditioning and controlling minds is still ongoing. Col. Szafranski wrote about the broad brush that Information Warfare could use on a society, sweeping up both combatants and non-combatants. Dr. James Giordano, US DoD consultant on the ethics of neuroweapons, has written extensively on the use of narrative networks in what is known as NEURINT Neuro-cognitive Intelligence in the sense of espionage. He notes regarding NEURINT: “Assessment of neuro-psychosocial factors in narratives, individual and group expressions and activities.” He has also lectured on the Cyber-linked neurocognitive manipulation, of which more is written below (see BCI section). Returning to the notion of Narrative Networks Krishnan and Giordano have both referenced the DARPA sponsored work of Dr. Casebeer. Krishnan relates regarding narrative network utilization: Narratives Networks use a method based on Neuro Linguistic Programming to rewire human neural networks in much the way that the East German Stasi sought to use Zertsetzung in conditioning", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634244916_cleaned.txt:44:2975b5702a71", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 2397, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634244916_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634244916", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634244916_cleaned", "chunk_index": 45, "text": "individual and group expressions and activities.” He has also lectured on the Cyber-linked neurocognitive manipulation, of which more is written below (see BCI section).

Krishnan relates regarding narrative network utilization: Narratives Networks use a method based on Neuro Linguistic Programming to rewire human neural networks in much the way that the East German Stasi sought to use Zertsetzung in conditioning dissidents to become socially acceptable within a totalitarian world view. As is seen from the work of Dr. Casebeer it is clear that linguistics is being used to interfere with people’s brain states to recondition them. It can also be used to provide disinformation and defamation about targeted individuals. While also being used by the CIA in 1951 in trying to create a hypnotized person that will not only carry out acts contrary to their morals but also will not have any memory of them, undergoing amnesia, or erasure of short term memory, the proverbial “Manchurian candidates” (Krishnan 2017, 21) or “sleeper agents.” (Krishnan 2017, 37). Dr. James Giordano talks about the use of narrative networks: …we’re targeting the brain and we’re talking the brain at a variety of levels now like any good target what I have to be able to do is I need to put the Pipper on point in other words I need to put this gun site so to speak where I want it to be … I have to recon my target area quite well so as to be able to acquire viable targets and also to avoid collateral damage. The assessment neuro-technologies do a very good job doing that with increasing sophistication they’re not used individually they’re used in a way that’s called co-registered. I can use forms of neuro-imaging and these are diverse they run the gamut from the older forms such as things like computerized tomography and single photon emission tomography to the much newer forms that utilize a highly specific electromagnetic pulse signal not only to be able to image certain brain areas but also to image tracts communicating networks and nodes within the brain in a directional way and in rather rapid time. I can utilize near a physiological recordings such as electroencephalography, and I’ve dialed in the specificity of that as well, through the use of quantitative techniques. I can also look at neuro-genomics and neuro-genetics taking a look at genetic profiles of individuals and groups to be able to determine what genes may be in fact coding for certain structures and functions of the brain. I can utilize proteomics and other forms of biomarkers and I can utilize Neurosci informatics. In other words, I can harness all of these forms of assessments to a big data approach that allow me to make both comparatives and normative indices", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634244916_cleaned.txt:45:5c7da33ab3a2", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 2398, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634244916_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634244916", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634244916_cleaned", "chunk_index": 46, "text": "I can also look at neuro-genomics and neuro-genetics taking a look at genetic profiles of individuals and groups to be able to determine what genes may be in fact coding for certain structures and functions of the brain.

In other words, I can harness all of these forms of assessments to a big data approach that allow me to make both comparatives and normative indices not only within an individual but between individuals; not only between individuals but within and between groups on a variety of scales. So the idea of assessment technology in many ways combines each and all of these … fortified through the use of big data we’ve written comprehensively about the use of big data as a force multiplier in neuroscience and neural weaponology. …but the idea here is like so many other forms of recon and evaluation and assessment we as humans tend not to turn rocks over just to look what’s under side we turn rocks over so we can use what’s under there, the brain is no different. If what I’m doing is I’m trying to put a pipper [gun sight] on target and make sure it’s we’re on points I want to do something with that this is not just a let’s go see mission this is a let’s go see so that ultimately we can translate this into some viable effect, either of the knowledge or to actually target these things to the use of some technique or technology. Now we’re looking at is the interventional techniques do not ignore cyber because power some knowledge and information and if I understand how a brain works and how neurocognitive mechanisms are operative in the various impressions we then gain in our thoughts emotions that may ultimately feed into behaviors, I can manipulate the type of information and its delivery so as to be able to influence brain state. This is part of the incentive and underlying rationale and methods that were employed in a DARPA program called narrative networks that was led by a colleague of mine, Dr. William Casebeer, exactly doing that, the more we know about the way a brain works the more we can utilize said information to develop key narratives of psychological and MISO [Military Information Support Operations] operations that are then viable to be able to then be used to influence individual and group brains. We’ve done this for a long time this is also referred to incidentally as neuro-marketing. (Giordano, 2017, timestamp: 15:04) The use of narrative networks has most recently come to public attention through the alleged Russian interference in the US elections and the Brexit votes in the United Kingdom through the company Cambridge Analytica, with heavy ties to UK Secret Intelligence Service (SIS) which is just one part", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634244916_cleaned.txt:46:34127d6ff92e", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 2399, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634244916_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634244916", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634244916_cleaned", "chunk_index": 47, "text": "to be able to then be used to influence individual and group brains.

Ironically, my Facebook data was stolen and imported into the Cambridge Analytica scheme. Krishnan notes regarding these manipulations of Facebook that it was the UK SIS that in 2011 sponsored a study on this Intelligence method: …the British intelligence service GCHQ commissioned in 2011 a study by behavioral scientist Mandeep Dhami from then Cambridge University, to improve the art of Internet Trolling. In the study the following methods are suggested “to discredit, promote distrust, dissuade, deter, delay or disrupt” – upload YouTube videos containing “persuasive communications, setting up Facebook groups, forums, blogs and Twitter accounts, establishing online aliases/personalities, providing spoof online resources, sending spoof e-mails and text messages from a fake person or mimicking a real person,” etc. (Krishnan 2017, 135) As mentioned earlier the latest trend in neuroweapons is to move control and handling of those on the receiv-ing end of neuroweapon targeting to use Automation, Cybernetics and Artificial Intelligence. Russian scien-…psychotronic weapons can be used to take away part of the information which is stored in a person’s brain and send it to a computer which reworks it to the level needed to control the person (Begich 2006, Ch. 2) A Brain-Computer-Interface is any device that bridges the brain to a computer for processing, though usually an external device or invasive technology, it is now a non-invasive wave based non-device technology. It is very well known now that EEG can be used to control a computer interface with human thought alone with no other input devices other than brainwaves. Krishnan notes that both DARPA and IARPA are working to directly connect human brains to computers. (Krishnan 2017, 69) Adding artificial intelligence to the equation allows the controlling of targets more efficiently and effectively: Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) are altering the landscape of security risks for citizens, organizations, and states. Malicious use of AI could threaten digital security (e.g., through criminals training machines to hack or socially engineer victims at human or superhuman levels of performance), physical security (e.g., non-state actors weaponizing consumer drones), and political security (e.g., through privacy-eliminating surveillance, profiling, and repression, or through automated and targeted disinformation campaigns).

(Brundage et al, 2018, 4) In fact, Targeted Individuals have noticed that many people who seem to be stalking, following and otherwise surveilling them have the tendency to stare at their smartphones as though in a hypnotic trance. This may be due to a computer virus that is known to cyber security specialists as Russian Virus 666 (Krishnan 2017, 133). Using a hypnotic method based on the 25^(th) frame effect, first written in the 1920^(′)s in the Soviet Union, as noted by Kazhinsky. This has also been noted by Krishnan and Begich. This 25^(th) frame effect inserts hypnotic suggestions into a 25^(th) frame of films and computer screens. The virus has been found most recently in computing and television programming during the Ukraine conflict. Behavior modification using computers is nothing new; in fact, such technology as demonstrated publicly by Russian researcher Dr. Smirnov to the CIA, DOD, etc. in the 1990s used a computer screen to show different subliminal messages using the 25^(th) frame effect (Krishnan 2017, 94). Other systems that employ such abilities are known to be on the public market, noted as Psi Tech and MRU (Begich 2006, 81-2), while others note that systems such as these are available on the black market. Information Warfare including its parts in Information Operations, Psychological Operations and Neocortical Warfare, which is the beginning of neuro-warfare, have been used by not just military operatives but also intelligence and even business operatives to force their will onto others against their own wishes. As we shall see in the next section, the trajectory of the development of neuro-warfare takes on an even more hard science approach in the effort to force one’s will onto others and have them submit to your will whether as a military or as a national intelligence. This form of warfare leads to some of the most sinister totalitarian forms of government in history.

I do not discuss American or Western developments in these areas as this is well covered in Krishnan 2017. I do cover below the Nazi and Soviet roots of this technology and the general early history of the development of these weapons from the 1910s. …the claim is made that neuroweaponry encompasses all forms of interlinked cybernetic, neurological, and advanced biotech systems, along with the use of synthetic biological formulations and merged physiobiological and chemical scientific arrangements, designed expressly for offensive use against human beings. Neuroweapons are intended to influence, direct, weaken, suppress, or neutralize human thought, brainwave functions, perception, interpretation, and behaviors to the extent that the target of such weaponry is either temporarily or permanently disabled, mentally compromised, or unable to function normally. (McCreight 2015, 111-112) Neuroweapons include any kind of neurotechnological agent, drug, or device designed to either enhance or deter the cognitive performance of warfighters and target intelligence and command structures as both non-kinetic [non-lethal] and kinetic [lethal, violent] weapons. (Nørgaard & Linden-Vørnle 2021) The Department of Defense defines a “battlespace” as “… the environment, factors, and conditions which must be understood to successfully apply combat power, protect the force, or complete the mission. This includes the air, land, sea, space, and the included enemy and friendly forces, facilities, weather, terrain, the electromagnetic spectrum, and information environment within the operational areas and areas of interest.

(McCreight 2015, 116-117) The secrecy involved in the development of neuroweapons technology remains a big hurdle for those trying to understand this technology, as noted by the academic researcher in this area Armin Krishnan, who has no etic knowledge in the DOD or IC, in his book based on open-source material on Neuroweapons: A researcher of neuroweapons not only has to deal with the issue that official information is unavailable, but furthermore with the problem of outright disinformation. Steve Aftergood has pointed out that Cold War secrecy systems such as Special Access Programs (SAPs) “authorizes defense contractors to employ cover stories to disguise their activities. The only condition is that cover stories must be believable.” (Krishnan 2017, 116) Even in such open societies as the United States and Great Britain, which have developed Neuroweapons since at least the end of World War II, little information is publicly available. The Nazis are credited with developing their own Neuroweapons during the 1930s and World War II. The Wehrmacht, through its Naval Intelligence program, developed a proto-Remote Viewing program and the Nazi SS research institute, Ahnenerbe, is credited with developing Neuroweapons (Kernbach 2013, 6), which was subsequently taken to the United States, Great Britain and back to the Soviet Union. The Soviets fell behind the west in terms of Neuroweapons development after 1937 when Stalin banned such research, at least in terms of public research. This was also during the Stalinist purges of the Soviet Military just before the war, which itself may have been a Nazi Information Operation. The United States CIA developed neuroweapons under the code name ‘MK-Ultra’ during the 1950s through the importation of Nazi scientists under “Project Paperclip.” MK-Ultra was a follow-on to an earlier project known as ‘Project Artichoke’ which used drugs to induce confessions during interrogation, based in Germany after the war and using German scientists. In these interrogations they used LSD and mescaline to induce confessions. Other countries involved in early ‘remote influencing’ technology such as Neuroweapons were Italy through Cazzamali in 1925 and Spain through Robles in 1931. One will notice that all these countries eventually embraced totalitarian regimes. Neuroweapons seems perfectly aligned with totalitarian understandings as noted by Krishnan: • Neurowarfare is likely to extend over many decades with the distinction between peace and war becoming not just blurred, but meaningless. • Neurowarfare primarily targets an adversary’s minds and ultimately seeks to fundamentally alter the adversary’s consciousness until the adversary perceives the world the same way as the sponsors of neurowarfare—the aim is to cognitively assimilate other societies. • Hostilities are carried out", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634244916_cleaned.txt:50:5b27f0fcad8a", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 2403, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634244916_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634244916", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634244916_cleaned", "chunk_index": 51, "text": "countries eventually embraced totalitarian regimes.

IW is applied to both individuals and collectively. So it is not surprising that the East German ‘Stasi’ developed a plan, which may have been taken from the US COINTELPRO campaign against anti-war activists in the 1960s and 70s, which was based on British tactics to combat anti-colonial movements, when they developed the individually targeted Zertsetzung program: [Zertsetzung is] an operational method of the Ministry for Security of State for the effective fight against subversive activities. With Zersetzung, across different operational political activities, one gains influence over hostile and negative persons, in particular over that which is hostile and negative in the dispositions and beliefs, in such a way that there would be shaken off and changed little by little, and, if applicable, the contradictions and differences between the hostile and negative forces would be provoked, exploited, and reinforced. The goal of Zersetzung is the fragmentation, paralysis, disorganization, and isolation of hostile and negative forces, in order to impede thereby, in a preventive manner, the hostile and negative doings, to limit them in large part, or to totally avert them, and if applicable to prepare grounds for a political and ideological reestablishment. (Suckut, 2001, 464) Neuroweapons against individuals is a methodology employed for neutralizing covertly and usually non-lethally any dissident voices as a form of non-obvious warfare (Krishnan 2017, 184). Its use against individuals that pose no violent threat may seem surprising, but it is noted by Krishnan that this was used against peace activists in the 1980s in Great Britain by the British Intelligence services (Krishnan 2017, 120), which practiced their craft in Northern Ireland such as Operation Clockwork Orange. As one researcher has noted: According to statements made by captured and deserting Iraqi soldiers, however, the most devastating and demoralizing programming was the first known military", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634244916_cleaned.txt:51:c0d7f7871591", "wtk_id": NaN}]
