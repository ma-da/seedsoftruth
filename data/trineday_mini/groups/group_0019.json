Whether this is true or not, the fact is that many in this world tend to see things in polarized terms of black and white, good and bad. It makes it easier for them to maneuver through an already very complex and sometimes overwhelming life. Generally these people tend to be afraid of their own shadow. They do their best to welcome the light and to destroy, banish, or suppress that which is considered bad or not light, i.e. what many call the shadow, both within and outside of themselves. Yet I think most reading this would agree that this is an overly simplistic view. On the deepest or most expanded levels, I suspect all beings are somehow interconnected, no matter how polarized they may be. **We all come from the same original source. And to try to banish or destroy something to which you are always connected is on some level an attempt to banish or destroy a part of oneself. ** I love [Solzhenitsyn's quote](https://medium.com/@pourbrew/who-is-willing-to-destroy-a-piece-of-his-own-heart-4b7491666b00) along these lines: \"*If only there were evil people somewhere insidiously committing evil deeds, * *and it were necessary only to separate them from the rest of us and destroy them. * *But the line dividing good and evil cuts through the heart of every human being. * *And who is willing to destroy a piece of his own heart?*\" This quote, by the way, is included in a great lesson titled \"[Beyond Duality](https://www.transformationteam.net/ttcourse/trfc20a)\" from our powerful [Transformation Course](https://www.transformationteam.net/). I highly recommend this free online course (see [rave reviews here](https://www.transformationteam.net/appreciations)). So what I'm finding is that the desire to see things in terms of duality and the accompanying desire to destroy or suppress the shadow are at the root of a lot of unconscious behavior we see manifesting in our world. This may even be at the root of all suffering. If we consider that there was not just one original split in consciousness, other possibilities unfold. We shift from a polarized worldview to a focus more on the interconnectedness of all beings. **If we recognize and honor the full rainbow spectrum of existence and do our best to [see the core divine essence in all](https://www.weboflove.org/wingmakers#seeing), it seems only natural to me that suffering would dramatically decrease and love and joy would increase. **What say you? No matter how consciousness came to be, the fact is that there are gazillions of consciousnesses which now exist in the universe - from amoebas to human beings to beings in other galaxies and dimensions.

Humanity and the vast numbers of groups humans form on this world are but one small example. Ants and mosquitoes are another. I sense that each of these groups, whether human, animal, or otherwise, have their own collective consciousness. Yet they also have their own level of collective unconsciousness or shadow. The shadow aspect is the collective of all parts which the group on some level denies or suppresses. **This collective shadow likely has some sort of mind of its own and causes all sorts of problems, or - looked at in another way - creates all sorts of opportunities for growth.** I have found that when I consciously choose to [shine light](https://www.WantToKnow.info/coreissue) on the unconscious or shadow material, my life and the world around me is enlightened. When we both individually and collectively choose to open to our shadows and even learn to dance with them, life can become much more rich and meaningful. And by embracing the light, the shadow, and all aspects of existence, we more easily recognize love as the transformative force which interconnects us all. I have no doubt that sacred love is the ultimate force of harmonious integration. So the divine source consciousness may have have exploded all at once, or it may have split itself into myriad fragments in a more gradual process, and that process is likely ongoing in some way that I am not clear. This grand process of separation is not a bad thing. There is a time for both separation and integration. A wife subject to continual physical abuse from her husband would likely do best to separate from him. I suspect that even now divine consciousness continues to divide and separate itself in order to explore ever more deeply into the divine mystery of life and existence. Yet at the same time, consciousness appears to be in a process of integration. **Many of us are in various stages of re-membering the deeper interconnectedness of us all. **Some believe that this integration will eventually lead us back into union as one united being. I hear many people these days saying \"we are all one.\" Yet if we were all eventually to give up our individuality and integrate (or disintegrate) back into one unitary being, what would be the purpose of it all? Just to start the whole process all over again? That seems rather pointless to me. Clearly there is some sort of reintegration process happening, and I very much support and am a part of this.

Yet I would hope that even as we integrate, each fragment continues to maintain the unique perspective and wisdom it has gained, which can be shared with the collective of all beings. So rather than saying we are all one, I prefer to say that we are all interconnected in a beautiful, divine dance with the cosmos. **Each of us is a unique and invaluable part of a greater divine whole. And even as we reintegrate the shadow, the light, and the multitudinous aspects of consciousness into a more aware collective consciousness, we can also retain the beautiful individuality that each of us embodies.** Though I highly suspect there is some kind of unitary collective consciousness that both connects and lies within all of us, I know also that my individuated consciousness which is typing these words here is not that unitary consciousness. I and all beings may have access to that collective intelligence, but I am not the One. And I suspect you aren't either. So I don't want you to bow down to me, and I won't bow down to you either. Yet I will most certainly love and honor you as the divine manifestation that you are. My heart's desire is to learn to better dance with you and with all beings. So I'm finding that though I understand people's intention in saying \"we are all one\" as a means of honoring the existence of a unitary collective consciousness that lies within every being, in practical life, you and I are not one. You are there, and I am here. This is what gives life it's richness. If we all were truly one, you and I wouldn't exist as separate beings, and I do suspect that might be boring.

And as much as the world needs your cargo, you need to give it away. Everything depends on this. But the world forgets its needs, and you forget your mission, and the ancestral maps used to guide you have become faded scrawls on the parchment of dead Pharaohs. The cargo weighs you heavy the longer it is held and spoilage becomes a risk. The ship sputters from port to port and at each you ask: \"Is this the way?\" But the way cannot be found without knowing the cargo, and the cargo cannot be known without recognizing there is a way, and it is simply this: **You have gifts. The world needs your gifts.

The purpose of such control is not specified, but it would permit the CIA to engage in nearly undetectable assassinations.** The CIA's Mobile Devices Branch (MDB) developed numerous attacks to remotely hack and control popular smart phones. Infected phones can be instructed to send the CIA the user's geolocation, audio and text communications as well as covertly activate the phone's camera and microphone. These techniques permit the CIA to bypass the encryption of WhatsApp, Signal, Telegram, Wiebo, Confide and Cloackman by hacking the \"smart\" phones that they run on and collecting audio and message traffic before encryption is applied.

The War on Drugs is a racket designed in part to increase the price of drugs so intelligence agencies can fund black budget projects. The illicit drug trade fueled by the US government will likely create serious blowback in the coming years as the deadly drug addiction epidemic marches on, impacting millions of lives across the country. When Nixon first declared war on drugs in 1971, there were fewer than 500,000 hard-core addicts in the nation, most of whom were addicted to heroin. Three decades later, despite the expenditure of $1 trillion in tax dollars, the number of hard-core addicts is shortly expected to exceed five million. The CIA and the Department of State were protecting more and more politically powerful drug traffickers around the world: the Mujihadeen in Afghanistan, the Bolivian cocaine cartels, the top levels of Mexican government, Nicaraguan Contras, Colombian drug dealers and politicians, and others. Media's duties, as I experienced firsthand, were twofold: first, to keep quiet about the gush of drugs that was allowed to flow unimpeded into the US; second, to divert the public's attention by shilling them into believing the drug war was legitimate by falsely presenting the few trickles we were permitted to indict as though they were major \"victories,\" when in fact we were doing nothing more than getting rid of the inefficient competitors of CIA assets. - 25-year veteran of the DEA [Michael Levine](https://www.wanttoknow.info/massmedia#levine) In light of the current Ukraine-Russia war, the agency's latest covert action involves [supporting Neo-Nazis in Ukraine](https://www.wanttoknow.info/a-how-us-uk-government-propaganda-specialists-collaborated-with-nazis-ukraine) since at least 2014, the year of the far-right coup that overthrew pro-Russian president Viktor Yanukovych and incorporated the [Nazi group Azov Battalion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Azov_Brigade) into the country's National Guard.

The lle was no sooner disclosed than a world predisposed to suspicion of the CIA and unaware of what really had happened ... 5 years earller began to repeat questions that have dogged the Agency and the U.S. Government for years. **Was this secret body, which was known to have overthrown governments and installed others, raised armies, staged an invasion of Cuba, spied and counterspied, established airlines, radio stations and schools and supported books, magazines and businesses, running out of the control of its supposed political master? Was it in fact damaging, while it sought to advance, the national interest?** Could it spend huge sums for ransoms, bribes and subversion without check or regard for the consequences? Did it lie to or influence the political leaders of the United States to such an extent that it really was an \"invisible government\" more powerful than even the President? These are questions constantly asked around the world. \"The Invisible Government\" was the phrase applied to American intelllgence agencies, and particularly the CIA, in a book of that title by David Wise and Thomas B. Ross. It was a bestseller in the United States and among many government officials abroad. Former President Truman, whose administration established the CIA in 1947, said In 1963 that by then he saw \"something about the way the CIA has been functioning that is casting a shadow over our historic positions, and I feel that we need to correct it.' And **President Kennedy, as the enormity of the Bay of Pigs disaster came home to him, said to one of the highest officials of his administration that he wanted \"to splinter the CIA in a thousand pieces and scatter it to the winds.**' **In the 19 years that the CIA has been in existence, 150 resolutions for tighter congressional control have been introduced - and put aside**. The statistic in itself is evidence of widespread uneasiness about the CIA and of how little is known about the Agency. For the truth is that despite the CIA's international reputation, few persons in or out of the American Government know much about its work, its organization, its supervision or its relationship to the other arms of the executive branch. A former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, for instance, had no idea how big the CIA budget was. A Senator experienced in foreign affairs proved in an interview to know very little about, but to fear very much, its operations. **In 1960, CIA agents in Laos, disguised as \"military advisers,\" stuffed ballot boxes", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:ia__cia-new-york-times.txt:0:40c69816ef42", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 11433, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "ia__cia-new-york-times.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "ia__cia-new-york-times", "chunk_index": 1, "text": "out of the American Government know much about its work, its organization, its supervision or its relationship to the other arms of the executive branch.

Phoumi Nosavan, set up a \"pro-American\" government** that was desired by President Eisenhower and Secretary of State John Foster Dulles. This operation succeeded--so much so that it stimulated Soviet intervention on the side of leftists Laotians, who counterattacked the Phoumi government. When the Kennedy administration set out to reverse the policy of the Eisenhower administration, it found the CIA deeply committed to Phouml Nosovan and needed 2 years of negotiations and threats to restore the neutralist regime of Prince Souvanna Phouma. **It was the CIA that built up Ngo Dinh Diem as the pro-American head of South Vietnam after the French, through Emperor Baa Dai, had found him in a monastery cell in Belgium and brought him back to Saigon as Premier.** And it was the CIA that helped persuade the Eisenhower and Kennedy administrations to ride out the Vietnamese storm with Diem--probably too long. These recorded incidents not only have prompted much soul searching about the influence of an instrument such as the CIA on American policies but also have given the CIA a reputation for deeds and misdeeds far beyond its real intentions and capacities. **When an embassy subordinate in Lagos, Nigeria, known to be the CIA station chief had a fancier house than the U.S. ambassador, Nigerians made the obvious deduction about who was in charge. ** But as in the case of its overseas reputation, its actual activities in the United States--for instance, its aid in financing a center for international studies at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology--have made the fear of infiltration real to many scholars and businesses.** The revelation that CIA agents served among Michigan State University scholars in South Vietnam from 1955 to 1959 has contributed to the fear. **The nature of the agents' work and the cIrcumstances of their employment are in dispute, but their very involvement, even relatively long ago, has aroused concern that hundreds of scholarly and charitable American efforts abroad will be tainted and hampered by the suspicions of other governments.

At 4:45 am, the heavily armed police stormed the apartment, killing Panther member Mark Clark immediately, who was serving a security duty. Clark fired his shotgun, the only shot fired by the Panthers that day, while the police and FBI would end up shooting 98 times.270 Forensics and firearms experts determined that Clark's shot was fired from very near the floor, indicating that Clark had already sustained grave injuries. The raid team would then assault the room of Fred Hampton, a rising leader in the Panther movement. Police would fire twice at Hampton, who was lying next to his pregnant girlfriend, hitting his shoulder. Court transcripts revealed the following conversation took place:271 \"That's Fred Hampton.\" \"Is he dead?... Bring him out.\" \"He's barely alive. \"He'll make it. Two more shots were fired, point blank at Hampton's head. \"He's good and dead now.\" Crime Scene from Fred Hampton's Bedroom Over a dozen more Panthers residing in the apartment would be wounded, beaten, and then charged with attempted murder of police officers. The next day, the media largely defended the FBI's actions. The *Chicago Tribune *published photos showing holes purported to be from bullets fired by the Panthers, but forensics would later reveal these holes to have been made by nails.272 Documents released by the Freedom of Information Act include a sketch of Hampton's apartment drawn by an FBI informant, used by police and FBI in the assassination. The informant received $300 from the FBI for providing the information.273 **The FBI had tried other methods before resorting to assassination, including sending a bogus letter to a rival Chicago gang leader in hopes of provoking a violent retaliation** which read: \"Brother Jeff: I've spent some time with some Panther friends on the west side lately and I know whats been going on.

Signed, A Black Brother You Don't Know.\"274 The use of bogus letters for sabotage and attempting to provoke violence was widely used by the FBI throughout COINTELPRO. **Why was Fred Hampton targeted? He was a rising leader in the Black Panther Party and was in the process of uniting various gangs, including the Puerto Rican 'Young Lords' and the Caucasian 'Young Patriots' into a political coalition. He had the potential to drastically change the political landscape of Chicago by channeling the youth unrest that had previously been directed against other gangs and instead direct it at the political establishment to fight against police corruption and to generate socially constructive energies.** **This type of action was directly antagonistic to one of the primary directives of COINTELPRO put forth by J. Edgar Hoover himself, which read:275** **\"1. Prevent the coalition of militant black nationalist groups.\"** The same document also contained another relevant directive:276 \"Prevent the rise of a 'messiah'\" Fred Hampton had the charisma to unite large groups of young men and the attitude of social welfare and community development that had the potential to gain the support of the broader progressive community.

By the late '60s, the Black Panther Party was the most prominent African American political force in the United States. They advocated a 10 point socialist program for black self-determination, provided free food and healthcare to communities, fought against hard drugs, and formed legal armed street patrols to deter violence from the KKK and other antagonistic organizations.

They also advocated for community control of police, schools and other institutions. Today, these points are largely ignored in favor of the racist caricature promoted by the Bureau. The operations the FBI took to subvert the Panthers is truly astounding. **For example, there is the Black Panther coloring book, created by the FBI and distributed by Bureau informants to black children in an attempt to marginalize the Party within the black community.277 It is directly related to Hoover's directive:** **\"4. Prevent militant black nationalist groups and leaders from gaining respectability\"** The goal was not to influence the children of these communities, but to marginalize the Panthers within the white community. The coloring book aimed to do just that, and would certainly be shocking to anyone who saw it. Once marginalized, the public would support increasingly repressive policies against the Panthers and their leadership, such as the Fred Hampton assassination. To J. Edgar Hoover and the FBI, it did not matter what the activities of the Black Panther Party consisted of. **In 1969, an FBI special agent sent Hoover a memo detailing how his investigation of the Panthers had only turned up pacifist activities such as feeding breakfast to children.278 Hoover shot back a memo saying that the agent's career ambitions were directly related to supplying Hoover with information supporting his view that the Panthers were \"... a violence prone organization seeking to overthrow the government by revolutionary means.\"279** **To prevent the unification of the Black Panther Party and the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee, popularly known as SNCC, the FBI resorted to fostering splits between the leadership of the two organizations. The FBI targeted Stokely Carmichael by using a technique known as 'bad jacket': they forged documents indicating that Carmichael was a CIA informant.280 It worked.** The FBI also had the policy of arresting Panther members for any reason, even just on suspicion of crime without evidence, for the purpose of exhausting the Party's funds to pay bonds. The Panther's attorney said in 1970: \"In a period of two years - December, 1967 to December, 1969 - the Black Panther Party has expended in bail-bond premiums alone - just the premiums, that is, money that will never be returned - a sum in excess of $200,000! How many breakfasts or lunches for hungry children, how much medical attention sorely needed in the ghetto communities would that $200,000 have furnished? In the same two-year period, twenty-eight Panthers were killed.\"281 In instances where dozens of Panthers were arrested, the bond requirements were too high to pay and members sat in jail for weeks, or", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:ia__cointelpro-fbi.txt:3:b948786e6738", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 11439, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "ia__cointelpro-fbi.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "ia__cointelpro-fbi", "chunk_index": 4, "text": "expended in bail-bond premiums alone - just the premiums, that is, money that will never be returned - a sum in excess of $200,000!

It was founded by Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. and several other southern black ministers. By 1964, Dr. King had given his 'I have a dream speech' and had emerged as a preeminent civil rights leader and had also began to address social change that transcended racial issues. At this point, the FBI had marked King as a clear threat to the 'established order'. **Agent William C. Sullivan committed to writing:** **\"We must mark [King] now, if we have not before, as the most dangerous Negro in the future of this Nation from the standpoint of communism, the Negro, and national security... it maybe unrealistic to limit [our actions against King] to legalistic proofs that would stand up in court or before Congressional Committees.\"283** **When it was announced that King would win the Nobel Prize, the FBI compiled an audio tape consisting of various fragments of conversations from King's tapped phones, bugged offices and hotel rooms. It was purported to demonstrate that King was a sexual deviant.** It was sent to King with an anonymous note stating that it would be released to the press unless he committed suicide prior to receiving the award.284 When King failed to reply, FBI Associate Director Cartha DeLoach offered the contents of the tape to various news institutions, including *Newsweek, *but the reporters nearly universally declined to report on the story.

As the movement rose to prominence, the FBI marked them as an 'extremist organization' to target.287 One document released under the Freedom of Information Act advocates that: \"local police put [AIM] leaders under close scrutiny, and arrest them on every possible charge until they could no longer make bail.\"288** During a presentation by members of the Congressional Black Caucus to the UN Human Rights Commissioner, it was alleged that virtually every known leader of AIM had been imprisoned in state or federal prisons, some repeatedly. Russell Means, for example, was charged with 37 counts but not one held up in court.289 It was later revealed that the FBI had infiltrated Mean's defense team but was still unable to pin their charges against him. In 1973, thousands of Native Americans from reservations across the West had gathered at Wounded Knee at the Pine Ridge reservation to simultaneously commemorate the 1890 massacre and protest the political corruption of tribal president Dick Wilson, who had received $62,000 from the Bureau of Indian Affairs and was using it to fund a private force that suppressed opposition and often resorted to murder.290 The force designated themselves \"Guardians of the Oglala Nation\", abbreviated as GOONS.

Attempts to impeach Wilson, who was responsible for years of political violence, had failed. The FBI considered the occupation an act of treason and began a siege of AIM members, in coordination with US Marshalls, agents from the BIA and the GOONS of Dick Wilson. Wilson bluntly declared in a speech that \"AIM will die at Wounded Knee\".291 According to Historian Rex Weyler, who obtained documents subpoenaed from the Pentagon, the U.S. Marshall Service: \"...directed the employment of 17 APCs [armored personnel carriers], 130,000 rounds of M-16 ammunition, 41,000 rounds of M-40 high explosive, as well as helicopters, Phantom jets, and personnel. Military officers, supply sergeants, maintenance technicians, chemical officers, and medical teams remained on duty throughout the 71 day siege, all working in civilian clothes [to conceal their unconstitutional involvement in this 'civil disorder']\"292 All of this was on site at Pine Ridge during the 71 day standoff, during which AIM demanded the removal of Wilson from office, the GOONs disbanded, and the military presence removed. By the end, hundreds of thousands of rounds were fired at AIM positions, two AIM members were killed, 14 seriously injured, and eight 'disappeared'. In the 36 months that proceeded the end of the Pine Ridge standoff, more than 60 AIM members died violently on or near Pine Ridge.293 The Civil Rights Commission revealed that AIM was right to feel aggrieved during the occupation of Pine Ridge: The FBI had been complicit in rigging the 1974 Pine Ridge elections against AIM members.294 286 Ward Churchill, \"Agents of Repression.\" [Excerpt available here](http://books.google.com.pe/books?id=uP8YRoyyNVwC&pg=PA177&lpg=PA177&dq=They%2B%5Bthe%2BIndians%5D%2Bare%2Ba%2Bconquered%2Bnation%2C%2Band%2Bwhen%2Byou%2Bare%2Bconquered%2C%2Bthe%2Bpeople%2Byou%2Bare%2Bconquered%2Bby%2Bdictate%2Byour%2Bfuture.%2BThis%2Bis%2Ba%2Bbasic%2Bphilosophy%2Bof%2Bmine.%2BIf%2BI%27m%2Bpart%2Bof%2Ba%2Bconquered%2Bnation%2C%2BI%27ve%2Bgot%2Bto%2Byield%2Bto%2Bauthority...%2B%5BThe%2BFBI%2Bmust%2Bfunction%2Bas%5D%2Ba%2Bcolonial%2Bpolice%2Bforce.%E2%80%9D%2B-%2BAssistent%2BSpecial%2BAgent%2Bin%2BCharge%2BNorman%2BZigrossi&source=bl&ots=7_6wkrfkqK&sig=skuoZ8z2cy1hzjv9ptRnRrb-1L8&hl=en&sa=X&ei=WbgVU9WeNMP7kQfJtIG4DQ&ved=0CCcQ6AEwAA%23v%3Donepage&q=They%20%5Bthe%20Indians%5D%20are%20a%20conquered%20nation%2C%20and%20when%20you%20are%20conquered%2C%20the%20people%20you%20are%20conquered%20by%20dictate%20your%20future.%20This%20is%20a%20basic%20philosophy%20of%20mine.%20If%20I%27m%20part%20of%20a%20conquered%20nation%2C%20I%27ve%20got%20to%20yield%20to%20authority...%20%5BThe%20FBI%20must%20function%20as%5D%20a%20colonial%20police%20force.%E2%80%9D%20-%20Assistent%20Special%20Agent%20in%20Charge%20Norman%20Zigrossi&f=false). 287 Documents [available here.](http://www.whale.to/b/cointelpro_7.html) 288 \"The COINTEPRO Papers,\" page 280 289 *The Guardian, *\"[Russell Means obituary](http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/nov/01/russell-means),\" November 1, 2012 290 A Presentation to the United Nations Human Rights Committee by members of the Congressional Black Caucus, [available here](http://www.whale.to/b/wolf_coin.html#American_Indian_Movement_). 291 Ward Churchill, \"Agents of Repression,\" Excerpt [available here](http://books.google.com.pe/books?id=uP8YRoyyNVwC&pg=PA146&lpg=PA146&dq=%22aim%2Bwill%2Bdie%2Bat%2Bwounded%2Bknee%22%2Bdick%2Bwilson&source=bl&ots=7_4wgtkkpF&sig=3fx-Ho6z04aNFr7mswhw8IJXsr4&hl=en&sa=X&ei=c9LeUb_EBOSTyQGM_YGgBw&redir_esc=y%23v%3Donepage&q=%22aim%20will%20die%20at%20wounded%20knee%22%20dick%20wilson&f=false). 292 Weyler, Rex \"Blood on the Land,\" page 54 293 \"COINTELPRO Papers,\" Page 270 294 Ibid. * * * * Conclusion The Church Committee investigated COINTELPRO and concluded: **\"Too many people have been spied upon by too many Government agencies and too much information has been collected.

The Constitutional system of checks and balances has not adequately controlled intelligence activities. Until recently the Executive branch has neither delineated the scope of permissible activities nor established procedures for supervising intelligence agencies. Congress has failed to exercise sufficient oversight, seldom questioning the use to which its appropriations were being put.\" Simply put, the committee's conclusions are correct but fall short. It is clear that for a period of nearly three decades, the FBI waged a literal domestic war on largely peaceful activists who sought to bring about social and political change. During the time of the Vietnam war, [MK-ULTRA](https://www.WantToKnow.info/050626mkultra), the struggles of various civil rights movements, Watergate and other criminal acts in the executive branch, the United States needed effective leaders and organizations to affect change, yet the FBI successfully suppressed any serious movements that arose. * * * * Food for Thought: 1.

How likely is it that other high profile assassinations similar to Fred Hampton, such as Martin Luther King Jr., were undertaken by the FBI under COINTELPRO orders? 3.

That report prompted investigations by both Congress (in the form of the [Church Committee](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Church_committee)) and a presidential commission (known as the [Rockefeller Commission](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_President%27s_Commission_on_CIA_activities_within_the_United_States)) into the domestic activities of the CIA, the FBI, and intelligence-related agencies of the military. **Congressional hearings and the Rockefeller Commission report revealed to the public for the first time that the CIA and the DOD had conducted experiments on both cognizant and unwitting human subjects as part of an extensive program to influence and control human behavior through the use of psychoactive drugs (such as LSD and mescaline) and other chemical, biological, and psychological means. **They also revealed that at least one subject had died after administration of LSD.

Eventually, Klein says he decided to take his documents to the Los Angeles Times, to blow the whistle on what he calls \"an illegal and Orwellian project.\" But after working for two months with LA Times reporter Joe Menn, Klein says he was told the story had been killed at the request of then-Director of National Intelligence John Negroponte and then-director of the NSA Gen.

It sounds like science fiction, but it's true. Two of the chief protagonists - Britain and America - officially deny its existence. But the BBC has confirmation from the Australian Government that such a network really does exist. The base is linked directly to the headquarters of the US National Security Agency (NSA) at Fort Mead in Maryland, and it is also linked to a series of other listening posts scattered across the world, like Britain's own GCHQ. The power of the network, codenamed Echelon, is astounding. **Every international telephone call, fax, e-mail, or radio transmission can be listened to by powerful computers capable of voice recognition. They home in on a long list of key words, or patterns of messages.** **The network is so secret that the British and American Governments refuse to admit that Echelon even exists. But another ally, Australia, has decided not to be so coy.** The man who oversees Australia's security services, Inspector General of Intelligence and Security Bill Blick, has confirmed to the BBC that their Defence Signals Directorate (DSD) does form part of the network.

He ... spent his later years caring for dying patients ... and fighting lawsuits from survivors of his secret tests. He will always be remembered as the Government chemist who dosed Americans with psychedelics in the name of national security. Mr. Gottlieb joined the C.I.A. in 1951. Two years later, the agency established MKUltra and Mr. Gottlieb was running it. He served two decades as the senior scientist presiding over some of the C.I.A.'s darkest secrets. The first of these were the LSD experiments. Mr. Gottlieb was fascinated by the drug [and] took it hundreds of times. In the 1950's and early 1960's, the agency gave mind-altering drugs to hundreds of unsuspecting Americans in an effort to explore the possibilities of controlling human consciousness. In one case, a mental patient in Kentucky was dosed with LSD continuously for 174 days. Other experiments involved agency employees, military officers and college students.** In all, the agency conducted 149 separate mind-control experiments, and as many as 25 involved unwitting subjects. At least one participant died, others went mad, and still others suffered psychological damage after participating in the project, known as [MK Ultra](https://www.WantToKnow.info/050626mkultra). The C.I.A. ... deliberately destroyed most of the MKUltra records in 1973.** Mr. Gottlieb was also involved in the C.I.A.'s assassination plots. [He] developed a poison handkerchief to kill an Iraqi colonel, an array of toxic gifts to be delivered to Fidel Castro, and a poison dart to kill a leftist leader in the Congo. **INTELLIGENCE: Of Dart Guns and Poisons** **1975-09-09, *Time* Magazine** [http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,913459,00.html](http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,913459,00.html) For nearly nine months the congressional investigations of the Central Intelligence Agency have been conducted behind closed doors.

But if such internal investigations are time-tested, their outcomes are also predictable:** from 1993 to early 2011, F.B.I. agents fatally shot about 70 \"subjects\" and wounded about 80 others - and every one of those episodes was deemed justified, according to interviews and internal F.B.I. records.** The last two years have followed the same pattern: an F.B.I. spokesman said that since 2011, there had been no findings of improper intentional shootings.** In most of the shootings, the F.B.I.'s internal investigation was the only official inquiry. **In the Orlando case, for example, there have been conflicting accounts about basic facts like whether the Chechen man, Ibragim Todashev, attacked an agent with a knife, was unarmed or was brandishing a metal pole. But Orlando homicide detectives are not independently investigating what happened. Occasionally, the F.B.I. does discipline an agent. A typical punishment involved adding letters of censure to agents' files. Critics say the fact that for at least two decades no agent has been disciplined for any instance of deliberately shooting someone raises questions about the credibility of the bureau's internal investigations. **The 9/11 Hijackers: Fraud in Official Video Exhibits Uncovered by Expert Panel** **2012-09-10, MarketWatch/*Wall Street Journal*** [http://www.marketwatch.com/story/the-911-hijackers-fraud-in-official-video-ex...](http://www.marketwatch.com/story/the-911-hijackers-fraud-in-official-video-exhibits-uncovered-by-expert-panel-2012-09-10) A Panel of 22 researchers into the history of 9/11 has uncovered evidence of fraud in the photographic images of Muslim hijackers prior to boarding the planes on 9/11.

He was intentionally letting guns go to Mexico. An Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms [ATF] senior agent assigned to the Phoenix office in 2010, **Dodson's job is to stop gun trafficking across the border. Instead, he says he was ordered to sit by and watch it happen.** Investigators call the tactic letting guns \"walk.\" In this case, walking into the hands of criminals who would use them in Mexico and the United States. Dodson's bosses say that never happened. Agent Dodson and other sources say the gun walking strategy was approved all the way up to the Justice Department. The idea was to see where the guns ended up, build a big case and take down a cartel. And it was all kept secret from Mexico. ATF named the case \"Fast and Furious.\" Documents show the inevitable result: The guns that ATF let go began showing up at crime scenes in Mexico. And **as ATF stood by watching thousands of weapons hit the streets. The Fast and Furious group supervisor noted the escalating Mexican violence. One e-mail noted, \"958 killed in March 2010 ... most violent month since 2005.\"** Dodson feels that ATF was partly to blame for the escalating violence. Senior agents including Dodson ... confronted their supervisors over and over. Their answer ... \"If you're going to make an omelette, you've got to break some eggs.\" On Dec. 14, 2010, Border Patrol Agent Brian Terry was gunned down. Two assault rifles ATF had let go nearly a year before were found at Terry's murder. Dodson said, \"I felt guilty. I mean it's crushing.\" Dodson said they never did take down a drug cartel. However, he said thousands of Fast and Furious weapons are still out there and will be claiming victims on both sides of the border for years to come. **Note:** Could it be that there are those", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:ia__intelligence-agency-corruption.txt:9:d5b22da9b383", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 11454, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "ia__intelligence-agency-corruption.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "ia__intelligence-agency-corruption", "chunk_index": 10, "text": "2010, Border Patrol Agent Brian Terry was gunned down.

Kennedy in Dallas, Tex., November 22, 1963. Scientific acoustical evidence establishes a high probability that two gunmen fired at President John F. Kennedy. Other scientific evidence does not preclude the possibility of two gunmen firing at the President.** The committee believes, on the basis of the evidence available to it, that President John F. Kennedy was probably assassinated as a result of a conspiracy. **The committee is unable to identify the other gunman or the extent of the conspiracy. The [original] investigation into the possibility of conspiracy in the assassination was inadequate. The conclusions of the investigations were arrived at in good faith, but presented in a fashion that was too definitive. The Department of Justice failed to exercise initiative in supervising and directing the investigation by the Federal Bureau of Investigation of the assassination. **The Federal Bureau of Investigation failed to investigate adequately the possibility of a conspiracy to assassinate the President. The Central Intelligence Agency was deficient in its collection and sharing of information** both prior to and subsequent to the assassination. The Warren Commission failed to investigate adequately the possibility of a conspiracy to assassinate the President. **Note:** This same [US Congressional report](http://www.archives.gov/research/jfk/select-committee-report/summary.html#king), on the subject of the Martin Luther King, Jr. assassination, states that \"The committee believes, on the basis of the circumstantial evidence available to it, that there is a likelihood that James Earl Ray assassinated Dr. Martin Luther King as [a result of a conspiracy](https://www.personalgrowthcourses.net/video/martin_luther_king_jr_mlk_assassination_video).\" Why hasn't this information been widely reported and become public knowledge?

It reveals that the operatives and four unidentified associates were at the Ambassador Hotel, Los Angeles in the moments before and after the shooting on 5 June, 1968. The CIA had no domestic jurisdiction and some of the officers were based in South-East Asia at the time, with no reason to be in Los Angeles. Kennedy had just won the California Democratic primary on an anti-War ticket and was set to challenge Nixon for the White House. A 24-year-old Palestinian, Sirhan Sirhan, was arrested as the lone assassin. However, even under hypnosis, he has never been able to remember the shooting and defence psychiatrists concluded he was in a trance at the time. Witnesses placed Sirhan's gun several feet in front of Kennedy but the autopsy showed the fatal shot came from one inch behind. **Dr Herbert Spiegel, a world authority on hypnosis at Columbia University, believes Sirhan may have been hypnotically programmed to act as a decoy for the real assassin. **Three of these men have been positively identified as senior officers who worked together in 1963 at JMWAVE, the CIA's Miami base. David Morales was Chief of Operations and once told friends: \"I was in Dallas when we got the son of a bitch and I was in Los Angeles when we got the little bastard.\" George Joannides was Chief of [Psychological Warfare Operations](https://www.WantToKnow.info/060123psyops).

Witnesses withheld information to cover right-wing extremists.\"233 Casson points to a 1972 car bombing in Peteano that killed three paramilitary police and was blamed on leftists, after which 200 Communists were immediately arrested. He found that there were no police investigations of the scene, and the official report was a forgery.234 In fact, it was perpetrated by a right-wing terrorist named Vincenzo Vinciguerra,235 operating under Gladio orders, who later confessed to the crime. Vinciguerra's testimony reveals that it was easy to escape and remain hidden because everyone in the Italian security apparatus shared his anti-Communist convictions.236 His testimony further revealed \"a secret organisation, a super-organisation with a network of communications, arms, and explosives, and men trained to use them.\"237 **Years later, in prison, he would claim \"I say that every single outrage that followed from 1969 fitted into a single organised matrix.\"238** Nearly 2,000 people would die from political murder or acts of terrorism over this period of time. **When ex-Prime Minister Andreotti finally testified in 1990, he revealed that arms and equipment were provided by the CIA and placed in 139 underground caches across the country.

During the Cold War, Turkey shared a third of the total borders with the Soviet bloc and maintained the largest standing army in Europe, and the second in NATO after the United States. In 1952, a stay-behind army was organized under the codename 'Counter-Guerrilla'. \"On November 3 (1996), a truck crashed into a Mercedes Benz in Susurluk, ninety miles south of Istanbul, and killed three Turkish passengers: a fugitive heroin smuggler and hitman, a former high-ranking police officer, and a former 'Miss Cinema.' The lone survivor was a right-wing member of parliament. In the car's trunk, police found a forged passport, police identification papers, ammunition, silencers, and machine guns. Abdullah Catli, the fugitive heroin smuggler, had escaped from a Swiss prison. The dead beauty queen, Gonca Uz, was his girlfriend. The police officer was Huseyin Kocadag, head of a Turkish police academy and a former Istanbul deputy police chief who reportedly organized hit squads in the southeast that kill Kurdish guerrillas and their supporters. The survivor, Sedat Bucak, a member of parliament from the conservative True Path Party, is reportedly in charge of 2,000 Kurdish mercenaries paid by the government to fight Kurdish guerrillas. The car crash has created a sensation in Turkey and has led parliament to hold hearings on the ties linking the True Path Party, the police, and thugs like Abdullah Catli.

Even though there was no Soviet occupation, some of the groups did take up arms against left-wing dissidents in their own countries. Some descendants of these groups are still at it, especially in Turkey.** Abdullah Catli was one of those. \"The accident unveiled the dark liaisons within the state,\" former prime minister Bulent Ecevit told parliament in December. Now leader of a small opposition social-democratic party, Ecevit knows a lot about those liaisons. He first told me about them - and the American connection - back in 1990, when I interviewed him in his Ankara office.\" - *The Progressive*240 Bulent Ecevit, five time Turkish prime minister, who is cited in the above quote, declared that the Taksim Square massacre was a Gladio operation, where half a million citizens had rallied. It was organized by trade unions, and the shooting lasted for 20 minutes while a thousand policemen in attendance did not intervene. About 40 people were killed, and though none of the perpetrators were caught, 500 demonstrators were detained. The massacre occurred during a broader wave of political violence.241 The U.S. State Department in its 1995 Human Rights report noted that: \"Prominent credible human rights organizations, Kurdish leaders, and local Kurds asserted that the government acquiesces in, or even carries out, the murder of civilians... Human rights groups reported the widespread and credible belief that a Counter-Guerrilla group associated with the security forces had carried out at least some 'mystery killings'\".242 American journalist Lucy Komisar, when asking U.S. officials about investigating the human rights reports, was told \"That's classified.\" The Turkish military would likewise block all investigations in their country.243 **There is evidence of Gladio operatives extensively operating torture campaigns for political purposes. For example, Talhat Turhan, former Turkey General, survived torture at the hands of special forces. He was told \"...I was now 'in the hands of a Counter Guerrilla unit operating under the high command of the Army outside the constitution and the laws.'

A 1996 *New York Times *article notes that: \"evidence suggests that officially sanctioned criminality may have reached levels that few had imagined... **One of Turkey's most prominent pro-Kurdish politicians, Guven Ozata, said the car crash and its aftermath had convinced him that state-sponsored death squads were behind many of the estimated 3,500 unsolved killings that have been committed in the southeastern part of the country in the last decade. Most of the victims had been suspected of sympathizing with separatist Kurdish causes.** ''These gangs have a direct link with mystery killings,'' Mr. Ozata said at a news conference. ''This is no longer a hypothesis or a guess. It is a reality acknowledged by government officials.'' **Several politicians and others who are calling for investigations into the government's relationship with criminal gangs believe that the gangs used their official ties as cover for involvement in Turkey's lucrative heroin-smuggling trade. They suspect that senior officials were engaged in the trade or tolerated it as a way of repaying gangs that killed at their behest.\" - *New York Times*246** The evidence of Gladio operations in Turkey reveal another important link: The collusion between paramilitary forces and drug traffickers. At the time (and to this day), Turkey served as a major hub in the smuggling of drugs into Western Europe, from the Southeast Asian 'Golden Triangle' and later the Middle East. **It is likely that drugs served as a significant source of funding for these decentralized operations and was the catalyst for a bond between the state and the criminal underworld that ensured massive corruption in the country that exists to this day. After all, we know that the Gehlen Organization was involved in the black market in the area to raise extra funds for their intelligence operations. It seems that this practice spread throughout the web of 'stay-behind' armies financed and armed by the CIA and NATO.** 240 *The Progressive, *\"[Turkey ́s Terrorists: A CIA Legacy Lives On](http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Turkey%27s%2Bterrorists%3A%2Ba%2BCIA%2Blegacy%2Blives%2Bon.-a019254727),\" April 1, 1997 241 Ganser ́s *Whitehead Journal of Diplomacy and International Relations, *page 73 242 Ganser's *NATO's Secret Army, *page 20 243 Ibid. 244 Ganser ́s *Whitehead Journal of Diplomacy and International Relations, *page 74 245 Ganser's *NATO's Secret Army, *page 240 246 *New York", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:ia__operation-gladio-false-flag.txt:4:233aead324d9", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 11463, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "ia__operation-gladio-false-flag.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "ia__operation-gladio-false-flag", "chunk_index": 5, "text": "their intelligence operations.

Each of the several groups was trained and equipped to act as an autonomous guerrilla unit, capable of mobilizing and carrying on guerrilla warfare with minimal or no outside direction.\"247** These groups were equipped with automatic weapons and small mountain mortars stashed in underground caches throughout the country.248 The group was involved with the 1967 coup, where leftists were widely reported to have large leads in the polls. As NATO orders were to prevent any type of leftist 'insurgency', the group took over the Greece Defense Ministry, rolled into Athens, took control of communications centers, Parliament, the Royal Palace, and arrested over 10,000 people, many of whom were tortured.249 247 Len Scott, \"Intelligence, Crisis and Security.\" [http://books.google.com.pe/books?id=MS_cAAAAQBAJ&pg=PA117&lpg=PA117&dq=%E2%80%9CThe%2BGreek-American%2BCIA%2Bofficer%2Brecruited%2Bseveral%2Bgroups%2Bof%2BGreek%2Bcitizens%2Bfor%2Bwhat%2Bthe%2BCIA%2Bcalled%2B%E2%80%98a%2Bnucleus%2Bfor%2Brallying%2Ba%2Bcitizen%2Barmy%2Bagainst%2Bthe&source=bl&ots=0GpTLFblo7&sig=3Yq62aNUVVeQhMfkdf-s_NwpSbw&hl=es-419&sa=X&ei=m5VYUt-ZBYPQ9ASymIGIBw&ved=0CCoQ6AEwAA%23v%3Donepage&q=%E2%80%9CThe%20Greek-American%20CIA%20officer%20recruited%20several%20groups%20of%20Greek%20citizens%20for%20what%20the%20CIA%20called%20%E2%80%98a%20nucleus%20for%20rallying%20a%20citizen%20army%20against%20the&f=false](http://books.google.com.pe/books?id=MS_cAAAAQBAJ&pg=PA117&lpg=PA117&dq=%E2%80%9CThe%2BGreek-American%2BCIA%2Bofficer%2Brecruited%2Bseveral%2Bgroups%2Bof%2BGreek%2Bcitizens%2Bfor%2Bwhat%2Bthe%2BCIA%2Bcalled%2B%E2%80%98a%2Bnucleus%2Bfor%2Brallying%2Ba%2Bcitizen%2Barmy%2Bagainst%2Bthe&source=bl&ots=0GpTLFblo7&sig=3Yq62aNUVVeQhMfkdf-s_NwpSbw&hl=es-419&sa=X&ei=m5VYUt-ZBYPQ9ASymIGIBw&ved=0CCoQ6AEwAA%23v%3Donepage&q=%E2%80%9CThe%20Greek-American%20CIA%20officer%20recruited%20several%20groups%20of%20Greek%20citizens%20for%20what%20the%20CIA%20called%20%E2%80%98a%20nucleus%20for%20rallying%20a%20citizen%20army%20against%20the&f=false)[Excerpt available here](http://books.google.com.pe/books?id=MS_cAAAAQBAJ&pg=PA117&lpg=PA117&dq=%E2%80%9CThe%2BGreek-American%2BCIA%2Bofficer%2Brecruited%2Bseveral%2Bgroups%2Bof%2BGreek%2Bcitizens%2Bfor%2Bwhat%2Bthe%2BCIA%2Bcalled%2B%E2%80%98a%2Bnucleus%2Bfor%2Brallying%2Ba%2Bcitizen%2Barmy%2Bagainst%2Bthe&source=bl&ots=0GpTLFblo7&sig=3Yq62aNUVVeQhMfkdf-s_NwpSbw&hl=es-419&sa=X&ei=m5VYUt-ZBYPQ9ASymIGIBw&ved=0CCoQ6AEwAA%23v%3Donepage&q=%E2%80%9CThe%20Greek-American%20CIA%20officer%20recruited%20several%20groups%20of%20Greek%20citizens%20for%20what%20the%20CIA%20called%20%E2%80%98a%20nucleus%20for%20rallying%20a%20citizen%20army%20against%20the&f=false). 248 Ganser ́s *Whitehead Journal of Diplomacy and International Relations, *page 77 249 Ibid. * * * * Conclusion **Although the CIA and NATO have steadfastly refused to acknowledge the existence of Gladio, giving them deniability from ever having to disclose documents related to the operation, the existence of these fascist and violent underground networks has been acknowledged by the governments of nearly every NATO country.

If these activities are so illegal, why are people not coming forward to report them? **Over the last fifty years US government intelligence agencies have perfected a complex, sequential system to systematically silence or destroy any employee, including his or her family, who attempts to reveal illegal or unconstitutional activities conducted as part of secret government operations.** As a condition of employment, military and intelligence employees recruited for secret operations are required to sign a \"secrecy agreement,\" or \"nondisclosure agreement,\" before being given access to the position, which offers high pay and status in the organization. This agreement threatens civil and criminal penalties if the employee reveals ANY information regarding the program. Thinking the agreement will only be used for legal purposes and will get them the coveted job, all employees eagerly sign it. This secrecy agreement was originally designed to protect legitimate classified information, to protect military personnel during wartime and protect legitimate national defense information and technology. However,** because of the binding power of the agreement, government agencies began using it as a powerful tool to silence federal employees who question the legality of certain government operations.** It was the perfect tool to threaten, silence or jail any whistle blower who dared to challenge the secret operations of government. Today, the secrecy agreement is routinely used as", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:ia__whistleblowers-silenced-punished.txt:0:36b4550cfbd2", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 11467, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "ia__whistleblowers-silenced-punished.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "ia__whistleblowers-silenced-punished", "chunk_index": 1, "text": "designed to protect legitimate classified information, to protect military personnel during wartime and protect legitimate national defense information and technology. However,** because of the binding power of the agreement, government agencies began using it as a powerful tool to silence federal employees who question the legality of certain government operations.** It was the perfect tool to threaten, silence or jail any whistle blower who dared to challenge the secret operations of government. Today, the secrecy agreement is routinely used as an efficient weapon to intimidate or silence employees. Annual refresher briefings are given to remind employees of the penalties for violating the agreement. These penalties include huge fines, termination, financial ruin and even prison - all of which mean the destruction of their lives and their families. Most will not reveal any wrongdoing, no matter how egregious, for fear of calculated, severe retribution. **When employees sign the secrecy agreement and are cleared for classified programs, they are not told they are giving up their right to a jury trial, or to sue the agency that hired them. If they try to do so as a whistle blower, they find they have no right to be heard in federal court.** Many have found this out when their case was denied; then it was too late. That is part of the system. If the employee attempts to contact their Congressman or Senator, their representative is blocked from receiving any information about their case, because they do not have the necessary \"clearance.\" When the employee attempts to blow the whistle to the Congressional intelligence committees, their response is ignored. It is made clear to committee members that they are not to touch such cases, so they refer them back to their Senator or Congressman, who cannot access information involved in their case. **If a courageous employee continues to proceed and blow the whistle, a system of personal and career destruction follows.** This begins with promotions being denied, being turned down for sensitive or career enhancing assignments, and their files being flagged, ruining their reputation inside their agency. At this point their career is over. If they go quietly, the retribution stops. When the employee still continues their effort to report the information, their travel records, personnel records, medical records and security records are searched for mistakes or damaging information that can be used to threaten them with termination. Their telephones and computers are monitored searching for incriminating information. If no substantive information can be found, it is fabricated and placed in their file. Employees who refuse to back down are then subjected to internal \"security investigations,\" multiple, hostile \"interviews,\" attempting to get them to recant their information, and multiple polygraph interrogations. In many cases, the employee is commanded to report to the internal medical office for psychological evaluation. If they comply, the evaluation labels them as paranoid, unstable, or disgruntled.

In many cases, the employee is commanded to report to the internal medical office for psychological evaluation. If they comply, the evaluation labels them as paranoid, unstable, or disgruntled. This information is placed in their file and is used later to justify the agency's action in the event of outside scrutiny. **If the employee contacts a member of the news media, they are immediately cited with violating their secrecy agreement and criminal penalties are filed against them. Several news media outlets are connected to the CIA and NSA and notify them of the employee's contact.** Finally, the employee is forced to resign after being threatened with termination in kangaroo court meetings where the information fabricated in their files is used against them. After termination or forced resignation, interest rates on their internal credit union loans are raised to make the payments unaffordable. The release of the employee's retirement funds needed provide for their family are blocked (a felony). The agency black lists them from gaining employment with other government agencies or contractors, further ruining them financially. Dehumanized, financially ruined and under severe emotional and mental pressure, the employee's family begins to break apart. If the family's foundation is not strong, this results in alcoholism, depression and divorce. **In some cases, it has resulted in the employee committing suicide, the ultimate goal of the program of destruction. This silences the employee permanently, obscuring the agency's role in their destruction. It is the perfect crime.** Should the employee still have the resolve to endure this program of career and personal destruction and continues to press for release of the information, or if his family members attempt to sue the agency for the illegal activity, classified agencies will invoke the secretive State Secrets Privilege, which orders the employee and his family not to reveal the information or face prison**. If the family's case reaches federal court, the State Secrets Privilege is invoked and the case is shut down - and sealed. Federal judges rubber stamp the censoring of the case without reviewing the case facts.** Now that the employee's case, and in some cases their family's case, is shut down and under seal, citing \"national security,\" the process of silencing the employee is complete. Many are never heard from again, fearing prison if they talk to anyone, including an attorney.

This includes employees at all levels, from secretaries to CEOs. Once they have signed the secrecy agreement, they are bound to keep all information, including potentially illegal information, quiet, being threatened with the same penalties. **To date, over five million Americans have been required to sign this secrecy agreement and now fall under the shadow of the State Secrets Privilege.** Only a few federal employees have made it through this systematic process of destruction to reveal what they know about the illegal operation they observed. Sadly, some whistle blowers have died \"mysterious\" deaths or committed \"suicide.\" Employees in intelligence agencies are aware of penalties contained in the secrecy agreement and the huge risk in violating it, even to expose corruption. Most look the other way to protect their careers, retirements and families. Many have observed the outward signs of the system of personal and career destruction used on others and a culture of fear exists. But, they are not fully aware of all that is being done. The full scope of the system is only known at the higher levels of the organization and is hidden from employees, until its use is necessary. This is why we do not see whistle blowers coming out and reporting what they have seen. This system has been used and perfected for over fifty years. It is being used because it works. **It works, unless the system is exposed, the whistle blower knows what is coming and prepares for it, and they are supported by private organizations and individuals dedicated to truth in government.** This support is essential, not only to protect the whistle blower and their family, but also to defend our Constitutional form of government from tyranny. *Kevin M.

Without revealing anything confidential which was discussed in this meeting, I described how I eventually became convinced that President Bush was being fed information through some hidden device. As a result of that email being forwarded by many of you, my comments eventually ended up on the home page of the popular website democrats.com, with a link to all but the first two paragraphs of my email at [http://community.democrats.com/forums/discussions.cfm?forumid=170&topicid=139727](http://community.democrats.com/forums/discussions.cfm?forumid=170&topicid=139727) The reason I decided to send this email to you is that I had just received information about the strange \"let me finish\" comment Bush had made in the middle of a sentence during his first debate with Kerry on Sept. 30th. You will recall that this unusual remark was made when he still had 30 seconds left to finish his statement, and no one was trying to stop him. In my email to you, I passed on the link to a recording of this unusual remark available on the website of [NYC indymedia](http://nyc.indymedia.org/newswire/display/125456/index.php) Thanks to the wonderful network of which we are a part, this information was spread far and wide by those who are working to expose all that is going on behind the scenes. It became a hot topic on the Internet in a very short time. On Oct. 7th, just days after this remarkable recording was posted on the New York Indymedia website, the UK servers which supported 20 Indymedia websites in the US were seized by intelligence services, effectively shutting down these valuable independent news sources. Is this just another amazing coincidence? BBC reported the shocking news of these seizures on Oct. 11th, stating that the FBI had seized them, though an FBI spokesman denied this. Widely reported by major media in Britain, this startling news continues to go virtually unreported in the mainstream American media. If you want a clear example of how our freedom of speech is being eroded, I highly recommend reading this BBC article at [http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/3732718.stm](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/3732718.stm) The email I sent out to all of you on Oct. 4th was posted with my permission to democrats.com on Oct. 10th. Yesterday, Oct. 13th, I received a call from my supervisor at the US Department of State, where I have served as an interpreter for 18 years. She informed me that as a result of the information I revealed in that email, my contract as a language interpreter might be cancelled.

This woman has had extensive experience working with Bush and other presidents. In our phone conversation, she stated that she has never seen evidence of a hidden earpiece. I have only interpreted in person for Bush three times. Yet I find it very difficult to explain how he could have talked so intelligently and in such detail about Indonesia with no notes during the meeting in question. I feel strongly that in this time of rapid erosion of our constitutional rights and liberties, it is important for everyone to take risks and speak the truth. I was willing to risk my job, because this information is too important not to be shared. In fact, as a result of all this in combination with a new contract which I would have had to sign, I've decided to cancel my contract as an interpreter with the State Department. The new contract which I was sent just two weeks ago required that for the rest of my life I could never communicate about anything I learned from my work that had not been made public without explicit government approval. This is far too restrictive for my values and only increases the already excessive amount of secrecy in the US government. Below, you can read two emails which I later sent to my State Department chiefs regarding this matter. I know that by working together to expose the disempowering secrets both inside ourselves and out in the world, we can and will strengthen democracy and build a better world for ourselves and our children.

Here they are: \"In the recent Bush/Kerry debate, President Bush made a very strange, revealing comment in the middle of one of his turns talking. He had been talking for 60 seconds straight when he slipped in the comment, \"let me finish\" between his own words. He had been given 90 seconds to respond, and no one was in any way trying to cut him off. What was he referring to? Who was he talking to with this comment? The answer is that it is very possible that Bush was responding to someone who was feeding information to him through a hidden earphone. \"Listen to the [mp3](http://nyc.indymedia.org/usermedia/audio/6/bush-let_me_finish.mp3) of this comment yourself at [NYC indymedia](http://nyc.indymedia.org/newswire/display/125456/index.php), or watch the video on the C-SPAN website at: rtsp://cspanrm.fplive.net/cspan/project/c04/c04093004_debate1.rm (copy and paste this address to your web browser, then fast forward to 40 min 30 sec).\" You may or may not be aware that the UK servers which supported 20 US Indymedia websites (the link above) were confiscated in England shortly after the above news was published. You can read about this on BBC at [http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/3732718.stm](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/3732718.stm) The American press has neglected to report this significant development. The information on the \"let me finish\" comment was sent to me by someone in the network of international researchers in which I am involved. It immediately reminded me of my experience with Bush and Megawati shortly after 9/11, which eventually led to the democrats.com posting about which you called me this morning. In these days when our constitutional freedoms are rapidly being eroded, I feel it is extremely important that each of us thinks and acts with a clear intention of what is best for our nation and for all people. I felt that it was important to write the email relating my experience in order to contribute to the debate among my fellow researchers. You are right that I could have talked with other interpreters about this experience to find out if they had ever experienced anything similar. I have not done this, and wish I had time to do it. I very much appreciate your comments that you have never seen any evidence of this. I will certainly share that without mentioning your name when asked about this issue.

Even so, I would ask you what to make of my experience that day in the White House. Based on what you know, do you believe that right after 9/11, when President Bush had been in office less than one year, he could have known that much about Indonesia? I found this to be highly unusual. I don't believe stating that there were 22 talking points and that about half of them dealt with terrorism and the other half with Indonesia was revealing any sensitive information. I could easily have written \"many talking points\" rather than 22, if I believed that this was sensitive. It was mentioned on national television that they talked about both terrorism and Indonesian affairs. Was this revealing confidential information? I know and trust that you will do what you believe is right and best. I am willing to accept whatever you and others at Language Services decide.

I will send you an official resignation email and letter within the next few days. I have thoroughly enjoyed my 18 years working with [the Department of] State and working with all of you. This has by far been the most diverse, fascinating work I've ever done. Through this job, I have also encountered some of the most amazing and inspiring people I've ever met. It is clear to me, however, that my values are no longer compatible with what is required by our government to work as an interpreter.

I largely depend on three free (donation-based) Internet news sources. **Truth-Out** sends out one daily email giving only the headlines of about 10 articles. They provide a link for each headline if you want to read the full article. I simply scan the headlines for anything that grabs me. Many days nothing grabs me and I move through the email in less than a minute. Other days, I find two or three fascinating articles which I don't find in the general media.

Each email lists and numbers 10 to 25 headlines. Underneath this concise list, you can read a summary of the article or sometimes the entire article.

They developed effective coping strategies which helped them to escape the intensity of the repeated abuse. Yet these strategies tend to become deeply embedded in the unconscious. As adults, these people often have difficulty achieving deep, sustained intimate relationships because although the threat of real pain is no longer present, the coping strategies of their childhood are still applied to challenges in their relationships. Pattern Childhood physical and/or sexual abuse causes intense physical and emotional pain. The problem clearly is external in the form of a parent, relative, or other person who is inflicting unbearable pain and discomfort on me. Solution A common solution is to emotionally shut down, escape unavoidable pain by dissociating or somehow leaving my body, doing everything possible to escape the pain, abandon body in order to keep soul intact Effect Pain is largley avoided. Whenever the threat of real pain arises, dissociating allows my consciousness to escape the pain and deal with this reality without going crazy. Yet the person often has a tendency to then become more numb to life in general, develops pattern of escaping from challenging situations rather than staying present in the body and dealing with the challenge Embedded story The person subjected to regular physical and/or sexual abuse as a child develops an often unconcscious, deeply embedded story that whenever they feel emotional or physcial pain coming on, the problem is definitely out there (cuased by external factors) and the solution is to escape the emotional intensity by dissociating and doing everything possible to get away from the cause. This story tends to run the person's entire adult life unless a sustained effort is made the bring this story into full consciousness and transform it. Transformation Though the problem for the child suffering abuse clearly was external and dissociation was an effective means of dealing with the problem, once the child grows into an adult, they are usually able to get away from the perpetrator(s). They now have a much greater degree of control over their lives. However, when big challenges arise with a partner, their natural tendency is to do what worked in the past and escape the problem by dissosociating and running away from the person. If they are successful in escaping the source of the problem (their partner), they then feel much better as they perceive the problem has gone away and they can go on with their lives free of that threat. Yet in adulthood, this repeating pattern almost always results in less intimacy and the inability to face pain consciously and work to transform it consciously with a partner.

Yet in adulthood, this repeating pattern almost always results in less intimacy and the inability to face pain consciously and work to transform it consciously with a partner. Often these people will not be able to stay in a relationship very long because as soon as big challenges come up triggering intense emotions, as inevitable happens in relationships, they will run from their partner fully believing that is the best way to deal with the problem due to the unconscious patterns of their childhood. These patterns were effective in childhood, yet in adulthood have the effect of creating a pattern of running from partners and situations in which there is the real possibility of growth and transformation if they are willing to change their pattern which is stuck in the past. Steps to transformation Bring childhood patterns fully conscious, recognize that this is a story which now runs your life When you get strongly triggered emotionally, recognize what happens and the intense desire to dissociate and run from the source of the problem. Realize that when there is no real physical threat, there is the opportunity to face the emotional pain, to face the challenge and transform your pattern in order to find a way to deeper love and intimacy.

Governments, religions, and other major institutions of humanity have formed along hierarchical structures intended originally to empower those with the most knowledge and insight to use their abilities for the betterment of all humankind. The very nature, however, of placing some people above others creates an inequality from which strife often grows. Those given power in this hierarchical system have often been magnetized and even addicted by this power and used it to maintain or build upon their power, often to the detriment of those below them in the hierarchy. Some of those in the lower rungs of the hierarchy greatly envy the power they perceive in those above them and fight to climb the ladder. At the same time, others in the lower rungs fight against the inequality they perceive in the hierarchical system. When the inequality in these systems becomes too great, it is only natural that some sort of revolution happens. As a result, the old hierarchy is torn down and those who once had power are quashed. Yet before long a new hierarchy is built with the same inherent problems of the old. Only when the collective consciousness of all involved becomes aware that the drive for power. Fred's stuff Could it be that we are simply remembering who we are? Could it be that we consciously chose to fragment ourselves and draw veils over our own consciousness in order to bring more richness to our individual and collective experience of life? And as we gradually lift the veils and remember who we are, each of us brings back an invaluable packet of experience and wisdom which greatly increases the collective experience of us all. Life is consciousness experiencing itself. For each one of us, it is our consciousness having the experience of interacting with the environment in which we find ourselves and reacting to what we perceive around us and what we perceive is happening to us. Reality is ultimately subjective. Life for each individual is their personal experience of reality. It is a subjective experience which is influenced by the people and environment in which the individual finds themself. \"Life is the wholeness of experience flowing past the individual's field of perception in the present moment.

Our higher selves consist of a range of fairly well defined frequencies which make up a fairly harmonious rainbow spectrum. The higher self is a part of the our being and even our consciousness in some way I don't understand, yet it exists in a kind of higher octave of reality. Our normal consciousness inhabiting these physical bodies is made up of a range of frequencies that are often not very harmonious. They are fairly blurred and not clearly defined. The energetic signature of most people on Earth is generally kind of messy or even very messy. By setting clear intentions in life and choosing to live those intentions, the frequencies of our consciousness become less messy, more well defined, and can more harmonize with the frequencies of our higher self and other people around us. And our normal consciousness can use the higher self for reference. We can tap into these higher frequencies whenever we consciously choose to do so in order to bring more divine guidance and harmony into our lives. When a person chooses to live in service to all beings, they allow the higher self to come in and more consciously work with them. In this way, the more expanded octave of the higher self can be brought into physical reality as one refines their energy in a very harmonious way.

I suspect this is how we are unconsciously drawn towards some people and situations and repelled by others. Feelings: To know is to be conscious. The more we know, the more conscious we are and the more consciously we can make choices amidst all the mystery. Feelings carry charge and energy that we can use in our quest to know and expand. The more consciously we embrace our feelings and accept them, the more we can learn from them. **Energy and Consciousness** E=mC2, mC2=E, m=E/C2 All mass is a form of energy Consciousness, conscious awareness You consciousness can generate and receive energy Tone. When you tone, you are generating energy and broadcasting it out into the world around you, the universe. When you listen, you are receiving energy, receiving information from the world around you, universe Though we tend to be more focused on generating or receiving, you can even both generate and receive at the same time. Our consciousness resides in a physical body. There is consciousness. In every waking moment you have conscious awareness. Your conscious awareness is reading these words. It is also likely reacting to these words. It is quickly deciding whether these words are worth your time. In every moment you also have choice. As you read these words right now, you have choice over whether you stop reading this right now, whether you skim through all of this, or whether you You have a body. This body give you five physical senses with which to experience the world around you. You are condition to adapt into this 3D 5S world. Though you may feel very alone at times, you are not alone.

When you are fully and harmoniously connected with the energy of the universe, you live in love with all. Each of us is an individuated conscious awareness experiencing life from our own unique perspective within an infinite field of consciousness and energy. While each of us is an individuated consciousness, our core essence is interconnected with the core of every other conscious awareness in the universe. On the deepest levels, we are all interconnected in this wild and wonderful dance of life and consciousness exploring itself. Every consciousness originates from the same divine source, so in our deepest essence, every one of us is also divine. In this core place, we are all engaged in a beautiful, ever-expanding exploration of both our uniqueness and our interconnectedness in this ever-unfolding sacred moment. To make the dance of life more rich, meaningful, and growth-inducing, those of us here as humans have agreed to forget our core interconnectedness in order to explore deep into the powerful dance of separation. We have immersed ourselves into this dense physical world, each with our own unique human body as our instruments of exploration. By submitting to a collective field of agreement that, while in a human body, we will allow our minds to perceive each other as separate beings, we actually create the possibility for accelerated spiritual growth. By perceiving ourselves and each other through the limited filters of our five senses within the constraints of three dimensions of space and a linear flow of time, we create greater individuation and many new possibilities for deeper exploration into both separation and connection. What maintains the sense of separation and sometimes aloneness that we feel in these bodies is largely our minds through the beliefs we have taken on as a result of growing up in this world. When we were first born here and our mind was not yet developed, we naturally felt connected with all around us. We hadn't yet learned what it means to be separate. Yet because we grew up dependent on adults who had also been strongly conditioned by the collective agreements of humanity, most of us ended up taking on these collective agreements and beliefs about reality. Though in more superficial aspects some may have rebelled against the beliefs and agreements of those around us, very few questioned the deeper agreements about our separateness and the limitations of the physical world. And exceedingly few of us were aware of the multi-layered energetic realms beyond physical reality.

Though in more superficial aspects some may have rebelled against the beliefs and agreements of those around us, very few questioned the deeper agreements about our separateness and the limitations of the physical world. And exceedingly few of us were aware of the multi-layered energetic realms beyond physical reality. Yet ever more people on this planet are now re-awakening to the deeper interconnectedness beneath the physical reality in which we live. Many are realizing that the physical world is but a superficial aspect of a much deeper level of being where we are all in constant energetic communication. In the old paradigm, the vast majority of people on Earth were focused largely on matters of survival and competition. This kept them focused primarily on the dance of separation. In the new paradigm many of us are now co-creating, we pierce the veils of the three-dimensional, five-sensory world to behold and begin to integrate the divine beauty and interconnectedness of every one of us individually and all of us collectively. When we choose to recognize and experience this deeper interconnectedness ever more deeply in our daily lives, we can begin to experience a richness in life far beyond what is available to those focused on the five senses and on old-paradigm concepts of space and time. The more we open our conscious awareness to the deeper energetic connection with all around us, the more likely that our lives will be filled with miracles and rich transformation. As many of us now awaken to the infinite well love and wisdom that lies within ourselves and all beings, we are embracing our role as pioneers of a new paradigm where we can reap the benefits of exploring the many mysteries of both separation and connectedness. **Collective Consciousness** When we generate together, we create a collective field of consciousness whose powers are magnified exponentially. If the collective field is focused on fear ... if on love and healing ... In any moment there are thousands upon thousands of people around the globe meditating. Many of these are focused on spreading love and healing. When we choose to feel our connection with all of these people and add our energy, the field grows by more than just your energy, yours helps to multiply the energy of others and thus create even more transformation in our world. Our spirits at their inner core are all interconnected. How can they not be? Our outer manifestations appear separate, allowing us to play and co-create the game, the mystery of life. To be One, truly One, and the only One is to lose everything but consciousness.

To be One, truly One, and the only One is to lose everything but consciousness. As One there is no we, only an eternal me with nothing to interact with. How sad and boring. And so I/we chose and continue to choose to be me, you, and we, to play this mysterious game of life I/we co-created. It is so much richer than just me. I am one who wants to know, yet I realize the by opening to too much too quickly, I can burn my out circuits and thus be less useful for all of us. I want to know and to open to the deeper realities only as fast as serves all of us together. I am one who knows that we are all interconnected, as I have come to accept the darkness, the light, and All That Is within myself. Ever increasing numbers of people in this world are also coming to this awareness. The more who join in celebrating and serving all of us - the good, the bad, and the ugly - with ever increasing conscious choice, the more beautifully and harmoniously we can play together with each other and with All That Is. The more I/we know, the more conscious I am and we are, and the more consciously I/we can make choices amidst all the apparent chaos and mystery. Fear is but an invitation to growth, if we choose to let it be so. If matter cannot be destroyed or disappear, how is that so many believe that consciousness can be destroyed or disappear. Does that really make sense? Does consciousness simple come into existence out of nowhere when we are born and then disappear into nowhere when we die? What are we without consciousness? I am increasingly coming to see that what we are is a point of consciousness interacting with a perceived external world co-created by the collective of all consciousnesses in existence. Each consciousness is made up of a complex range of frequencies creating a unique and individual signature. How our unique energetic signature interacts with the unique signatures of those around us makes all the difference. Reason #1 : Humans Are Not Lemmings!

Perception and judgment. **The Dance of Shadow and Light** Are you afraid of your own shadow? Finding the right balance that is most nurturing and supportive to each of us allows us to live more fully in the present moment and ever deepen our connections with all around us. We unconsciously create blocks to experiencing greater realities by the suppression of our fears or shadow. As we open to learning to dance with our shadows, to use our fears as potential teachers, we can break through those blocks. Shadow: Plot to seize the white house.

The next great movement of evolutionary love is waiting for you - for each of us - to identify and manifest your unique creativity. It is asking you to recognize yourself as the artist of your life, and then to broaden your artistry until you are creating in the service of All That Is. Are you ready to respond to this great invitation to evolutionary creativity, in the service of our own evolution, and the evolution of All That Is? If you are then you have begun to wake up, and that is simply fucking awesome! Quote by Marc Gafni \"It's easy to take off all your clothes and have sex. People do it all the time. But opening up your soul to someone, Letting them into your spirit, thoughts, fears, future, hopes, dreams .... That's being naked\" Everything in existence is made up of energetic fields. Every piece of the universe is alive in its own way, deriving from the same sacred source. All of existence is interconnected in a divine cosmic dance where the largest and smallest all play equal roles in the unfolding of consciousness that is life. - me Life's deeper essence is not an absolute to be experienced by the chosen few, but an evolving, dynamic intelligence that wears as many faces as there are life forms. No group or people has the exclusive portal into the universe by which the Divine expresses itself in all its majesty. The portal is available to all, because the Divine is within all things. -- WingMakers The quintessential masculine is a flow outward from center. It courageously journeys forth, exploring the power of individuation and separation. The quintessential feminine is a flow inward towards center. It lovingly embraces the magic of union with All That Is. The creative masculine has become dominant over the surrendering feminine in the past several thousand years. Yet there is now a call for a return to balance between masculine and feminine. Let us help welcome the beauty of the feminine back into loving, dynamic balance. \"Dear Human: You've got it allllll wrong. You didn't come here to master unconditional love.

I am deeply dedicated to what's best for all of us. This has been my unwavering intention and main guiding force for over 20 years now. Through the popular websites I manage, I have gotten to know quite a number of other powerful spiritual activists on our planet, like you. As recently I've been getting some really deep, powerful information, I realized just today that it would be good to form a special list for those of my fellow movers and shakers who are most in the know, and who really want to better understand the depths and expansiveness of all that is happening in our world and beyond. You are one of these wonderful people. This list has 24 names, including three leaders of the 9/11 movement, two top experts in mind control, two leading figures in the UFO movement, the most knowledgeable individual I know in the new energy movement, three people with amazing email lists reaching many thousands, and several prominent, respected leaders in their transformational communities. I have a personal connection with every one of you and greatly admire your work. What distinguishes you all from my many other friends, is that each of you not only has a wealth of knowledge about the many aspects of all that has been hidden, but is also willing to look deep into the shadow with the intention of developing greater understanding, so that we can better work to transform our lives and world. I will use this list sparingly, only when I get really deep information that can make a big difference. I suspect on average I will send out less than one email a month. If you'd rather not be on the list, please don't hesitate to let me know. You are more than welcome to share anything I send with anyone who you believe will benefit from the information. I am dedicated to total transparency and to spreading empowering knowledge and inspiration to all who want to know. I've just recently received some tremendously powerful information I invite you to take a look at. I've already sent this information to many of you personally, which is what led me to form this list.

As always, I invite you to be skeptical, yet open to what is presented. Here's one of my favorite quotes from this piece: *\"Remember, always, that this is a beautiful Game that we are playing here and co-creating together, with our Infinite Creator. And that \"off stage\" (between lives) we are the very best of friends, and that no one really \"dies\" and no one really \"suffers\", except in the Game. The Game is not Reality. Reality is Reality, and you have the Power to Express your Reality within the Game, once you have learnt how to do so.\"* Project Camelot interviews Jessica: A Crystal Child Speaks Out [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3NEASRRImg](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3NEASRRImg) The first half of the interview is a bit scattered, though it gives good background information. The second half of this video gets really good. I guarantee this young woman will inspire you and get you thinking. If you don't know about Project Camelot at [http://projectcamelot.org](http://projectcamelot.org), they are the best out there at interviewing key insiders and using the results to pull together the big picture of all that is happening.

He's given me intriguing reports of what it's like there. In case you don't know about this magical spiritual center, an article in the Daily Mail of the U.K. is a great place to start. The photos in this article are stunning!

He wrote a great piece, which I'm including here for you below. You can also check out the Damanhur website at [http://www.damanhur.org](http://www.damanhur.org). Wishing you and all of us abundant love, inspiration, and joy, Fred July 13, 2009 **Dane's Delightfully Discombobulating Damanhurian Experience** I came to Damanhur restless, an E.T./human hybrid searching for some place that felt more sane than the world I grew up in. Finding just that, I found myself struggling with a new problem: how to understand it using the filters and measuring devices I had learned in order to survive in a world that places money, power and appearance above all else. Damanhur is a complex series of eco-systems that more than most places only makes sense when laid against a backdrop of the future. In a very real way Damanhur exists in the future and over the past thirty years a growing number of people have dedicated their lives to manifesting that future in the here and now. Many of the Damanhurians who have made this commitment find that the spiritual challenge of becoming something more than they were in order to serve the future that is Damanhur is a reward rich enough to let go of a system of choices based solely on personal gratification. What is Damanhur? To the people who live here it is them. It is who they are and who they are becoming. To my westerm mind that measures the external reality that is now, Damanhur is a community of of forty families of twenty people, each with a unique focus that serves the Damanhur vision. It is home of the worlds largest underground temple, breaking a guinness world record, that Damanhurians have voluntarily built over the past thirty years. Damanhur is steward to approximately 150 hecters of land, which they are transforming into a self-sustaining eco-system. It has also a school for both children and adults, a medical center using cutting edge alternative methods, a center for elderly care and a network of eco-businesses that are supported by their own currency: the Credito. Oh... and it is also the home of the largest \"Selfic Device\" on the planet, a system from Atlantis that involves using ritual and geometric shapes to bring consciousness from", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:insider__09_damanhur_information.txt:0:5b8089d30bdb", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 11504, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "insider__09_damanhur_information.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "insider__09_damanhur_information", "chunk_index": 1, "text": "approximately 150 hecters of land, which they are transforming into a self-sustaining eco-system.

Oh... and it is also the home of the largest \"Selfic Device\" on the planet, a system from Atlantis that involves using ritual and geometric shapes to bring consciousness from other dimensions into symbiotic relationship with human beings in ways that support mutual well-being. What makes Damanhur unique in many eyes is its ability to survive, thrive and grow as a completely unique entity on the planet over thirty years, while simultaneously integrating harmoniously with its existing cultural and physical environment. By all appearances they have an excellent relationship with the five thousand residents that share their valley and count the local mayor among their members. All this while making no secret of the fact that the temples are the product of a vision gifted by beings from beyond our world. I spent nine days at Damanhur. One of the dis-orienting things as a visitor from the west is the complete lack of emphasis on details. The important thing around here appears to be bringing the vision to earth; the how is incidental, ever changing, and flexible. Answering my many practical questions appears to be a low priority in this hive of busy volunteers on a mission to act. Budgets and schedules appear to be secondary to contributing one's best self to something bigger. It is hard for me to argue with their approach as it has consistently led them to create more of what they value in unique ways. For example, almost every Damanhurian receives a prana energy session two to four times a month from a wrinkled old woman named Daga, who radiates the energy of the wise crone archetype. Spending just six minutes with her took me into an altered state that I integrated over the rest of the day. The choice of Damanhurians to maintain a clear energy field around themselves has big paybacks and they have found a way to give this to themselves through cooperation and generosity. This is one of the cleanest energetic spaces I have visited. I get the sense that, like the land they buy, restore and develop, they are consciously raising the frequency and clarity of vibration throughout the area. The vast majority of Damanhurian also own personalized jewelry that is designed energetically to support their individual well-being. It is a joy to once again see a population that celebrates art and wears a living magic. These pieces are one of the products of the selfic research conducted by the founder, Falco, who has been exploring partnerships with other consciousness for most of the past thirty years. As a result,", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:insider__09_damanhur_information.txt:1:e04479d8df24", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 11505, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "insider__09_damanhur_information.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "insider__09_damanhur_information", "chunk_index": 2, "text": "raising the frequency and clarity of vibration throughout the area.

These pieces are one of the products of the selfic research conducted by the founder, Falco, who has been exploring partnerships with other consciousness for most of the past thirty years. As a result, while a number of Damanhurians are poor in terms of cash, they are some of the richest people in the world when it comes to a supportive environment for their children, ecological well-being, beauty art and health that goes beyond the physical body to include the spiritual self. Along these same lines one of the highlights of my visit was witnessing the music of plants, whose electrical impulses were fed through a translator into musical notes. The music was captivating, and while listening I had one of the most intense energetic relationships with plants in my life. As a professional high-end landscaper this was quite special for me. Although all of this is impressive it is not as impressive to me as the people who live here. Many of them have unusual qualities of courtesy, self-confidence, humor and vitality. I have the sense that the women here are equal partners because their femininity is valued for the unique gifts it brings, not because they behave like men. In many cases the women appear to have a stronger voice. Watching them move through the world with an appreciation of their own unique beauty and choosing to grace the world with it, I notice how much everyone loses to the degree femininity is devalued in other parts of the world. One of the things I did to move beyond my experience as a \"tourist\" was volunteer to help one of the teachers move their school to a new building. Watching the community come together for this project, I felt warmed by the awareness of what it must be like to live in a community in which everyone is constantly witnessing one another taking concrete steps to improve the lives of every other member of the community. The most mundane chores appear to be treated as a form of meditation, more than drudgery. Damanhur is a place of giving to a larger sense of self that is coming in from outside our dimensions. It is a process of understanding that goes beyond logic in ways that allow extraordinary things to emerge from the synergy of ordinary people. In a very real way I observe Damanhurians, with their own constitutional vows and school of ritualized meditation, creating a resonance vortice through which they can more easily receive non-linear information, which they then use to both inform their vision and execute it.

They hold the truth of what will be, and with commitment, focus and creativity, set in motion the tangible causes to invite that into form. One of the people I talked with, a successful businessman who left his life in the west to join Damanhur, told me that watching Damanhur survive through all of it's many internal transformations and emerge stronger and more vital every time is the greatest proof of magic he has seen. There is something here that leads eight hundred people, including many who donate everything they have, to dedicate themselves to an idealistic life and an other-worldly vision. Seeing people go to work, support a school, maintain their house, participate in a path of meditation, contribute time to build the ever-growing network of temples, and then show up fully for a number of complex rituals that bring spirituality to life is a challenging concept for me to understand. Some of their members have been doing this, along with redesigning the whole community structure, vision, and purpose several times, for thirty years, yet they come across to me as significantly more present and engaged than the average person. As Damanhurians have told me several times, \"impossible is not in our vocabulary.\" You can learn more about Damanhur by visiting their website at [http://www.damanhur.org](http://www.damanhur.org). They are going through a transition period right now that involves learning to reach out to the world. Their new welcome center, staffed mostly by volunteers with no formal training, has it's glitches, so don't take it personally if they don't write back to your e-mails (mine were repeatedly lost or ignored in one of their reorganization processes). They may have a full moon ritual to attend that day (a magnificent ritual I had the pleasure of witnessing), a family meeting to attend to, or work to do expanding the world's largest underground temple. With patience you may come to enjoy the people and appreciate their energy, as I have. *Dane is a writer, energetic sculptor, poet and landscaper.

Even though I am very selective on who joins this list, please feel free to share anything I post in whatever way you feel supports transformation. ** Archetypes of Consciousness** Consider the possibility that our lives as humans are influenced on deep, unconscious levels by various archetypal forces which operate largely in realms beyond the time/space dimension. These timeless archetypes seem to be reflections of deep emotions and beliefs held in the collective consciousness of humanity. They are expressed and explored in our world through individuals and groups who resonate with the various archetypes. Though their form of expression changes and is refined with the passage of time and the evolution of humanity, the core essence of the archetypes seems to have changed little in the recorded history of our planet. It appears that each of us are somehow both consciously and unconsciously aligned with a certain constellation of these archetypal forces, which then operate through us and interact with us to play a vital role in manifesting our unique sojourn through life. The more conscious we are of the archetypal forces with which we are aligned, the more choice we have in how we interact with them to better support growth and transformation. Among all of these many forces, I've found that two of the key underlying archetypal forces affecting humanity on Earth are the feminine and masculine. A key aspect of the feminine archetype is that it largely is focused on service to others, like a nurturing mother in service to her family. The masculine archetype is more focused on service to self, as in the hunter/breadwinner competing with others to climb to the top of his game. Men and woman either consciously or unconsciously tend to align themselves with one of these two aspects. Though the majority of men are aligned with service to self, some are more aligned with the feminine aspect of service to others. And similarly, though most women are aligned with service to others, some more resonate with the masculine aspect of service to self. And we all to some degree tap into both of these in our journey through life. When practiced with a high level of integrity and consciousness, both service to self", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:insider__10_archetypes_consciousness.txt:1:27a09da6ed13", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 11510, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "insider__10_archetypes_consciousness.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "insider__10_archetypes_consciousness", "chunk_index": 2, "text": "one of these two aspects.

And similarly, though most women are aligned with service to others, some more resonate with the masculine aspect of service to self. And we all to some degree tap into both of these in our journey through life. When practiced with a high level of integrity and consciousness, both service to self and service to others can lead towards greater connection, yet when integrity is compromised or unconscious choices are made, they can also cause greater separation. When service to self is acted upon to the harm or detriment of those around us, it leads to separation from others, which in turn can cause separation from self. In a similar manner, when service to others places others above self, it tends to lead to neglect of and separation from one's self, which in turn can cause separation from others. There is an alternative to the choice between service to self and service to others. Service to all is inclusive of both service to self and service to others. By living in service to all beings, to All That Is, one can avoid the common trap of slipping into duality and polarization which can result by overly focusing on either service to self or others. In choosing service to all as a primary life intention, I've found it is much easier to stay on course towards ever greater love, growth, and transformation. Living in conscious service to all naturally encourages a greater awareness of the bigger picture and embraces and nurtures all aspects and forces within both ourselves and the universe in our dance with life. My favorite saying along these lines is \"I give all that I am into the service of All That Is.\" ** Note:** Some of this has been inspired by meditations and medicine journeys I've experienced. It has also been inspired by learning about how key figures on our planet have used magic and archetypal forces to influence life on our planet. Three controversial people in particular keep popping up in my explorations: [Aleister Crowley](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aleister_Crowley) (infamous master of magick and head of the [OTO](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordo_Templi_Orientis)), [L. Ron Hubbard](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L._Ron_Hubbard) (Scientology founder), and [Jack Parsons](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Parsons) (JPL co-founder involved with Hubbard in [Babalon Working](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Babalon_Working)). All three of these individuals knew each other and were focused on service to self with a stated desire to serve the greater Self. Using mind-altering drugs, magic, sexuality, and science, they were playing very consciously with many archetypal forces, with their primary focus being the archetypal force of service to self. Yet many times their actions served themselves at the expense of those around them, leading to lots of confusion, conflicts, and even craziness. These three appear to have played a key role in all of the", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:insider__10_archetypes_consciousness.txt:2:a5a618c2c35a", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 11511, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "insider__10_archetypes_consciousness.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "insider__10_archetypes_consciousness", "chunk_index": 3, "text": "and were focused on service to self with a stated desire to serve the greater Self.

Thank you for the rich and stimulating ideas and conversation.

Titled \"Dark Forces and the Coming Transformation,\" I highly recommend exploring this piece at the link below: [**http://www.reconnections.net/dark_forces_transformation.htm**](http://www.reconnections.net/dark_forces_transformation.htm) This thought-provoking essay invites us to open to the power and joy of learning to dance with both the shadow and the light. I hope to eventually incorporate this incisive writing into the Divine Mystery website, which I plan to develop before too long. **Secret Societies and the Occult** In the last year, I've been doing some fascinating explorations into the role of secret societies and the occult on our planet. It's been surprising in my readings how many times I've run across certain names like L. Ron Hubbard (Scientology founder, check this link for fascinating info regarding Scientology and remote viewing), Andrija Puharich (intelligence, remote viewing, mind control, and more), and Aleister Crowley (of the occult organization OTO). Yet going back even further in history -- over four centuries -- many times I've run into the name John Dee as a very important and instrumental player in the occult world. Hubbard and Crowley are just two key players who were deeply influenced by his scholarly and occult work. In certain esoteric circles, Dee's work is still very highly esteemed. **Introducing John Dee** John Dee (1527-1608) was one of the most influential and deeply educated people who laid the foundations for the enlightenment and all modern sciences. Yet he also devoted much of his life to the study of alchemy, divination, and Hermetic philosophy, which were very accepted and honored fields of study in his day. According to the wikipedia entry on Dee, \"He devoted much time and effort in the last thirty years or so of his life to attempting to commune with angels in order to learn the universal language of creation and bring about the pre-apocalyptic unity of mankind.\" Dee had the largest library in England and one of the largest in all Europe. He also served as an occasional adviser and tutor to Queen Elizabeth. There is evidence that the Rosicrucian Order grew directly out of his esoteric explorations. His influence on occult organizations like the OTO (Ordo Templi Orientis) is fully acknowledged.

[**http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Dee**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Dee) I offer this information for those who might want to explore deeper the influence of the occult and secret societies on what is happening in our world today. I believe this influence is far greater than most people would ever suspect. I learned a lot about just how deep all of this goes from an eye-opening book by Peter Moon (aka Vince Barbarick) titled \"Synchronicity and the Seventh Seal.\" It is the best single book I've read yet on this intriguing topic. One of the things I do when reading potentially powerful material by an author is to make spot checks of \"facts\" presented in their work. If it is really good stuff, I will do a dozen or more spot checks, as I did on Peter Moon's fascinating book. These spot checks showed that though Moon will occasionally exaggerate to prove his point, he has done excellent research in putting together information which is quite difficult to find synthesized elsewhere. I also have a friend who knows this man personally. She says his research is generally high quality, though he is a very strange man who she doesn't fully trust. With that in mind, if you have knowledge and interest in these matters, I do highly recommend \"Synchronicity and the Seventh Seal.\" **The Veil** On a somewhat related topic, I've been exploring a lot recently into the split between this physical reality based in time and space and the other side of the veil (non-traditional dimensions and altered states of reality). It seems that long ago a huge block or veil was somehow created to keep these realities separate. I suspect that our three-dimensional world was somehow created by beings on both sides of the veil, i.e. from both the realms of time/space and the spirit world. I've also come to suspect that many, if not most beings in these two differing realms in some way fear or at least strongly judge each other. I'm actually having fun exploring how to build bridges between these worlds and invite beings on both sides to transcend fear and judgment and work together for the good of us all. It's quite exciting stuff that I hope to include in the Divine Mystery website, whenever I get time to focus some attention there.

Wishing you and all of us abundant love, inspiration, and joy, Fred December 3, 2010 **Musings of an inquisitive spirit on life and consciousness** The only place we ever exist is at the center of our own consciousness. The only time we ever exist is right now. We are all consciousness exploring itself in this ever-expanding sacred moment. Somehow my consciousness reaches through space to encounter you. Somehow a connection is made and our separate consciousnesses become aware of each other, allowing us to engage in the dance of life. I am able to include you in my consciousness experience, just as you include me, and that makes life richer for both of us. As we open our consciousness ever more to all that is around us, we engage ever more fully with all around us in this process we call life. Even though I am always here at the center of my own consciousness, I find I am continually expanding my awareness to include ever more of all around me. The more I feel connected with all around me and open to All That Is, the more I and my consciousness grow and blossom. I've seen that the more I am able to embrace all that I perceive and encounter with love and compassion, the more my consciousness expands, and the more rich my experience of life becomes. We are all exploring this thing called life as we connect with ourselves and with all around us from the center of our own consciousness. Yet many end up feeling quite alone or isolated at times in this journey. They explore deep into the feeling of separation, often only to find it lacking in richness and depth. Yet there is value in all experiences, including both separation and connection. I suspect that somehow each one of our consciousnesses is like an individuated fragment within the greater mind or consciousness of All That Is. We are each individuated cells in the mind of God. My/our consciousness is somehow an inseparable part of the universal consciousness, even when I/we may feel all alone. Though all of this resonates strongly for me, I really don't know how it works. How can there be a greater or universal consciousness of which I'm a part, when my only direct experience of life is what I experience in my own consciousness?

I know that we are all somehow interconnected on the deeper or more expanded energetic levels, yet only occasionally do I get glimpses of this in my daily life. It is truly a divine mystery which I continue to love exploring. This thing called existence is strange indeed. Yet I somehow have no doubt that it is all an amazing miracle, too, if only I/we choose to open to it. May all of us be blessed with ever more abundant miracles and the joy of loving interconnectedness. **See our [exceptional archive](https://www.WantToKnow.info/indexnewsarticles) of revealing news articles.** **Please support this important work: [Donate here](https://www.WantToKnow.info/donationswtk.php)** Explore the mind and heart expanding websites managed by the nonprofit PEERS network: [www.peerservice.org](https://www.peerservice.org) - PEERS websites: Spreading inspiration, education, & empowerment [www.momentoflove.org](https://www.momentoflove.org) - Every person in the world has a heart [www.personalgrowthcourses.net](https://www.personalgrowthcourses.net) - Dynamic online courses powerfully expand your horizons [www.WantToKnow.info](https://www.WantToKnow.info) - Reliable, verifiable information on major cover-ups [www.weboflove.org](https://www.weboflove.org) - Strengthening the Web of Love that interconnects us all [Subscribe](https://www.WantToKnow.info/subscribe) to the WantToKnow.info email list (two messages a week)", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:insider__10_john_dee_occult_shadow_light.txt:3:e2b7d75839a1", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 11517, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "insider__10_mind_control_information.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "insider__10_mind_control_information", "chunk_index": 0, "text": "Information on Mind Control **Mind Control Disturbing Information on Mind Control** Hey wonderful 'In the Know' friends, This message is being sent only to my friends who have a very deep and broad understanding of all that is going on in our world both related to major cover-ups of which few are aware and to powerfully inspiring movements reflecting a deep spiritual shift on our planet.

I do not recommend this information for any who are sensitive about graphic torture or who are easily upset by stories of dark forces who want to control our world. Please do not read this if that is you. I also recommend extreme caution for survivors of mind control programs with this information, as it can trigger suicide programming. For those who are still interested and open to learning about this, I suggest waiting to find a good time and place to read this message, so that you don't get overwhelmed or overly upset. I also highly recommend opening to spiritual guidance before you delve into this, asking for what is best for you to know in all of this, and for what you can do to help transform it. I cannot verify anything shared here, so please realize that this is one man's testimony. At the same time, it is very much in line with all that I have learned about mind control programs. Though I have extensive knowledge of these programs based on solid, easily verifiable information, my in-depth conversation with this courageous insider helped me to fill in some missing pieces of the puzzle on torture and mind control.

And remember that even those who committed this torture have hearts and once were innocent babies. Let's do our very best to stop the torture and destructive behavior, yet still honor the divine soul in every person on our planet. **Background** L is the name I'm using for the person who shared the below stories with me personally a while back on his involvement in military mind control programs. He gave me permission to share any of his stories, asking only that I not reveal his name. L comes across as a very sincere, warm, and friendly man who showed amazingly little anger as he shared these disturbing stories. He did say, however, that he hopes those who committed these atrocities will get their just reward. What I've written here is based only on what I remember of my face to face conversations with L, so some of the details may be mistaken. I first wrote this up two days after we talked. I think you will understand how his stories opened my eyes to a deeper level of deception and control than I had known exists in our world. Yet I also have no doubt that we are transforming all of this. L is very unusual in that, unlike most involved in deep mind control programs, he has continuous memory of almost everything that happened throughout his experiences. He used his will and divine connections to avoid splitting into alter personalities, which are used to create amnesia in most people involved in these mind control programs. Apparently his handlers didn't realize they were not successful in splitting his personality. Of the hundreds of stories I've heard from survivors of these programs, this is the first time I've heard experiences from someone who does not rely upon recovered memories. He remembers what he experienced directly. He said he doesn't remember everything, but believes he probably remembers something like 80% of his experiences in these programs. **Strange Church Service** One memory from L's early childhood stands out related to these programs. I believe he said that this happened sometime when he was around six or seven years old. L's father was a military man, so that he grew up on various military bases. His family went to church every Sunday. He does not remember missing a Sunday service before this particular event.

I believe he said that this happened sometime when he was around six or seven years old. L's father was a military man, so that he grew up on various military bases. His family went to church every Sunday. He does not remember missing a Sunday service before this particular event. On the Sunday of this incident, he had been sick and in the base hospital for a few days. As he was feeling pretty good that day, he decided not to miss the Sunday service and went to the chapel on his own. When L got to the chapel door, he heard some voices inside and decided to wait for the right time to go in. As he listened to what they were saying through the door, it sounded a bit strange. Most of what they were doing sounded like normal Bible reading from a church service, but instead of talking about God and Jesus, they kept using the word Lucifer. When the time felt right to enter and L finally opened the door to go in, he was taken aback to see a group of people gathered in a circle dressed in long brown robes with hoods over their heads. This scared him. He quickly closed the door and scurried back toward his hospital room, feeling quite shaken. But he was seen by the group. Before long, a man from the chapel caught up to him and asked him how long he had been there. He said he had just opened the door and realized he was in the wrong place. The man threatened him not to tell anyone what he had seen. **Broken Arm Operation** L broke his arm at age eight. Somehow the doctors set the bones in the arm wrong, so that a second operation was required to fix it. While he was in the hospital being prepared for the second surgery, he remembers being flown in the middle of the night to a military hospital in another city and then flown back. I don't remember his description of what happened while he was in the other city, but there were some strange occurrences. On the day of this second surgery, before going under in anesthesia, L was instructed to memorize and repeat 10 short phrases as the anesthesia was applied. He remembers that phrase three was \"kill your mother.\" Another was \"down the rabbit hole.\" When he questioned the one about kill your mother, he was told the words didn't have any real meaning, though it was important that he repeat all of the phrases as he went unconscious.

When they then began to take him under, he went through the phrases until going unconscious, but refused to say \"kill your mother.\" On awakening from the anesthesia, a woman was there staring directly into his eyes as he came to. She continued to stare intensely into his eyes without a word for a long time. Eventually she did some things acting as if she were his mother in some way. I don't remember the details, but it was clear she was trying to convince L that she was his mother. After he emphatically refused to accept her as mother, she was sent away. **Base Commander Test** That same year, L was taken secretly to meet the base commander one evening. As he was escorted into the commander's office, L managed to just catch a glimpse of a boy being escorted out another door. The boy was clearly disturbed and crying. The commander strangely was sitting at his desk in nothing but his underwear. The base commander explained to L that if he wanted to grow up to be powerful and important like himself, he would need to agree to everything that the commander ordered him to do from now on. He offered all kinds of gifts and more if L would agree to do this. L found this all very strange and uncomfortable. When for starters, the commander instructed L to begin by giving him a blow job, L refused. After several failed attempts to convince him, L was then escorted out of the room. This was strikingly similar to an experience I had myself at age 10 with the owner of a large amusement part on the south side of Jersey City in New Jersey. Around the same time, L's dad was offered to join some kind of secret society on the base. Before long his dad expressed disgust with the group to his wife, not knowing that L was quietly listening in on the conversation from an unseen place. L's dad quit the group and returned a special ring he had been given. Could this society have been related to the worshippers of Lucifer in the brown robes? **Programmed Assassin** As he grew up, L was brought into secret military mind control programs and involved in strange trainings. By the age of 20, he was under training to be an assassin. He still remembers the name of the first person he was to assassinate.

By the age of 20, he was under training to be an assassin. He still remembers the name of the first person he was to assassinate. The man was not anyone well known, which made him wonder why he was chosen a target. On one of many drills, L was brought by trained scuba divers underwater on training missions. L was not happy to be in this program, though initially he did not make this known to anyone. Before the time came to carry out his first assassination, L was actually thankful to have been hit by a car and become physically handicapped as a result. Because of his permanent disability as a result of this accident, he was kicked out of the mind control program. He is very thankful that this accident kept him from going down a very different road. He has had little contact with the people in the programs since then, though there were a couple strange experiences he described which I don't remember. But before the accident, L was already resisting some of his training openly. This is when the two most disturbing incidents happened which shook him to the core. **I Want Out** In the first incident, as L has now openly declared that he wants to leave the program, he begins to get harassed. He eventually gets into a bad fight with several uniformed guys assigned to harass him. But he is resolute, and he's an intense fighter. After he does some serious damage to these guys, a superior officer comes in and points a gun to his head to stop the fighting. L is also significantly injured in the fight. In this injured state, L is taken on a stretcher and loaded onto the back of a bus. From the stretcher, he sees many people he has never seen before being forced to drink some liquid as they get on the bus. Some of the people in the bus are in pajamas, while others are in suits and a variety of other attire. They appear to have been abducted and brought here. Shortly after drinking the liquid, each person goes unconscious for the duration of the ride. The uniformed men in charge appear to have forgotten about giving L this liquid. On arrival at their unknown destination, the occupants of the bus are awoken, taken off the bus, and eventually forced to walk down a long, underground tunnel.

They are all very glad to know this, yet extremely confused with what is going on. Eventually they are marched out of the long tunnel into what appears to be an underground chamber with a checkerboard pattern on the floor. There are tied up children spaced out in rows on the pattern, each with a knife attached to their back. The people from the bus are ordered by the uniformed guards each to stand behind one child. A commander appears and orders everyone when commanded to do so to take the knife attached to the back of the child in front of them and slit their throat. He demonstrates on one of the children. Blood shoots from the gaping wound in the neck of the child, who slumps over dead. The commander then gives the command for everyone to do the same. Yet no one moves. The commander then walks up to the first person in the front row, pulls out his pistol and shoots him in the head. The man instantly falls to the ground dead. L, who is in the back row, notices guards with machine guns up in the balcony and many bullet marks on the walls. He speculates that some groups in the past may have rebelled, in which case the machine guns may have been used. Having made his point, the commander then returns to the front of the group. He says that those who do not follow his command will have the same fate as the man he just shot. He gives the command a second time, yet still no one obeys. The commander walks up to the second person in the front row and shoots him in the head. He then returns to the front and gives the command a third time. This time many in the group comply, taking the knife and slitting the throat of the child in front of them. Once the commotion dies down, the commander walks up to one of those who did not comply and shoots him in the head. He returns to the front and gives the command again.

L tries to draw only a little blood. Yet looking down, he sees pools of blood on the floor around the fallen child in front of him. He doesn't know if he actually killed the boy or not. All present are then marched out of the room. **A Severe Warning** Because L continues to state he wants out of the assassination program, he is ordered to undergo a special procedure. He is brought under guard into a room with two others. He learns that these two had stumbled across some very incriminating documents and had revealed something about them, or maybe were just thinking about doing that. In the room already are two guys who are in charge and a young girl strapped to what looks like an operating table. L and the two others are made to stand in a line watching the girl strapped down. The men in charge place a plunger tube over the fully conscious young girl's heart with a knife in it attached to a plunger. The three witnesses are instructed that if they press down on the plunger, the knife will drive deep into the girl's heart instantly killing her. They are instructed that the two in charge are going to torture the girl. Any of the three watching are free at any time to kill the girl to put her out of her misery. The two men then proceed to cut the girl's stomach open with precision medical instruments. They methodically cut out the screaming girl's organs one by one. Each time the girl goes unconscious, they apply stents to certain places inside the girl's gaping abdomen and inject her with something that forces her back to consciousness. The men appear quite well trained in how to do this. The response of the girl seems to change each time she is brought back to consciousness. It's as if she enters a more primal state of existence each time she is recovers consciousness. Her blood-curdling screams become more bizarre and intense. She eventually lets out sounds that are almost reptilian.

Finally, one of the other witnesses with L cannot bear to see the girl tortured any more and plunges the knife into the her heart to take her out of her misery. A short while afterward, L overhears the two who tortured the girl talking casually to each other, saying that it's a shame they didn't get the chance to take her all the way back to the voices that come out after the one tortured regresses far enough. The two men obviously have a lot of experience performing these procedures. L later learns that the man who finally put the girl out of her misery commits suicide about a month after this traumatizing event. L realizes that this most harrowing experience was meant as a severe warning. It was meant to show him and the other two men that these people could take and do anything they wanted with them. In L's case, he was clear that should he ever threaten to expose any of his experiences in these mind control programs, he would be subjected again to these experiences or even worse. A number of the key people L encountered in all of these programs later became prominent politicians. One of the two torturers involved in this last incident went on to become a governor. L believes this is an example of how some individuals and groups with the greatest power in our world gain complete control over those who are selected for positions of political power. Luciferian and Satanic cults are deeply involved in the implementation of these programs of torture and mind control, all as a means to further their eternal quest for more power and control. L also knows of cases where up and coming politicians were required to go through secret rituals where they had to rape, torture, and kill a young abducted girl in order to gain the seal of approval of those in power. All of this would be video recorded in a way that, should the politician ever stray from the desires of those in control, blackmail could easily be produced to bring the politician down. **Conclusion** I apologize for sharing such deep, disturbing information. But if you are like me, I'd rather know what's really going on at the deepest, darkest levels, so that we can then work to stop it.

I believe that by selectively sharing this information with those who might be able to do something about it, we can expose all of this and eventually put a stop to it. I'm fairly certain that increasing numbers are becoming informed of activities like this and doing what they can to stop it. I very much welcome any thoughts that any of you might have on what we can do. There is no way to be certain that these stories are real. Yet they are very much in line with some of the many disturbing stories I've heard from mind control survivors who I trust. Trance Formation of America by Cathy O'Brien and Mark Phillips is the best book I've seen which shows how crazy it all gets and has some very disturbing stories along these lines. If you want additional powerful information, I most highly recommend the revealing lesson on mind control we have compiled at [this link](https://www.insightcourse.net/lessons/14a_mind_control). I also invite you to remember that even those committing these atrocities have hearts. Many of them were brought up in secret societies and cults where they themselves were tortured and forced into submission at an early age. Moral feelings were driven out of them when they were young, so that they could better serve the elite who desire to control the world. Can we have compassion for what they have been through while still doing all that we can to stop the torture and destructive behavior? I don't believe all top politicians are controlled in such a severe manner, yet I do suspect that a significant percentage are. Let's do our best to energetically contact the souls of all involved in these programs and invite them to remember who they are, and to open to a greater good. And I invite us to look at our own lives, too, to see where the desire for power and control might cause us to harm or otherwise disempower people around us. We can also call in divine guidance to help us behind the scenes in transforming all of this. I very much welcome your thoughts on what we might do about these things. I believe getting the word out to the right people can make a big difference.

In the intense heat and challenging poses of these sessions, I often have powerful realizations. I think you'll enjoy the amazing inspirations I had around shadow work during today's session, which I've written up below. Much of this came as a result of pondering over the intense and disturbing experiences of the mind control insider I told you about a month or so ago in \"The Story of L\" (which is now online at [this link](https://www.WantToKnow.info/mind_control/mind_control_torture_L)). I welcome your comments and invite you to become a shadow dancer, too. Wishing you and all of us abundant love, inspiration, and joy, Fred May 17, 2010 **Bikram class May 17, 2010** Another amazing Bikram yoga session! I did a sleep fast last night, so that may have intensified this session. I went in with two intentions. One was to explore the Satanic forces in life and what I can do about this. The other was to explore more my powerful and amazing connection with Zora. And wow!!! I got some deep, rich answers to both! I saw clearly that the Satanic forces are part of a vast field of repressed energy that vibrates largely unseen beneath the surface of the energy field of the collective consciousness in our world. So many people individually have suppressed and not wanted to look at their own shadow here that it has ended up giving great power to the largely unmonitored and unchecked collective shadow of our world. This conscious denial and repression of the shadow over the centuries has caused it to become very separate and hidden from the consensus reality created by the vast majority of people on our planet. Thus all of the craziness that I and a few others have uncovered in our research. Due to this polarization of light and shadow, the shadow realms here have grown and manifested in a wide variety of strange and scary forms, from the wide variety of secret societies all the way up to Satanism where bad is good and good is bad, and all values are turned upside down. Yet still very few are even aware or want to know about all this. I was thrilled in this exploration to find that I could easily dive into this unconscious energy field and connect with the beings there. I saw that these shadow forces are merely repressed expressions of the divine which want to explore existence and to play and have fun, too. It's just that because of the way they have been cut off from the greater conscious part of the collective, their vision of play and fun has become quite distorted -- extremely distorted and at times even violently destructive.

It's just that because of the way they have been cut off from the greater conscious part of the collective, their vision of play and fun has become quite distorted -- extremely distorted and at times even violently destructive. Diving into this collective shadow during the Bikram session, I found I could establish a clear connection with all of these shadow energies and beings. As they could see that I value the shadow energies as an expression of the divine, and that I don't judge any of them individually as beings, I was welcomed into their field. I even saw how I can invite them to have more fun by playing consciously and exploring other ways of connecting which include both shadow and light. I did make clear to them my boundaries around only supporting what is best for all. I communicated that I would do my best to stop any violent or clearly destructive behavior. Yet I showed them that I very much welcomed connecting with them within these boundaries, and I was thrilled about creating new and exciting possibilities for them and for those in other realms who are beginning to awaken to expanded awareness of the value of both the light and shadow. Many of these shadow forces have consciously repressed their own light, and thus lost some of the rich spectrum available for playing and exploring in this cosmic drama. They saw how I am having so much fun playing full out in the realms of both light and shadow and were interested in learning how to do that. I communicated to them that I suspected they were somehow a polarized reflection of the repressed side of the people they hated, and vice versa. The old paradigm polarization of light and shadow is gradually shifting as increasing numbers of people on our planet open both to the personal and to the collective shadow. When we both individually and collectively welcome the shadow as a long lost friend and potent teacher, it becomes less distorted and separate from the collective consciousness of this world. The shadow is now increasingly integrating with the light in a beautiful dance. I want to invite all who are interested to join in the fun and meaningful explorations available when we have the courage to learn to dance with the shadows both within ourselves and in the collective. I then saw an amazing connection with Zora in all of this. Zora is a shadow dancer. In the last two years, she has been willing to dive deep into her own shadows -- particularly in her intense journey work with mushrooms -- and come out shining", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:insider__10_shadow_and_light_dance.txt:1:5082d1e0a076", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 11530, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "insider__10_shadow_and_light_dance.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "insider__10_shadow_and_light_dance", "chunk_index": 2, "text": "invite all who are interested to join in the fun and meaningful explorations available when we have the courage to learn to dance with the shadows both within ourselves and in the collective.

She is much less afraid of and more comfortable with the shadow realms than most people. I sense that she and I can be powerful shadow dancers inviting people to see the power and joy of dancing with the shadows, and also inviting the shadow energies to dance, to play, and to transform with us. As we gradually integrate the many different aspects of ourselves, we can invite ever growing numbers of people to join in the incredibly rich dance of shadow and light. Wild stuff!!!

And Where Does Consciousness Come From?** Hey wonderful 'In the Know' friends, First, a special welcome to the several dozen new members of our list, all of whom are major supporters of PEERS. It's a pleasure and an honor to be able to share with you both the exciting inspirational material I receive and some of what I have been finding in my research deep into the shadows of our world and into other dimensions and realities. First, I want to recommend an excellent link inviting all interested to join in calling for elections results which support the highest good for all in the upcoming US elections. Here's the link: [http://www.visionarylead.org/E-newsletter/42.html](http://www.visionarylead.org/E-newsletter/42.html). And for an intriguing one-minute BBC commercial on the power of the Internet hinting at ET presence, [click here](https://www.personalgrowthcourses.net/video/power_of_the_internet). If you want to learn about two amazing individuals who have explored deep into both the realms of shadow and light, I encourage you to learn about careful researcher Graham Hancock ([http://www.grahamhancock.com/biog.htm](http://www.grahamhancock.com/biog.htm) and especially his interview with David Wilcock [available here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvNEVvHgOOY)) and wild comedian Bill Hicks who spoke truth to power, yet died very young ([http://www.billhicks.com](http://www.billhicks.com/)). Lots of rich and inspiring material there. Every other month I do one or two days of silence and fasting. It's often a rich and inspiring time for me to evaluate what I'm doing in my life and explore deeper into how best I can serve all beings and support both personal and global transformation. During my two days of silence about 10 days ago, I had some incredibly deep and rich explorations. These explorations led to the message below and to the title of this email, \"Who created God? Where does consciousness come from?\" So who created God? In times of inquisition like that of [800 years ago in Europe](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inquisition#Medieval_Inquisition), this question alone could easily have gotten me killed or at least sent to the torture chambers by the powers that be of the time -- the Catholic Church. Yet for me today, it is a legitimate and very deep question. Of course the term God has been used in many different ways and means different things to different people. Because of this ambiguity, I generally avoid the term and prefer either the words Spirit, the Divine, or -- what I feel is the best descriptor of what these words are trying to convey -- \"All That Is.\" So to reframe the question in my own words, who created All That Is? Now if a person's answer to this is God, then I again ask \"Who created God?\" Even if a person doesn't believe in God or any kind of divine being, the question remains, why does anything exist? Where does consciousness come from? Why not just nothingness? This is the ultimate existential question. To me, it is also sometimes a scary thought. Yet I have found", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:insider__10_who_created_god.txt:0:f2ed110be122", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 11532, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "insider__10_who_created_god.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "insider__10_who_created_god", "chunk_index": 1, "text": "Is.\" So to reframe the question in my own words, who created All That Is?

Where does consciousness come from? Why not just nothingness? This is the ultimate existential question. To me, it is also sometimes a scary thought. Yet I have found that often fear is invitation to growth. Only by facing my own fears have I been able to dive so deep into all that I explore. By looking into even the possibility of ultimate nothingness and meaninglessness, I am choosing to face some of my own deepest fears. My current answer to these deep questions about who created God or who created All That Is, and why not nothingness, is simply I don't know. In fact I have not the faintest idea or speculation on this most core question of existence. To me this is the ultimate mystery, the deepest part of the divine mystery. I suspect I will never be able to find an answer in this lifetime, and it may ultimately be a question that is unanswerable by anyone -- even the collective consciousness of us all. So now that I have created the ultimate blasphemy by questioning even God's origin, where do I continue this line of inquiry? The next natural step seems to me to be to acknowledge that my consciousness exists, and so does yours and that of every conscious being in the universe. Somehow, though I have not the slightest idea how, you, me, and all conscious beings who share this universe came to exist. Or maybe we have always existed and time is just an illusion. I don't know. I've heard some speculate that we all started as one unitary consciousness which eventually split itself into a vast myriad of consciousnesses to explore itself. But if this is the case, we are back to the who created God question. Where did that one unitary consciousness come from? And what existed before that? How could one unitary consciousness even divide itself? By the way, if any of you have reasonable answers to these questions, I would love to hear and consider them. I have no answer and just take it as a given that I exist and we all exist here, otherwise how could I be typing this message and you be reading it? Even if it is, as some say, all an illusion, well then the illusion is all I have to work with. I do suspect that even though I have no idea where it came from, there is and always has been some form of greater consciousness, some integrated collective consciousness of All That Is. I suspect that somehow this consciousness", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:insider__10_who_created_god.txt:1:cf57f82ffbf3", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 11533, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "insider__10_who_created_god.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "insider__10_who_created_god", "chunk_index": 2, "text": "I exist and we all exist here, otherwise how could I be typing this message and you be reading it?

I do suspect that even though I have no idea where it came from, there is and always has been some form of greater consciousness, some integrated collective consciousness of All That Is. I suspect that somehow this consciousness fragmented in order to explore itself, quite possibly because being the only thing that existed unto itself was in some way boring. And some or all of these fragments then fragmented themselves into other conscious entities. Thus were eventually born all of the consciousnesses in the universe. I am not at all sure of this, but right now it is what makes most sense to me. Yet somehow, even after this unitary consciousness fragmented itself, I suspect that there continued/continues to be a more expanded collective awareness of all of the fragments, a kind of divine collective consciousness of all beings. And using the [holographic model](https://www.transformationteam.net/ttcourse/trfc20b), within each of the fragments the whole is contained. So within each of our consciousnesses, we have access to the more expanded awareness of All That Is. One of the things that complicates all of this is that I am fairly certain that there are dimensions of existence in which time does not exist in any sort of linear sense. So maybe trying to explore all of this using a time-based model of cause and effect is simply a futile effort of a very limited consciousness (me), trying to comprehend things in other realms that are simply incomprehensible from the limited viewpoint of a human being. Again, I don't know, but that doesn't stop me from exploring the possibilities. I am sharing here my deepest musings into life and existence. I am aware that these musings may or may not have any practical use in your life. But in my current sojourn as a human on planet Earth, I continue to find this investigation most rich and intriguing. Continuing with this speculative line of inquiry, the original unitary consciousness might have first split itself into two (yin and yang), then into four, eight, 16, 32, etc., creating some kind of sacred geometry based in what we understand as mathematics. Or it might have been much more random (like chaos theory). On the other hand, it might have been a kind of spiritual big bang when the One suddenly exploded into a myriad of fragmented beings. I suspect if there ever was only one unitary consciousness, it likely fragmented through some combination of all of the processes - divine geometry, random divisions, and occasional explosive fragmentation. The posited original source consciousness may have first started with just a split from one unitary consciousness into two", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:insider__10_who_created_god.txt:2:32e2a93cf3b0", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 11534, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "insider__10_who_created_god.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "insider__10_who_created_god", "chunk_index": 3, "text": "much more random (like chaos theory).

I suspect if there ever was only one unitary consciousness, it likely fragmented through some combination of all of the processes - divine geometry, random divisions, and occasional explosive fragmentation. The posited original source consciousness may have first started with just a split from one unitary consciousness into two individuated ones. This would have created an opposition, a polarization whose ramifications can still be seen in our world today. The masculine/feminine light/shadow yin/yang split which can be seen in many aspects of existence are clear examples. Yet even if this was the case, the original split was only a beginning. Among humans, some people seem to focus on the polarities they see in life (good vs bad/evil), which could have originated in this original split. Yet there is clearly much more. In our current reality there are countless examples of rainbow spectrums where the ends are only the most extreme poles of an entire, rich spectrum. Between black and white are an infinite variety of colors. Between the pure masculine and pure feminine energies are a vast multitude of mixes of both. And in the many and vast spectrums of existence, the extremes seem to almost always be shadow images of each other. Black and white are more like each other than all of the other intermediate colors. They are inverse shadows of each other, one representing complete fullness, the other complete emptiness. The choice to focus on polarized extremes shows up in our reality as black and white thinking, which plays an important role in our world. It may even play a key role in expanded realities going back to the posited original split, though I acknowledge all of this is highly speculative. Yet the fact is that many in this world tend to see things in polarized terms of black and white, good and bad. It makes it easier for them to maneuver through an already very complex and sometimes overwhelming life. Generally these people tend to be afraid of their own shadow. What I mean is that they do their best to destroy, banish, or suppress that which is considered bad or not light, i.e. what many call the shadow, both within and outside of themselves. Yet I think everyone on this list would agree that on the deepest or most expanded levels, all beings are somehow interconnected. And to try to banish or destroy something to which you are always interconnected is on some level an attempt to banish or destroy a part of oneself.

If you don't have time for the whole course, I most highly recommend what I feel are the most powerful two lessons, 3 and 20. Here are the links for those interested: [https://www.transformationteam.net/ttcourse/ttcourse03a](https://www.transformationteam.net/ttcourse/ttcourse03a) - Taking Responsibility for Our Lives [https://www.transformationteam.net/ttcourse/trfc20a](https://www.transformationteam.net/ttcourse/trfc20a) - Beyond Duality So what I'm finding is that the desire to see things in terms of duality and the accompanying desire to destroy or suppress the shadow are at the root of a lot of unconscious behavior we see manifesting in our world. This may even be at the root of all suffering. If we shift from a polarized worldview to a focus more on the interconnectedness of all beings, if we recognize and honor the full rainbow spectrum of existence and do our best to see the core divine essence in all, it seems only natural to me that suffering would dramatically decrease and love and joy would increase. What say you? No matter how consciousness came to be, the fact is that there are gazillions of consciousnesses which now exist in the universe. And these consciousnesses come together in a huge variety of ways to form groups which interact with each other and with the world around them. Humanity and the vast numbers of groups humans form on this world would be but one small example. Ants and mosquitoes would be another. I sense that each of these groups, whether human, animal, or otherwise, have their own collective consciousness. Yet they also have their own level of collective unconsciousness. The unconscious aspect is the collective of all parts about which the group on some level denies or suppresses. It is the collective shadow, which likely has some sort of mind of its own and causes all sorts of problems, or -- looked at in another way -- creates all sorts of opportunities for growth. I have found it is when I consciously choose to bring the unconscious material to the", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:insider__10_who_created_god.txt:4:30c07c7b08ef", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 11536, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "insider__10_who_created_god.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "insider__10_who_created_god", "chunk_index": 5, "text": "they also have their own level of collective unconsciousness.

I have found it is when I consciously choose to bring the unconscious material to the light that my life and the world around me is transformed. When we both individually and collectively choose to open to our shadows and even learn to dance with them, life can become much more rich and meaningful. This, by the way, is the underlying thesis of the transformation course, along with love being the transformative force which interconnects us all. Sacred love is the ultimate force of harmonious integration. So the divine may have have exploded all at once, or it may have split itself into myriad fragments in a more gradual process, and that process is likely ongoing in some way that I am not clear. This grand process of separation is not necessarily a bad thing. There is a time for both separation and integration. A wife subject to continual physical abuse from her husband would likely do best to separate from him. I suspect that even now consciousness continues to divide itself in order to explore ever deeper into the divine mystery of life and existence. Yet at the same time, consciousness appears to be in a process of integration. Some believe that this integration will eventually lead us back into being one united being. I hear many people these days saying \"we are all one.\" Yet even if we were all eventually to come back together into one unitary being, what would be the purpose of it all? Just to start the whole process all over again? Clearly there is some sort of reintegration process happening, and I very much support and encourage this. Yet I would hope that even as we integrate, each fragment continues to maintain the unique perspective it has gained, which can be shared with the collective of all beings. So rather than saying we are all one, I prefer to say that we are all interconnected in a beautiful, divine dance with the cosmos. And even as we all reintegrate the various aspects of consciousness into a more aware collective consciousness, we can also retain the beautiful individuality that each of us embodies. Though I highly suspect there is some kind of unitary collective consciousness that lies within all of us, I know also that my individuated consciousness which is typing these words here is not that unitary consciousness. I and all beings may have access to that collective consciousness, but I am not the One.

I and all beings may have access to that collective consciousness, but I am not the One. And I suspect you aren't either. So I don't want you to bow down to me, and I won't bow down to you either. Yet I will most certain love and honor you as the divine manifestation that you are. And I want to learn to dance better with you and with all beings. So I'm finding that though I understand people's intention in saying \"we are all one\" as a means of honoring the existence of a unitary collective consciousness that lies within every being, in practical life, you and I are not one. You are there, and I am here. This is what gives life it's richness. If we all were truly one, I do suspect it might be boring. As you are there and I am here, we get to explore each other, to inspire each other, to share the unique piece of divine manifestation that each of us are, even here on planet Earth! That is exactly what I am doing here right now as this divine manifestation called Fred sharing my own particular thoughts on life and existence with you. By the way, I am hoping before long to get started on a new website focused on explorations into the divine mystery, which will eventually be available at [www.divinemystery.net](http://www.divinemystery.net/). All of the other PEERS websites take as a starting point our current world and its reality, and invite people to see in more expanded ways all of both the disturbing and inspiring things going on in our world -- the shadow and the light. They start with the fragmented world in which we live and invite greater awareness and integration of all aspects of live and existence. In contrast, the divine mystery website will have a starting point of the great divine mystery of existence and the interconnectedness of all of us on the deepest or most expanded levels of existence. From that mystical viewpoint, the website will explore and build a bridge from these mystical realities back to the practicalities of our everyday life here on Earth. I very much look forward to creating this website. If you've actually read this far, I want to thank you for sharing in my musings and explorations into consciousness.

Great stuff! I'm a bit more optimistic than these two, but then I'm not nearly as empathic as Inelia. Take care, and enjoy these transformative times. Wishing you and all of us abundant love, inspiration, and joy, Fred June 20, 2012 **Bill Ryan: The Cry of Gaia - A Call to Action** Inelia Benz gives Bill Ryan a direct experience of Gaia. Bill comes to understand the extent of Inelia's experience of the pain of the whole planet. Most readers will know that Gaia is most often associated with the term coined by the ecologist James Lovelock to describe the coherent, complex, balanced, living entity of Planet Earth in all its natural richness. I (Bill) had always taken this as a metaphor - until I met Inelia. And so I tell this little story which follows against myself. To Inelia, it was self-evident that Gaia was a magnificent, fully sentient, godlike being. And when talking about this with me, she did what she often does when words are inadequate: she invited me to take her hands while she gave me a download of direct perception. This she did: and I immediately perceived Gaia, a huge, eon-ancient entity that is our planet and all her multitudinous natural habitats. It was enormous, and strong, and solid, and eternal. I could feel her power. It was something literally awesome. I shall never forget that moment of first encounter. No doubt exists for me now about Gaia's conscious reality. Gaia talks to Inelia all the time. And last month, when in Switzerland, I was inspired to ask for a direct communication. Staying for weeks in a small hotel room waiting for my US visa to be issued, I decided to take an afternoon out to climb a mountain. I used to climb a lot of mountains, but this time I took the mountain railway to the summit. I'd been cooped up for weeks, and I expanded my awareness in gratitude and appreciation at the marvelous natural environment of rocks, trees and alpine meadows which we were passing through on the train. I am a mountain man to my roots, and I deeply love this kind of terrain. Near the summit, the mist swirled around me as I climbed the rocks to the very top. And suddenly, feeling connected with Gaia, I had a wild thought. I said to myself, as if in prayer: \"Gaia, if you can hear me, show me a Brocken Specter.\" Now, a Brocken Specter is a spectacular natural phenomenon which requires a precisely coordinated combination of sun, clouds, atmospherics and moisture.

It consists of a huge shadow of oneself projected on the clouds below, surrounded by a rainbow halo. They're very rare: in all my time in the mountains, years and countless expeditions all over the world, I have seen only a handful of Brocken Specters. And suddenly, within maybe a minute and a half, one suddenly appeared. There it was. I spent half an hour filming it, in various stages of awe and disbelief. I was staggered. As in the movie Avatar, I found myself thinking: \"Eywa has heard me.\" That was over a month ago, in Europe. And now, we cut to today, in Sacramento, California. I had not seen Inelia for a couple of days, and she came round to see me towards the end of a very busy afternoon. It was wonderful to see her, as always. And as I gave her a hug, she collapsed in tears in my arms. I looked at her, and held her hands, not knowing what was the matter. She looked back at me, eyes brimming. \"I can hear the cry\", she said. \"It's getting louder. I can't bear it. It's overwhelming.\" I looked at her intently, realizing. \"The cry of the collective, and Gaia\", she said. \"All the people, animals, all the plants, all the trees. There's so much pain, so much suffering, so much violence. I feel it all. I hear it all. Every minute of every day. It never stops. I can't stand it. And it's getting louder all the time.\" She looked at me, asking me to understand. And I did. Like many humans, I'm a hypocrite: that means that I compartmentalize my experience for convenience. I wear a leather hat, and eat as much meat as I can. But I cannot bring myself to kill even a mosquito. I genuinely regard all living things as sacred. I have a dictum that I must never destroy anything I can't create - which is why I save mosquitoes. Yet I deny my participation as a cavalier consumer. Meanwhile, Inelia was directly experiencing the pain of Gaia. Through tears of compassion, she talked of the blind unawareness of the men in the slaughterhouses, the chemical farmers, the factory fishermen, the destroyers of the rainforests, the creators of wars.

Deeply moved, and in response, I read to her the opening paragraph of Thom Hartmann's masterwork, The Last Hours of Ancient Sunlight: In the 24 hours since this time yesterday, over 200,000 acres of rainforest have been destroyed in our world. Fully 13 million tons of toxic chemicals have been released into our environment. Over 45,000 people have died of starvation, 38,000 of them children. And more than 130 plant or animal species have been driven to extinction by the actions of humans. (The last time there was such a rapid loss of species was when the dinosaurs vanished.) And all this just since yesterday. I was brought up in Africa. I've spent my life exploring wild places. Inelia has deep connections with sacred land in her native Chile, and a few years ago was brave enough to sail round Cape Horn in a small boat. When she was a little girl, she would pick hummingbirds off the branches of trees, and they would let her hold them in her tiny hands. They knew who she was; and they knew that they would not be harmed. Still through her tears of Gaia's suffering, Inelia told me a story about violence and anger. Years ago, she had a German Shepherd, which had caught its paw in a metal gate. The dog was beside itself with anger and pain. Its head whipped backwards and forwards, snapping at anyone who tried to get near as it struggled to free itself. Inelia walked up to it and held him firmly, but to get to his paw she had to put her arm between his jaws and the gate. In its pain it sank its teeth into her arm - which Inelia permitted it to do. Then after the paw was free, Inelia held the dog's jaws tight, as he continued trying to bite. She held him against the ground firmly but gently. It calmed down and she was able to release it, knowing it would no longer bite those around him. The wound in her arm healed without scars. The moral of the story? Humans, too, lash out in anger and violence, because they are in great pain and fear. \"I'd like to hold them all in my arms\", said Inelia. \"All of", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:insider__11_bill_ryan_inelia_benz_messages.txt:2:aee00539a86f", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 11542, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "insider__11_bill_ryan_inelia_benz_messages.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "insider__11_bill_ryan_inelia_benz_messages", "chunk_index": 3, "text": "the dog's jaws tight, as he continued trying to bite.

The moral of the story? Humans, too, lash out in anger and violence, because they are in great pain and fear. \"I'd like to hold them all in my arms\", said Inelia. \"All of them. I'd like to show them that they are loved, and that they are safe. All the murderers, all the rapists, all the butchers of the seals, whales and dolphins, all the bloodthirsty workers in the abattoirs, the creators of wars.\" I listened to Inelia stating clearly through her tears that all violent men needed was love, safety and compassion. I suggested, attempting to reassure, that what she stated so eloquently in her video interview was sufficient: \"I only have one job. And that's to raise the vibrational level of the planet, including the human collective, which is part of the planet, to a critical point that will allow a transition into the new paradigm, a new level of awareness for everything. For the planet and every being in it. Every rock, every insect, every person. And that's my only job. And I will do anything to achieve that.\" Meaning: that if we raise the level of awareness of what Inelia calls the 'collective' - the group-mind and collective consciousness of the human race - then the murderers, rapists, polluters and destroyers will all be dragged along in the same collective direction - they HAVE to swim in the same rushing, accelerating river as the rest of us. In that way we are all connected... and with some of us leading the way, the rest will follow: even those humans with the morals and awareness of crocodiles. But to Inelia, this was not enough. How to maximize the effect? How to reach those unreachable people? How to halt the pain and damage as soon as possible? How to educate the uneducable? How to release THEIR paw from the metal gate? Lovingly stop THEM from biting, and removing all gates where their paws might get caught? Who will read these words we're writing here? Not the killers and destroyers. We're surely preaching to the converted: having read thus far, you're almost certain to be in strong agreement. My own answer is as follows. Rupert Sheldrake brought us the concept of Morphic Fields and Morphic Resonance. Lynne McTaggart described 'The Field' in her best-selling book of the same name.

We have an intuitive understanding of the Hundred Monkey syndrome, and of Tipping Points in general. My personal strong feeling is we have to assume that, like blowing up an airbed (gradually, with an inefficient handpump), some corners of the mattress will inflate before others. When doing this, it almost always seems that nothing is ever going to happen - until a tipping point is reached and the rapidly inflating mattress all suddenly picks up and takes the desired shape as if by magic. I think we're in that kind of position now. The mattress doesn't yet look like a mattress, and it seems as if it's never going to inflate. We might think it looks hopeless. But soon - I do believe - things may start to feel different. I want to say a word about 'Ascension' - and how the word is often misunderstood and misapplied. Some people really do think that they will literally 'ascend' out of here - as in some kind of 'beam-me-up' 'rapture' or rescue, possibly at the hands of helpful ETs or angelic beings. In my strong view, this is escapist wishful thinking. Any kind of get-me-outta-here-Scotty mindset is actually failing to take responsibility - certainly for those of us who have been here many lifetimes and who have in one way or another contributed to the mess we're in. Many of us reading this have been here on Planet Earth for quite a while - and we have to face what we have done: we have to square up to what we've permitted to occur in our name. If we're here to fix all this - which it's very clear to me that we are - then we HAVE TO face what we've done. There's no easy escape, and certainly no rescue. Rather, there's a massive clean-up job waiting for people, tools, resources and organization to get started on... together. It may take several generations. Maybe many generations. But it's do-able. Not just to repair the damage, but to educate the human race in understanding finally that we must live in balance and harmony with Gaia - or else we merely imperil ourselves. (Gaia will always be all right. She's been around for several billion years, and is probably only half way through her lifespan as the Guardian-Goddess of this exquisitely beautiful planet.) But there's the real risk - for us, not for her - that if we do not learn the lessons that are for the taking, right here in front of our noses (and our wallets) - we may flunk the class and be destroyed. It could all happen terribly easily.

It could all happen terribly easily. And the choice is ours: collectively ours. In my personal view, this is one of the key significances of the 2012 Tipping Point. 21 December 2012 is a distraction. The real significance of the year (certainly not one standalone day in that year) is that if we as the collective human race make the right choices, it will not be too late to re-create the balanced dynamic paradise that Planet Earth could be for all living things - and for mankind itself. And if we make the wrong choices, our children may have a very rough time of it indeed. They would rightly blame their parents for not doing what they could when they had all the information available to them. So guess what: it's all about Free Will. Should we be surprised that the equation distills down to this again? Here are Inelia's own words in conclusion: It is not about who's to blame. The solution has to be inclusive. Yes, we take responsibility in minimizing the pain and suffering of others through our actions. We eat meat from small farms, organic producers who love their animals. Yes, we buy furniture from renewable sources of wood, clothes from factories which don't exploit people. But what of the perpetrators of fear and pain? We might hold them in our field of light, and allow Gaia to do her work. As a 'singularity' - I am but one person. But WE are many. If we dedicate 10 minutes a day to holding these people in our collective light, it can make a huge shift for them and us. After the 10 minutes, let us focus on the compassion and love of the millions of lightworkers and lightwarriors around the planet, our brethren, so that our collective power increases - making each one of us more able to accomplish our collective work. I also feel the love, light and compassion of billions of people around the world. All those parents who hold their new born baby in wonderment and deep love, all those who behold our Mother Earth in awe as they sense Her power and compassion.

Many of you know about Bill Ryan of Project Camelot and Project Avalon. If you don't, you might do a search those terms. You will likely appreciate the rich amount of highly informative material on some very deep topics available on these websites. I've had a few short conversations with Bill in person and greatly admire his transformational work. He has recently posted a most inspiring video interview with a woman named Inelia Benz. He says it is the most important interview he has done yet.\n\nInelia claims that she came here directly from some expanded realms beyond time and space to fulfill a mission of basically restoring free will and balance to this planet. She claims she is one of millions who are now here consciously helping to restore this balance. And she is refreshingly optimistic about all that is happening and the future of our planet.\n\nYou might want skip the beginning, which is a bit slow, and start at minute 54 to get a sense for the quality of information she is sharing.

He died two days ago of cancer at age 70, after having been diagnosed only six days earlier. He was a top proponent of the new energy movement and one of the calmest, warmest, most grounded voices for transformation around. You can see his website at [http://www.brianoleary.info](http://www.brianoleary.info) and bio at [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_O%27Leary](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_O%27Leary). We will miss him dearly, yet we can also now call on his great spirit to provide guidance in these wild and transformational times. And for some inspiration, I'll mention that every other month I have been doing one or two days of silence and fasting for many years. I find these days to be most rich and inspiring in helping me to keep focused on what I want to be doing in my life, and in exploring how I can live with ever greater love and integrity. I thought I would share with you here some rich realizations from a day of silence I enjoyed just last month. \"I am both creating and being created in every moment. Clear intentions empower me to be an active, potent creator. Willingness to surrender to what's best for all - never knowing what that is - allows me to accept and appreciate all that is created in my life. How I interpret what happens makes all the difference in my experience of life. \"By accepting all in my life exactly as it is, I leave my victim ways behind to step fully into my co-creative role with the universe. As I acknowledge and work with the shadow sides of both myself and the world around me, I invite ever greater transformation to unfold through integrating the light and the shadows. By continuously choosing love, support, and meaningful connection with myself and all around me, I play an active role in creating a slice of the paradise we are all ever more consciously manifesting.\" Thanks for sharing in the inspiration, and for playing your part in the global transformation which is rapidly unfolding all around us. Take care, and have a most beautiful and meaningful month of August ahead.

I've included below a fascinating part of my 2010 summary on realizations that came to me during a couple of my monthly Bikram yoga sessions. I share these not in any way to try to convince or persuade you of anything, but rather simply as food for thought for those who might be interested. If it doesn't resonate for you, just skip it. You take care and have a most beautiful and meaningful day and new month ahead. Wishing you and all of us abundant love, inspiration, and joy, Fred January 31, 2011 **Note:** I got into yoga in 2003, when my back was a mess. I was in almost constant lower back pain back then. One of my housemates told me that Bikram yoga was very good for healing back pain. Within a month of starting this practice daily, my back was 50% better. Within three months, it was as strong as ever! Amazing!!! I am deeply grateful to this yoga practice for healing my back pain of many years. It has also led to many powerful realizations, as you will see below. **Bikram Yoga** I continue to love my monthly Bikram yoga sessions. I had lots of great inspirations and ended up writing the beautiful \"Spiritual Eyes\" essay as a direct result of inspirations during one of these 90-minute sessions of intense 105-degree heat. I go in with a clear intention every time and invariably get some rich, and sometimes unexpected realizations as a result of this intention. **April 27 Bikram class: **The chosen one. So many people are looking for the chosen one to save them, whether it be Christ, the Messiah, the knight in shining armor, or ETs coming to rescue us. They are ready to surrender their power to this chosen one who will then lead them out of their troubles and into the promised land. In surrendering to the chosen one, they then no longer have to take personal responsibility for their lives, as the chosen one takes on the responsibility and shows them the way. They have only to follow what the chosen one tells them to do. At the same time, many of us have a part within that believes in some way that we are the chosen one. We have the all answers. And if only others would follow us, our lives and world would be saved. Yet when confronted with the possibility of stepping into positions of great power, the fear of shouldering all that responsibility for others can be daunting.

And the fear of somehow misusing that power, as so often happens, causes many to shrink from taking on greater power. I know the desire to both follow a chosen one and to be the chosen one are alive in me. And yet what I know on a deeper level is that I am the chosen one. Every one of us is the chosen one! When we open to the amazing process of co-creating our world with all around us, every one of us is special and chosen. Every one of us is a powerful creator and a unique aspect of the divine exploring itself through us. On the deeper levels, I know it's not about giving up or taking power and responsibility. It's about simply being in the sacred flow of life and dancing with the divine in ever more expanded ways. Some people are clearly more talented and gifted than others in certain abilities. I know that I have both been given and developed amazing talents and wisdom over the years. In particular, I am able to see and experience the interconnectedness of all of us much more than most. It is very easy for me to see the divine in everyone and every thing. I am also rare on this planet in my unwavering commitment to what's best for all. Yet this does not make me any better than anyone else, though it does seem to allow me to play a bigger role than most people here are playing. **May 17 Bikram class:** I went in with two intentions. One was to explore the Satanic forces in life and what I can do about this. The other was to explore more my powerful and amazing connection with Zora. And wow!!! I got some deep, rich answers to both! I saw clearly that the Satanic forces are a manifestation of a vast field of repressed energy that vibrates largely unseen beneath the surface of the energy field of the collective consciousness in our world. So many people have avoided and suppressed their own shadow here that it has ended up giving great power to the largely unmonitored and unchecked collective shadow of our world. This conscious denial and repression of the shadow over the centuries has caused it to become very separate and hidden from the consensus reality created by the vast majority of people on our planet.

This conscious denial and repression of the shadow over the centuries has caused it to become very separate and hidden from the consensus reality created by the vast majority of people on our planet. This has allowed all sorts of twisted negativity to develop and fester, which is the force behind most of the craziness that I and others have uncovered in our research. Due to this polarization of light and shadow, the shadow realms here have grown and manifested in a wide variety of strange and scary forms, from government mind control programs to the many and varied secret societies, and even to Satanism where all values are turned upside down: bad is good and good is bad. Yet very few are aware or even want to know or talk about any of this. I was thrilled in this exploration to find that I could easily dive into this unconscious energy field and connect with the beings there. I saw that these shadow forces are merely repressed expressions of the divine which want to explore existence and to play and have fun, too. It's just that because of the way they have been cut off from the greater conscious part of the collective, their vision of play and fun has become quite distorted - extremely distorted, even, and at times violently destructive. Diving into this collective shadow during the Bikram session, I found I could establish a clear connection with these shadow energies and beings. As they could see that I value the shadow energies as an expression of the divine, and that I don't judge any of them individually as beings, I was welcomed into their field. I even saw how I can invite them to have more fun by playing consciously and exploring other ways of connecting which include both shadow and light. I was careful to make clear to them my boundaries around supporting only what's best for all. I communicated that I would do my best to stop any violent or clearly destructive behavior. Yet I showed them that I very much welcomed connecting with them within these boundaries, and I was thrilled about creating new and exciting possibilities for them and for those in other realms who are beginning to awaken to expanded awareness of the value of both the light and shadow. Just as the light forces repressed their own shadow, many of these shadow forces have consciously repressed their own light.

The shadow forces with which I connected saw how I am having lots of fun playing full out in the realms of both light and shadow and were interested in learning how to do that. I communicated to them that I suspected they were somehow a polarized reflection of the repressed side of the people they despised, and vice versa. The old paradigm polarization of light and shadow is gradually shifting as increasing numbers of people on our planet open both to the personal and to the collective shadow. When we both individually and collectively welcome the shadow as a long lost friend and potent teacher, it becomes less distorted and separate from the collective consciousness of this world. The shadow is now increasingly integrating with the light in a beautiful dance. I want to invite all who are interested to join in the fun and meaningful explorations available when we have the courage to learn to dance with both the light and the shadows within ourselves as individuals, and within the collective of which we are a part. I then saw an amazing connection with Zora in all of this. Zora is a shadow dancer. In the pursuit of her own healing, she has been willing to dive deep into her own shadows - particularly in her intense journey work with mushrooms - and come out shining and vibrating in an exciting new and transformed state. She is much more willing to look into and explore the shadow realms than most people. I sense that she and I can be powerful shadow dancers inviting people to see the power and joy of dancing with both the light and the shadows, and also inviting the light and shadow energies to dance, to play, and to transform with us.

Continued growth and a few major shifts have been the hallmark of this last year for me. Both the growth and the shifts of 2011 have shown up in several areas of my life. In my work life, the [PEERS empowerment websites](https://www.peerservice.org/) I founded continue to grow, thrive, and have a significant impact in our world. Compared to last year, the total number of visits to our 12 websites increased by over 35%. We had 4.6 million page views for the year (12,000/day), and our [two email lists](https://www.peerservice.org/subscribe_peers) grew to over 12,000 subscribers from 140 countries. And as a big shift, after seven years of volunteering full time for PEERS (during which I donated over $25,000 of my own limited resources), I earned enough this year ($2,000/month) to support myself with this work. Yea!!! I am extremely thankful to the many hundreds of people (including many of you) who generously donate to support our work. As the executive director of PEERS, I receive many warm emails expressing deep gratitude both for spreading vital information about what is going on behind the scenes in our world, and for the many ways we inspire people to help powerfully [shift the paradigm](https://www.WantToKnow.info/070707newparadigm) on both personal and global levels towards ever more love, healing, and empowerment. And almost all who complete one of our [free online courses](https://www.personalgrowthcourses.net/) continue to give [rave reviews](https://www.transformationteam.net/appreciations) and find the courses life transforming. *I just wanted to thank you for the brilliant work you're doing.

I live in Finland and have been searching for something like this for many years.* ~~ Emil, April 19, 2011 In my relationship life, one intense moment of overwhelm in July caused Zora, my wonderful sweetheart of a year and a half, to suddenly and unexpectedly break off our relationship, largely because she felt she couldn't handle the intense emotions that challenges of open relationship brought up for her. After moving through all of the pain, anger, and sadness that came out of the break up, we thankfully have gone on to establish a friendship that we both enjoy. I love the friendship I have with almost all my former lovers. Marjorie and I even enjoyed an adventure-filled trip to China together this year. It has changed tremendously since I lived there 27 years ago. In my community life, I am thrilled that at our 10-day [NFNC Summer Camp](http://www.nfnc.org/) with over 100 pioneering souls in a beautiful southern Oregon valley, every year we go deeper into healing, personal growth, and loving community connection. I also enjoy a few inspiring groups which have grown out of that. And with my flowing dance community, my loving Sacred Connections friends, and several other inspiring communities large and small in which I'm involved, I continue to be most thankful for the wonderful, loving friends and community all around me. In my research life, I've learned a lot more about a pervasive [network of secret societies](https://www.WantToKnow.info/secretsocietiesnewsarticles) which have infiltrated governments and key institutions around the world. With their obsession for control and secrecy, I am convinced that this powerful network has been a key source of a huge amount of war, suffering, and manipulation on this planet. That said, this [secretive network](https://www.WantToKnow.info/secret_societies/svali) has many competing factions which sometimes battle each other for power and control. While some power-hungry factions are pushing for a third world war and armageddon scenario, thankfully others care about our planet and are working for the betterment of our world. And I know all of this is a reflection of what is going on inside of us both individually and collectively. And going even deeper, profound information from a member of one of the most powerful secret societies who calls himself \"[Hidden Hand](https://www.WantToKnow.info/secret_societies/hidden_hand_bloodlines)\" has convinced me that much of the negativity here is part of a greater plan to give humanity the kick in the butt it needed to focus more on spiritual growth. Yet it's all shifting rapidly now. It appears that key underground bases developed by the armageddon faction of the secret societies [were destroyed](http://divinecosmos.com/index.php) this year.

This is but one example of many that behind the scenes, major transformative changes are well under way in our world. In my spiritual life, I so love opening to ever more love and connection in my life on all levels. I've particularly enjoyed this year exploring the expansive, loving place beyond the veil, where time and space as we know it do not exist. Using breathwork, Bikram yoga, dream time, and sacred medicines, my main focus has been on how to bridge that sacred dimension of flowing love and light with the normal three-dimensional, five-sensory reality in which we live. Diving into the Hidden Hand and [Law of One materials](http://www.llresearch.org/) has also beautifully linked my Internet research and these spiritual explorations. I'm most thankful for many great realizations around all of this. Though not as rich and profound as some other years, I'm very thankful that 2011 has helped me to grow and shift in inspiring ways and brought me plenty of rich, challenging, and meaningful experiences. My life is very blessed with loving friends, community, and so much more. Thank you so much for being a wonderful supporter of me and my work in whatever ways you do that. May this new year be filled with lots of love, rich connections, and growth for you and for all of us. I think it's going to be a great one!

I found certain parts of the material to be incredibly profound. At 60 pages of material, though, a lot of people on the list didn't have time to go through it, especially as some of the material was weak and even included some fear mongering. Well, I finally found time to pull the incredible gems out of this material into a 16-page summary which I feel is dynamite! I felt transformed even in the process of putting this summary together. Truly mind-boggling ideas with very practical applications! The Hidden Hand material is one of two fascinating essays which have had a far greater impact than any other writings I've found on my understanding of the big picture of life, our world, and the universe. The second essay is the WingMakers material, which most of you know about and is [available here](https://www.WantToKnow.info/consciousnessparadigms). The Hidden Hand material has by far the best story of the origin of creation that I have ever come across, and even gives a very good reason for why there is so much war and violence in our world. If you have any metaphysical bent, I think you will especially enjoy that portion of the essay, titled \"In the Beginning.\" It is near the beginning of the essay. By no means does this material answer all my deepest questions, but it certainly helped me to answer some of them in very surprising ways. Here's the link: [https://www.WantToKnow.info/secret_societies/hidden_hand_bloodlines](https://www.WantToKnow.info/secret_societies/hidden_hand_bloodlines) I highly recommend reading at least the first two or three pages of this material to see if it grabs you. For me, it helped to explain a lot about why some things in our world are so crazy. Our world even makes sense to me now, which it didn't for many years, largely as a result of this material. I think I even know now why certain of our world leaders seem bent on creating war and violence in our world. Read the editorial comment at the end of the essay to find out more about this. And there are lots of great ideas in this essay for how we can transform our lives and grow spiritually, too. What exciting times we live in! Thanks to all of you for your interest in this stuff and in finding ever more ways to transform our world through love and empowerment. Together, we are making a big difference.

With sacred love and warm wishes, Fred December 28, 2011 ** **** From [Revelations of an Elite Family Insider (2005)](http://www.scribd.com/doc/403303/The-Revelations-of-an-Elite-Family-Insider-2005)**[http://www.scribd.com/doc/403303/The-Revelations-of-an-Elite-Family-Insider-2005](http://www.scribd.com/doc/403303/The-Revelations-of-an-Elite-Family-Insider-2005) Q: Is there in fact a force that tries to keep people in a sleepwalking state, a force that does NOT want people to \"be all they can be\"? If so, what is the best way to deal with it in your experience? A: It is connected to the operations of your physical body which rebels every time you reach higher to that realm. The physical body has the task to let you experience this reality, and whenever you search for the other, it resists. It is its duty, so respecting this and gently taming your body is the best approach. Also beings will accompany your thoughts and try to divert them. Again it is their duty. Show respect and that will be recognised by them. Never see them as malicious or evil, they only react to your actions. There is not a force which does not want you to be what you really are. The opposite is true, but they also have their tasks that they must fulfill. This is about a material part of you. Q: Are there any wholesale events on the horizon that will translate into a quantum leap in mass consciousness and/or redefine life and the way it is lived? A: No, nothing like that. It is on a personal level, meaning you getting self-conscious yourself through the tools available to you. There may be an event which would alter the way civilisation is perceived now (it has happened before many times), but that will have nothing to do with what you mentioned. Your duty towards the One and yourself still stays the same, no matter what happens. Do not waste energy waiting for events, your stay will only be extended. A: I might add this, which may sound contrary to what I said, but read carefully: When the masses are made to believe something negative, they may create what they did not want. This is how, for instance, the \"NWO\", as you people call it, works. You believe it is taking shape, so it will take shape. And conspiracy theorists are major players in helping this taking shape by bombarding you with \"facts\" that it is taking shape. They claim you are", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:insider__11_inspiring_quotes_deep_insider.txt:0:ef0d77e39437", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 11560, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "insider__11_inspiring_quotes_deep_insider.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "insider__11_inspiring_quotes_deep_insider", "chunk_index": 1, "text": "might add this, which may sound contrary to what I said, but read carefully: When the masses are made to believe something negative, they may create what they did not want.

And conspiracy theorists are major players in helping this taking shape by bombarding you with \"facts\" that it is taking shape. They claim you are giving up power everyday, and that \"they\" control you more ... while in reality you are in full control. So the very people who are \"waking up\" to it are the ones who are creating it. Visualization works for both positive and negative thoughts. But I repeat, even if these things would happen, your duty towards the One and yourself still stays the same. A: You are not in the body, but encompass/envelop it, while being present in another invisible body which consists of similar elements to the Soul (which is you). Yet this invisible body is entangled with the physical plane (this is very important for you to understand) and connects with the visible body through energies transmitted by the invisible body to the brains, heart and areas in the spine. Hence we (as Souls) may control the body and its functions, enabling us to experience this realm. Souls are dual, meaning you are also somewhere else, waiting to be united in another realm. **Quote from Laura Eisenhower - Great-Granddaughter of President Dwight Eisenhower** Many things have agendas: governments, star systems, beings, races like the Orion Empire, the Supreme Being, the Galactic Federation, and the secret government. But ultimately it all serves an important purpose to our awakening and journey back to Source - or to anywhere in the cosmos we choose to adventure - as we open up to aspects of ourselves of which we are not fully conscious. Each agenda ultimately serves the Supreme Being in ourselves who knows what we need. This supposed free-will and extreme duality is testing us. It is designed to initiate us into the ultimate freedom. What was once lost or forgotten will be reclaimed, enabling us to journey into the beyond. The adventure only becomes richer. Each of us signed up for a part to play in this game, and ultimately everything leads back to Source divine unconditional Love. As we get ever closer, the experience reveals ever more magic, miracles and bliss. **Thoughts From Fred** It is often in the silence between the words that space is created for the deepest, most meaningful connections.

This video is in Spanish with English subtitles. I resonated with most of what this very enlightened soul has to say.\n\nI especially like his comments towards the end on how in the old world, various groups and forces outside of ourselves played a large role in creating the reality in which we lived. In this new world which is currently birthing, each of us is increasingly creating the reality in which we live through an internal process. By understanding and transforming our own inner processes, we are increasingly able to co-create the world in which we live the way we want and intend it to be.

Shorter versions are provided for several of the essays if you have limited time. I'll copy this new section for you here. Afterwards, I also have some comments, and then some inspiring information on a completely different topic for you. **Mind Control: The Big Picture** For those interested in understanding the big picture behind mind control and how it is powerfully influences our lives and world, we recommend exploring the resources below in sequence. The first two resources are of an introductory nature, while the last two tie all of the earlier information together in a way that makes a lot of sense, though it is difficult to know for certain about such things. You are invited to open to divine guidance as you explore all of these. Though it is unlikely that all information detailed in these resources is correct, if you follow the links and verify what is presented, you are very likely to see that there is a bigger picture to mind control which has many layers and levels to it. And very few are aware of all of these. Ultimately there is much reason for hope and optimism, as we all came here to learn, to grow, and to experience the gift of life together. By educating ourselves and spreading the word, we can make a big difference.

Written by a woman who goes by the name Svali, it dovetails with the Hidden Hand material (the sixth item) and fills in some key pieces that were missing for me. She's written a lot of great information, so I'll be developing this further on the website. If you want to understand the way key secret societies are able to greatly manipulate our world, I most highly recommend that you at least explore this Svali summary. Now to change the topic completely, I'll copy below for you a message which greatly inspired me recently. **Loving Teams** We are suggesting that you stand in the hologame--in the comfortable and familiar physical reality--and allow your consciousness to expand and include the possibility that there is a doorway open to other realms, and you have a personal invitation to walk through.... There are loving teams of beings ever ready to support and guide you and all others into this new adventure. The important key to remember is the willingness and the asking. State your intentions clearly and then surrender. Daily practices that connect you with your most Divine aspect are important.... You can give yourself this gift by sitting quietly-feeling the physical body, sensing the energy body, and, with your awareness in your heart, sending gratitude and appreciation on your breath to your Divine aspect. Allow and welcome the love and energy that flows back in return. This simple exercise will strengthen you on all levels of being ness. Remember that energy follows thought. Watch your thoughts. Stay very vigilant with your thoughts, your emotions, and your words. Each one carries a vibration. It is your responsibility to recognize and shift the energy signature you are offering to the collective. This is far more important than you realize.

Just made available for sale last month, The Afterlife Investigations presents incredible evidence of life after death from a mind-blowing five-year experiment on communicating with the dead and more. I'll be sending a special message on this out to our two email lists (which now have over 11,000 subscribers) in about 10 days, but I wanted to let you see it first.\n\nThe videographer and producer of this inspiring documentary, Tim Coleman, was one of three who collaborated on what I believe to be the best UFO documentary ever, Out of the Blue (which you can view at [this link](https://www.personalgrowthcourses.net/video/ufo_videos)). I was thrilled to meet Tim at a gathering several years ago, after which we became friends. He's a most amazing and intriguing man, and an incredibly skilled documentary maker.\n\nI've been watching Tim put together this most recent documentary with great anticipation for a couple years. I am so happy that it is finally done and available. For financial reasons, Tim cannot make the film available for free, but he did give me permission to make a promotional 16-minute summary of the film, which I think will blow you away. You can watch it at:\n\n[**https://www.personalgrowthcourses.net/video/afterlife_investigations**](https://www.personalgrowthcourses.net/video/afterlife_investigations)\n\nI also highly recommend the entire DVD, which can be purchased at [this link](http://www.theafterlifeinvestigations.com).

This is so that we can open the eyes of the many good, caring people who know little about all that is going on behind the scenes. At the same time, I'm glad to have this smaller list of key people (about 100 of you) who are in the know and want to know more to share the deeper, less reliable information I receive which I suspect has a lot of validity. I received some fascinating information today on big changes going on behind the scenes. The information comes from David Wilcock and Benjamin Fulford in an interview they did together on Wed. Sept 14th. I find David Wilcock ([http://www.divinecosmos.com](http://www.divinecosmos.com)) to be one of the brightest minds who is \"in the know\" on this planet. On the downside, he has an arrogance which can be a turn-off for some, and he sometimes jumps to conclusions too quickly for my taste. That said, I can't think of anyone who does a better job in covering the full depth and breadth of what's going on deep behind the scenes on our planet. He also has contact with quite a number of deep insiders. I am certain some of those insiders are disinformation agents, yet I suspect many aren't. I also love that he is as optimistic as I am about our world and future. As always, I advise a healthy skepticism and using your intuition in exploring David's research and claims. Benjamin Fulford ([http://benjaminfulford.net](http://benjaminfulford.net)) for me is much more of a mixed bag. Having worked as the Asian Bureau chief for Forbes magazine for years, he has some impressive credentials. The fact that he was able to get reclusive David Rockefeller to meet with him in Nov. 2007 speaks volumes, especially as that was well after he started spilling the beans about the global cabal that wants to control our world and destroy much of the population (do a search on the Fulford-Rockefeller interview to watch it). I am certain that, with his press background and more, Fulford's claims of close ties with top people in politics and Asian secret societies are real. Yet Fulford has also made outrageous claims which have turned out not to be true. He also tends to be much more fear based than I like, and I think he is much more subject to influence from disinformation than David Wilcock. At the same time, some of the outrageous claims Fulford has made have turned out to be true. In the interview between these two at the link below, Fulford tells Wilcock that both the earthquake near Denver just before midnight on August 22nd and the one near Washington, DC on", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:insider__11_strange_earthquakes_big_changes.txt:0:65fdbcc856e6", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 11568, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "insider__11_strange_earthquakes_big_changes.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "insider__11_strange_earthquakes_big_changes", "chunk_index": 1, "text": "to be true.

In the interview between these two at the link below, Fulford tells Wilcock that both the earthquake near Denver just before midnight on August 22nd and the one near Washington, DC on August 23rd were actually underground nuclear explosions which destroyed key secret underground complexes of a global cabal intent on controlling the world. The cabal had planned to use these underground cities as a place to safely escape while they waited for the devastation to pass from their efforts to decimate the human population. The cabal, he claims, has already been on the defensive for several years against those who don't want humanity decimated. But after these underground strikes, they are really running scared now. From my own research and intuition, I highly suspect he is right about this. Here's the interview link: [http://divinecosmos.com/start-here/davids-blog/975-undergroundbases](http://divinecosmos.com/start-here/davids-blog/975-undergroundbases) Please note that there are some pretty out there claims in this interview. I definitely am highly skeptical about some of them. But I've checked and there is some pretty solid, verifiable evidence that, at the least, the two earthquakes in question were not natural.

That said, I suspect it could have been cause by HAARP-like technologies. I do know Fulford is on to something. I invite us all to be skeptical, yet open in exploring these matters. If you are interested in more, read and/or listen to the interview at the link above. What exciting times we live in! I deeply believe that every one of us makes a difference, sometimes even by something as simple as just being open to this information. Let us all do our best to energetically support a major shift on our planet towards love and empowerment for all. Together, we make a big difference! Take care, and enjoy the weekend.

They are both dozens of pages long, but I found them well worth the time. Some of you will remember the name Wilbur Smith, the Canadian official who was involved in UFO activities and new energy explorations in the 1950s. He is particularly known for a quote from a declassified memo of his, which states, \"Flying saucers exist. The matter is the most highly classified subject in the US Government, rating higher even than the H-bomb.\"\n\nMr. Smith claims to have been in direct contact with at least one ET group. I highly suspect this is true. He wrote the most astounding description of alternate dimensions and deep forces of the universe that I have ever seen, claiming this information came from \"beings more advanced than we are.\" If you are interested in such things, click on the link below to read this mind-boggling essay. At the bottom of the webpage is a link to other writings of his, which I also found most intriguing.\n\n[https://www.WantToKnow.info/energy/wilbur_smith_new_science](https://www.WantToKnow.info/energy/wilbur_smith_new_science)\n\nAnother piece, though not quite as far out as Smith's, is an essay by Dutchman Johan Oldenkamp, with whom I have had email contact. His piece titled, \"The Big Picture\" also presents some new concepts I found quite intriguing. I don't resonate with the predictions around 2012 and a few of his other concepts, but if nothing else, his ideas are fresh and stimulating. I welcome your comments.\n\n[http://www.pateo.nl/PDF/TheBiggerPicture.pdf](http://www.pateo.nl/PDF/TheBiggerPicture.pdf)\n\nAnd if you haven't already seen the seven-page big picture summary of life I wrote at [https://www.WantToKnow.info/meaningoflifebigpicture](https://www.WantToKnow.info/meaningoflifebigpicture), you might enjoy that as well.

More than a hundred years after the release of this book, kids everywhere are still enchanted by Oz's world of wonder. Few, however, recognize that, under its deceptive simplicity, the story of the Wizard of Oz conceals deep esoteric truths inspired by Theosophy. Here we'll look at the Wizard of Oz's occult meaning and its author's background.* Although the Wizard of Oz is widely perceived as an innocent children's fairy tale, it is almost impossible not to attribute a symbolic meaning to Dorothy's quest. As in all great stories, the characters and the symbols of the Wizard of Oz can be given a second layer of interpretation, which may vary depending on the reader's perception. Many analyses appeared throughout the years describing the story as an \"atheist manifesto\" while others saw it as a promotion of populism. It is through an understanding of the author's philosophical background and beliefs, however, that the story's true meaning can be grasped. L. Frank Baum, the author of the Wizard of Oz was a member of the Theosophical Society, which is an organization based on occult research and the comparative study of religions. Baum had a deep understanding of Theosophy and, consciously or not, created an allegory of Theosophic teachings when he wrote the Wizard of Oz. **What is Theosophy?** The Theosophical Society is an occult organization, mainly based on the teachings of Helena P. Blavatsky, which seeks to extract the common roots of all religions in order to form a universal doctrine. *\"But it is perhaps desirable to state unequivocally that the teachings, however fragmentary and incomplete, contained in these volumes, belong neither to the Hindu, the Zoroastrian, the Chaldean, nor the Egyptian religion,.neither to Buddhism, Islam, Judaism nor Christianity exclusively.

The Secret Doctrine is the essence of all these. Sprung from it in their origins, the various religious schemes are now made to merge back into their original element, out of which every mystery and dogma has grown, developed, and become materialized.\"* -H.P. Blavatsky, The Secret Doctrine The three declared objects of the original Theosophical Society as established by Blavatsky, Judge and Olcott (its founders) were as follows: *\"First - To form a nucleus of the Universal Brotherhood of Humanity, without distinction of race, creed, sex, caste, or color. Second - To encourage the study of Comparative Religion, Philosophy, and Science. Third - To investigate the unexplained laws of Nature and the powers latent in man.\" * -The Theosophist, vol 75, No 6 The main tenets of Theosophy are thoroughly described in Blavatsky works *Isis Unveiled* and *The Secret Doctrine*. At the core of Theosophical teachings are the same tenets found in many other occult schools: the belief of the presence of a \"divine spark\" within every person which, with the proper discipline and training, can lead to spiritual illumination and a state of virtual godliness. Another important principle found in Theosophy is reincarnation. It is believed that the human soul, like all other things in the universe, go through seven stages of development. *\"Theosophical writings propose that human civilizations, like all other parts of the universe, develop cyclically through seven stages. Blavatsky posited that the whole humanity, and indeed every reincarnating human monad, evolves through a series of seven \"Root Races\". Thus in the first age, humans were pure spirit; in the second age, they were sexless beings inhabiting the now lost continent of Hyperborea; in the third age the giant Lemurians were informed by spiritual impulses endowing them with human consciousness and sexual reproduction. Modern humans finally developed on the continent of Atlantis. Since Atlantis was the nadir of the cycle, the present fifth age is a time of reawakening humanity's psychic gifts. The term psychic here really means the realization of the permeability of consciousness as it had not been known earlier in evolution, although sensed by some more sensitive individuals of our species.\"* The ultimate goal is of course to return to the state of divinity from which we've emerged. The same tenets (with subtle variations) can be found in other schools such as Rosicrucianism, Freemasonry and other orders teachings the Mysteries. **L.

Frank Baum, a Notable Theosophist** Before writing the Wizard of Oz (or even contemplating becoming a children's story author), Baum held many jobs - one of which was editor of the *Aberdeen Saturday Pioneer*. In 1890, Baum wrote a series of articles introducing his readers to Theosophy, including his views on Buddha, Mohammed, Confucius and Christ. At that time, he wasn't a member of the Theosophical Society but he already showed a deep understanding of its philosophy. Here's an excerpt of his \"Editor's Musings\": *\"Amongst various sects so numerous in America today who find their fundamental basis in occultism, the Theosophist stands pre-eminent both in intelligence and point of numbers. Theosophy is not a religion. Its followers are simply \"searchers after Truth\". The Theosophists, in fact, are the dissatisfied with the world, dissenters from all creeds. They owe their origin to the wise men of India, and are numerous, not only in the far famed mystic East, but in England, France, Germany and Russia. They admit the existence of a God - not necessarily of a personal God. To them God is Nature and Nature is God...But despite this, if Christianity is Truth, as our education has taught us to believe, there can be no menace to it in Theosophy.\"* -L. Frank Baum, Aberdeen Saturday Pioneer, January 25th 1890 In another of his \"Editor's Musings\", Baum discusses the use of mystic symbolism in fiction, something he accomplished ten years later with the Wizard of Oz: *\"There is a strong tendency in modern novelists towards introducing some vein of mysticism or occultism into their writings. Books of this character are eagerly bought and read by the people, both in Europe and America. It shows the innate longing in our natures to unravel the mysterious: to seek some explanation, however fictitious, of the unexplainable in nature and in our daily existence. For, as we advance in education, our desire for knowledge increases, and we are less satisfied to remain in ignorance of that mysterious fountain-head from which emanates all that is sublime and grand and incomprehensible in nature.\"* At the end of this article, Baum goes into an all-out plead for more occultism in literature: *\"The appetite of our age for occultism demands to be satisfied, and while with the mediocrity of people will result in mere sensationalism, it will lead in many to higher and nobler and bolder thought; and who can tell what mysteries these braver and abler intellects may unravel in future ages?\"* -L. Frank Baum, Aberdeen Saturday Pioneer, February 22nd 1890 Two years after writing those articles, L.

Frank Baum, Aberdeen Saturday Pioneer, February 22nd 1890 Two years after writing those articles, L. Frank Baum and his wife Maud Gage joined the Theosophical Society in Chicago. The archives of the Theosophical Society in Pasadena, California recorded the start of their membership as September 4th, 1892. In 1890, the Wizard of Oz was published. When asked about how Baum got his inspiration for the story, he replied: *\"It was pure inspiration... It came to me right out of the blue. I think that sometimes the Great Author has a message to get across and He has to use the instrument at hand. I happened to be that medium, and I believe the magic key was given me to open the doors to sympathy and understanding, joy, peace and happiness.\"* -L. Frank Baum, cited by Hearn 73 The Wizard of Oz is much appreciated within the Theosophical Society. In 1986, The *American Theosophist* magazine recognized Baum as a \"notable Theosophist\" who thoroughly represented the organization's philosophy. *\"Although readers have not looked at his fairy tales for their Theosophical content, it is significant that Baum became a famous writer of children's books after he came into contact with Theosophy. Theosophical ideas permeate his work and provided inspiration for it. Indeed, The Wizard can be regarded as Theosophical allegory, pervaded by Theosophical ideas from beginning to end. The story came to Baum as an inspiration, and he accepted it with a certain awe as a gift from outside, or perhaps from deep within, himself.\"* -American Theosophist no 74, 1986 So what is the esoteric meaning of this children's story, which came to Baum as a \"divine inspiration\"? **The Occult Meaning of The Wizard of Oz** If you've never read or watched The Wizard of Oz or need your memory refreshed, here's a quick sum-up of the movie: The film follows 12-year-old farmgirl Dorothy Gale (Judy Garland) who lives on a Kansas farm with her Aunt Em and Uncle Henry, but dreams of a better place \"somewhere over the rainbow.\" After being struck unconscious during a tornado by a window which has come loose from its frame, Dorothy dreams that she, her dog Toto and the farmhouse are transported to the magical Land of Oz. There, the Good Witch of the North, Glinda (Billie Burke), advises Dorothy to follow the yellow brick road to the Emerald City and meet the Wizard of Oz, who can return her to Kansas. During her journey, she meets a Scarecrow (Ray Bolger), a Tin Man (Jack Haley)", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:insider__11_wizard_of_oz_occult_roots.txt:3:51a115446c4a", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 11575, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "insider__11_wizard_of_oz_occult_roots.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "insider__11_wizard_of_oz_occult_roots", "chunk_index": 4, "text": "unconscious during a tornado by a window which has come loose from its frame, Dorothy dreams that she, her dog Toto and the farmhouse are transported to the magical Land of Oz. There, the Good Witch of the North, Glinda (Billie Burke), advises Dorothy to follow the yellow brick road to the Emerald City and meet the Wizard of Oz, who can return her to Kansas. During her journey, she meets a Scarecrow (Ray Bolger), a Tin Man (Jack Haley) and a Cowardly Lion (Bert Lahr), who join her, hoping to receive what they lack themselves (a brain, a heart and courage, respectively). All of this is done while also trying to avoid the Wicked Witch of the West (Margaret Hamilton) and her attempt to get her sister's ruby slippers from Dorothy, who received them from Glinda. The said above, the entire story of the Wizard of Oz is an allegorical tale of the soul's path to illumination - the Yellow Brick Road. In Buddhism (an important part of Theosophical teachings) the same concept is referred to as the \"Golden Path\". The story starts with Dorothy Gale living in Kansas, which symbolizes the material world, the physical plane where each one of us starts our spiritual journey. Dorothy feels an urge to \"go over the rainbow\", to reach the ethereal realm and follow the path to illumination. She has basically \"passed the Nadir\" by demonstrating the urge to seek a higher truth. Dorothy is then brought to Oz by a giant cyclone spiraling upward, representing the cycles of karma, the cycle of errors and lessons learned. It also represents the theosophical belief in reincarnation, the round of physical births and deaths of a soul until it is fit to become divine. It is also interesting to note that the Yellow Brick Road of Oz begins as an outwardly expanding spiral. In occult symbolism, this spiral represents the evolving self, the soul ascending from matter into the spirit world. Here's an explanation of the spiral as an occult symbol: *\"**Spiral:** The path of a point (generally plane) which moves round an axis while continually approaching it or receding from it; also often used for a helix, which is generated by compounding a circular motion with one in a straight line. The spiral form is an apt illustration of the course of evolution, which brings motion round towards the same point, yet without repetition. The serpent, and the figures 8 and , denoting the ogdoad and infinity, stand for spiral cyclic motion. The course of fohat in space is spiral, and spirit descends into matter in spiral courses. Repeating the process by which a helix is derived form a circle produces a vortex. The complicated spirals of cosmic evolution bring the motion back to the point from which it started at the birth of a great cosmic age.\"* -The Encyclopedic Theosophical Glossary", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:insider__11_wizard_of_oz_occult_roots.txt:4:872d5626a1b2", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 11576, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "insider__11_wizard_of_oz_occult_roots.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "insider__11_wizard_of_oz_occult_roots", "chunk_index": 5, "text": "without repetition.

The complicated spirals of cosmic evolution bring the motion back to the point from which it started at the birth of a great cosmic age.\"* -The Encyclopedic Theosophical Glossary Before undertaking her journey, Dorothy is given the \"silver shoes\", which represent the \"silver cord\" of Mystery Schools (Dorothy was wearing ruby slippers in the movie due to a last minute change by the director, who thought that the color ruby looked better against the Yellow Brick Road). In occult schools, the silver cord is considered to be the link between our material and spiritual selves. *\"In Theosophy, one's physical body and one's Astral body are connected through a \"silver cord\", a mythical link inspired by a passage in the Bible that speaks of a return from a spiritual quest. 'Or ever the silver cord be loosed, says the book of Ecclesiastes, 'then shall the dust return to the earth as it was and the spirit shall return unto God who gave it'.* *In Frank Baum's own writing, the silver cord of Astral travel would inspire the silver shoes that bestow special powers upon the one who wears them\"* -Evan I. Schwartz, Finding OZ: How L. Frank Baum Discovered the Great American Story During her journey along the Yellow Brick road, Dorothy encounters Scarecrow, Tin Woodman and Cowardly Lion who are respectively searching for a brain, a heart and courage. Those odd characters embody the qualities needed by the initiates in order to complete their quest for illumination. Baum was probably inspired by these words from Miss Blavatsky: *\"There is no danger that dauntless courage cannot conquer, there is not trial that a spotless purity cannot pass through; there is no difficulty a strong intellect cannot surmount\"* - H.P. Blavatsky After surmounting many obstacles, the party finally reaches Emerald city in order to meet The Wizard. **The Wizard** Surrounded by artifices and special effects, the Wizard comes across as cruel, rude and unwise. The Wizard is in fact a stand-in for the personal God of the Christians and the Jews, the oppressive figure used by conventional religions to keep the masses in spiritual darkness: Jehova or Yahwe. It is later discovered that the Wizard is a humbug, a charlatan, who scares people into worshipping his Wizard. He surely could not help the characters complete their quest.

If you read literature of Mystery schools, this point of view towards Christianity is constantly expressed. After all is said and done, the brains, the heart and the courage needed to complete Dorothy, Scarecrow, Tinman and Lion's quests were found within each one of them. Mystery Schools have always taught their students that one must rely on oneself to obtain salvation. Throughout the story Dorothy's dog Toto represents her \"inner voice\"; her intuition. Here's a description of Toto taken from the Theosophical Society's website: *\"Toto represents the inner, intuitive, instinctual, most animal-like part of us. Throughout the movie, Dorothy has conversations with Toto, or her inner intuitive self. The lesson here is to listen to the Toto within. In this movie, Toto was never wrong. When he barks at the scarecrow, Dorothy tries to ignore him: \"Don't be silly, Toto. Scarecrows don't talk.\" But scarecrows do talk in Oz. Toto also barks at the little man behind the curtain. It is he who realizes the Wizard is a fraud. At the Gale Farm and again at the castle, the Witch tries to put Toto into a basket. What is shadow will try to block or contain the intuitive. In both cases, Toto jumps out of the basket and escapes. Our intuitive voice can be ignored, but not contained.* *In the last scene, Toto chases after a cat, causing Dorothy to chase after him and hence miss her balloon ride. This is what leads to Dorothy's ultimate transformation, to the discovery of her inner powers. The balloon ride is representative of traditional religion, with a skinny-legged wizard promising a trip to the Divine. Toto was right to force Dorothy out of the balloon, otherwise she might never have found her magic. This is a call for us to listen to our intuition, our gut feelings, those momentary bits of imagination that appear seemingly out of nowhere.\"* As stated above, the fake Wizard invites Dorothy into his balloon to go back to Kansas, her final destination. She however follows Toto (her intuition) and gets out of the balloon, which represents the empty promises of organized religions. This leads to her ultimate revelation and, with the help of the Good Witch of the North (her divine guide), she finally understands: everything she ever wanted could be found \"in her own backyard\". In order to obtain illumination Dorothy had to vanquish the wicked witches of the East and the West - who were forming an evil horizontal axis: the material world. She was wise in listening to the advice of the good witches of the North and South - the vertical axis: the spiritual dimension.

She was wise in listening to the advice of the good witches of the North and South - the vertical axis: the spiritual dimension. At the end of the story, Dorothy wakes up in Kansas: she has successfully combined her physical and spiritual life. She is now comfortable being herself again and, despite her family not really believing the details of her quest (the ignorant profane), she can finally say \"There is no place like home\". **The Wizard of Oz Used in Monarch Mind Control** Almost all documentation relating to the MK Ultra project and Mind Control mention the importance of the Wizard of Oz. In the 1940?s, the story was reportedly chosen by members of the US intelligence community to provide a thematic foundation for their trauma-based mind control program. The movie was edited and given a different meaning in order to use it as a tool to reinforce the programming on the victims. Here are some examples taken from Fritz Springmeier's *Total Mind Control Slave*: The close relationship between Dorothy and her dog is a very subtle connection between the satanic cults use of animals (familiars). A Monarch slave child will be allowed to bond with a pet. The child will want to bond with a pet anyway because people are terrifying to it by this point. Then the pet is killed to traumatize the child. Monarch slaves are taught to \"follow the yellow brick road.\" No matter what fearful things lie ahead, the Monarch slave must follow the Yellow Brick Road which is set out before them by their master. The rainbow-with its seven colors-has long had the occult significance of being a great spiritual, hypnotic device. Dorothy is looking for a place where there is no trouble, which is a place \"over the rainbow.\" To escape pain, alters go over the rainbow. (This is a.k.a. in Alice In Wonderland Programming as \"going through the looking glass\"). \"Somewhere Over the Rainbow\" is probably the most dissociative song ever written and is often played in movies during violent or traumatizing events (see the movie Face-Off). The strange effect produced, where the violence doesn't seem real anymore, is exactly how dissociation works on mind-control victims. We may also speculate that the scene where Dorothy falls asleep in a poppy field is a reference to the use of heroin to relax and manipulate the victims of mind-control. Also consider the snow falling from the sky that awakens Dorothy from her slumber. Could this be a reference to cocaine? **In Conclusion** Allegorical stories transmitting spiritual truths have existed", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:insider__11_wizard_of_oz_occult_roots.txt:7:dc38ad1b489f", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 11579, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "insider__11_wizard_of_oz_occult_roots.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "insider__11_wizard_of_oz_occult_roots", "chunk_index": 8, "text": "The strange effect produced, where the violence doesn't seem real anymore, is exactly how dissociation works on mind-control victims.

Also consider the snow falling from the sky that awakens Dorothy from her slumber. Could this be a reference to cocaine? **In Conclusion** Allegorical stories transmitting spiritual truths have existed since man's beginnings. These simple yet extremely profound stories have been found in all civilizations: Celtic, Indian, Persian, Aztec, Greek, Egyptian and others. Consciously or not, Frank Baum created a classical allegory which, in the same vein as Homer's Odyssey, entertains the masses and also contains mystical messages that can be understood by the \"awakened\". The Wizard of Oz's great success confirms America's (and the Western world's) real spiritual dogma. Written during the 1890?s, when most Americans were conservative Christians, Baum's story anticipated the population's progressive abandonment of traditional religions and the embrace of a new form of spirituality. Today's New Age movements are gaining many adepts and, even if most of them are total shams, they all claim to be inspired by Theosophy. Could such tales have contributed to the spectacular decline of Christianity in the past decades while other movements continue to gain momentum?

The general public became aware for the first time of huge manipulations going on behind the scenes that affected the entire global economy. All were able to see that the emperor was wearing no clothes.

If we all join in calling for reform, our ripples can become waves of change which sweep the planet. Thanks for caring and have a beautiful day.

It could be done cleanly and painlessly, by legislative command, far more quickly than anybody imagined. **The conjuring trick is to replace our system of private bank-created money -- roughly 97pc of the money supply -- with state-created money.** We return to the historical norm, before Charles II placed control of the money supply in private hands with the English Free Coinage Act of 1666. Specifically, **it means an assault on \"[fractional reserve banking](https://www.WantToKnow.info/financialbankingcoverup#fractional)\".** If lenders are forced to put up 100pc reserve backing for deposits, they lose the exorbitant privilege of creating money out of thin air. **The nation regains sovereign control over the money supply.** There are no more banks runs, and fewer boom-bust credit cycles.

Entitled \"[**The Chicago Plan Revisited**](http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/wp/2012/wp12202.pdf)\", it revives the scheme first put forward by professors Henry Simons and Irving Fisher in 1936 during the ferment of creative thinking in the late Depression. Irving Fisher thought credit cycles led to an unhealthy concentration of wealth. He saw it with his own eyes in the early 1930s as creditors foreclosed on destitute farmers, seizing their land or buying it for a pittance at the bottom of the cycle. The farmers found a way of defending themselves in the end. They muscled together at \"one dollar auctions\", buying each other's property back for almost nothing. Any carpet-bagger who tried to bid higher was beaten to a pulp. **Benes and Kumhof argue that credit-cycle trauma - caused by private money creation - dates deep into history** and lies at the root of debt jubilees in the ancient religions of Mesopotian and the Middle East. Harvest cycles led to systemic defaults thousands of years ago, with forfeiture of collateral, and concentration of wealth in the hands of lenders. These episodes were not just caused by weather, as long thought. They were amplified by the effects of credit. The Athenian leader Solon implemented the first known Chicago Plan/New Deal in 599 BC to relieve farmers in hock to oligarchs enjoying private coinage. He cancelled debts, restituted lands seized by creditors, set floor-prices for commodities (much like Franklin Roosevelt), and consciously flooded the money supply with state-issued \"debt-free\" coinage. The Romans sent a delegation to study Solon's reforms 150 years later and copied the ideas, setting up their own fiat money system under Lex Aternia in 454 BC. It is a myth - innocently propagated by the great Adam Smith - that money developed as a commodity-based or gold-linked means of exchange. Gold was always highly valued, but that is another story. Metal-lovers often conflate the two issues. **Anthropological studies show that social fiat currencies began with the dawn of time.** The Spartans banned gold coins, replacing them with iron disks of little intrinsic value. The early Romans used bronze tablets. Their worth was entirely determined by law - a doctrine made explicit by Aristotle in his Ethics - like the dollar, the euro, or sterling today. Some argue that Rome began to lose its solidarity spirit when it allowed an oligarchy to develop a private silver-based coinage during the Punic Wars. Money slipped control of the Senate.

You could call it Rome's shadow banking system. Evidence suggests that it became a machine for elite wealth accumulation. Unchallenged sovereign or Papal control over currencies persisted through the Middle Ages until England broke the mould in 1666. Benes and Kumhof say this was the start of the boom-bust era. One might equally say that this opened the way to England's agricultural revolution in the early 18th Century, the industrial revolution soon after, and the greatest economic and technological leap ever seen. But let us not quibble. The original authors of the Chicago Plan were responding to the Great Depression. They believed it was possible to prevent the social havoc caused by wild swings from boom to bust, and to do so without crimping economic dynamism. **The benign side-effect of their proposals would be a switch from national debt to national surplus, as if by magic.** \"Because under the Chicago Plan banks have to borrow reserves from the treasury to fully back liabilities, the government acquires a very large asset vis-à-vis banks. Our analysis finds that the government is left with a much lower, in fact negative, net debt burden.\" The IMF paper says total liabilities of the US financial system - including shadow banking - are about 200pc of GDP. The new reserve rule would create a windfall. This would be used for a \"potentially a very large, buy-back of private debt\", perhaps 100pc of GDP. While Washington would issue much more fiat money, this would not be redeemable. It would be an equity of the commonwealth, not debt. **The key of the Chicago Plan was to separate the \"monetary and credit functions\" of the banking system.** \"The quantity of money and the quantity of credit would become completely independent of each other.\" Private lenders would no longer be able to create new deposits \"ex nihilo\". New bank credit would have to be financed by retained earnings. **\"The control of credit growth would become much more straightforward because banks would no longer be able, as they are today, to generate their own funding, deposits, in the act of lending, an extraordinary privilege that is not enjoyed by any other type of business,\" says the IMF paper. ** \"Rather, banks would become what many erroneously believe them to be today, pure intermediaries that depend on obtaining outside funding before being able to lend.\" The US Federal Reserve would take real control over the money supply for the first time, making it easier to manage inflation.

It was precisely for this reason that Milton Friedman called for 100pc reserve backing in 1967. Even the great free marketeer implicitly favoured a clamp-down on private money. The switch would engender a 10pc boost to long-arm economic output. \"None of these benefits come at the expense of diminishing the core useful functions of a private financial system.\" Simons and Fisher were flying blind in the 1930s. They lacked the modern instruments needed to crunch the numbers, so the IMF team has now done it for them -- using the `DSGE' stochastic model now de rigueur in high economics, loved and hated in equal measure. The finding is startling. Simons and Fisher understated their claims. It is perhaps possible to confront the banking plutocracy head without endangering the economy. Benes and Kumhof make large claims. They leave me baffled, to be honest. Readers who want the technical details can make their own judgement by studying the text** [here](http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/wp/2012/wp12202.pdf). ** The IMF duo have supporters. Professor Richard Werner from Southampton University - who coined the term quantitative easing (QE) in the 1990s -- testified to Britain's Vickers Commission that a switch to state-money would have major welfare gains. He was backed by the campaign group Positive Money and the New Economics Foundation. The theory also has strong critics. Tim Congdon from International Monetary Research says banks are in a sense already being forced to increase reserves by EU rules, Basel III rules, and gold-plated variants in the UK. The effect has been to choke lending to the private sector. He argues that is the chief reason why the world economy remains stuck in near-slump, and why central banks are having to cushion the shock with QE. \"If you enacted this plan, it would devastate bank profits and cause a massive deflationary disaster. There would have to do `QE squared' to offset it,\" he said. The result would be a huge shift in bank balance sheets from private lending to government securities. This happened during World War Two, but that was the anomalous cost of defeating Fascism. To do this on a permanent basis in peace-time would be to change in the nature of western capitalism. \"People wouldn't be able to get money from banks.

It might be even more irksome in the long run than rule by bankers. Personally, I am a long way from reaching an conclusion in this extraordinary debate. Let it run, and let us all fight until we flush out the arguments. One thing is sure. The City of London will have great trouble earning its keep if any variant of the Chicago Plan ever gains wide support. The original of this article on banking reforms can be found at [this link](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/comment/9623863/IMFs-epic-plan-to-conjure-away-debt-and-dethrone-bankers.html). **Note:** Respected monetary activists like Ellen Brown, author of *[Web of Debt](http://www.webofdebt.com/)*, Steven Zarlenga of the [American Monetary Institute](http://www.monetary.org/), and others have been calling for similar banking reforms for many years. And it's interesting to note that the author doesn't seem to realize that the U.S. Federal Reserve is [owned and controlled](https://www.WantToKnow.info/financialbankingcoverup) by large, privately owned banks, so the control of money would have to be removed from the Fed, or the U.S. government would have to take over the Fed.

This last year was particularly fertile in wild and expansive realizations. For any with the time and interest, I thought I would share a key section of my yearly summary on realizations I had as a result of my amazing monthly Bikram yoga practice. Take care, and have a most beautiful, meaningful, and love-filled new year ahead. And thank you so much for being a part of my life. With abundant love, joy, and gratitude, Fred January 6, 2012 **Bikram Realizations** The intense 90-minute Bikram yoga sessions in 105-degree heat that I do once a month continue to be one of my greatest sources of inspiration. Almost every month I get powerful realizations. I go into each session with a clear intention of what I want to explore. Pushing myself and the blood flowing out of my head after particularly intense bending stretches seems to open up channels that aren't normally open. The realizations often continue to flow while I lay resting on my mat after the session and even on the bicycle ride home and afterwards. I love these monthly sessions and am so grateful to the creator of Bikram for this wonderful form of yoga and meditation. Below are realizations I wrote down from three of the most profound sessions this year. As this section is fairly lengthy, **I've highlighted some of the key sections.** **June 14:** Great Bikram session today. I really pushed myself. Between poses, I could often feel the energy vibrating in my body in a most delicious way. The more I pushed into discomfort in each pose, the more delicious the healing energy felt in my body between poses. I saw this as a metaphor for life. **When we are willing to push past our own comfort zones, it is much easier to grow to new levels of wisdom and understanding.** And I was able to let go of another layer of urgency in my life and surrender to the joy of just being in love with the universe, with All That Is. Great stuff!!! **September 8: Each of us is always at the center of our own consciousness.** This consciousness experiences life both externally and internally at the same time, though one or the other tends to be more dominant in each moment.

The external world we experience largely through our five senses, while the internal world consists of all the conscious and unconscious processes that take place within us. When we are interacting with others or with our environment, like talking with a friend or watching a movie, we tend to be much more externally focused. The internal world is most commonly accessed through stillness, sleep, and meditation. Many people tend to value one of these more than the other in their lives, sometimes even neglecting or even holding judgment about the other. Yet I see both the external and the internal as vitally important parts of life. **The external, physical world allows us to engage fully in the journey of life on this planet, while the internal world is the place where what happens to us is processed, either consciously, unconsciously or both.** Our inner world strongly shapes our interpretation of everything that happens externally. In the external world, we get to experiment and explore who we are based on beliefs held within our inner world. I want to focus more on consciously welcoming greater awareness of both the internal and the external aspects of life, and particularly on being aware of the balance between them. What excites me is the possibility of being ever more aware of both the external and internal focus not only in myself, but even in others as I interact with them. I love having internal conversations with the internal awareness of whoever I'm interacting with, even as we may be having an externally focused conversation. I do this by silently communicating my deeper or more subtle thoughts and feelings in what feels like soul to soul communication. **When I am conscious of both the internal and external worlds of both myself and whoever I'm interacting with, it feels like a deeper harmony is created.** The symbol of the infinity sign comes to mind as a cycling of inner and outer awareness between myself and whoever I'm interacting with. I love to invite others to have more awareness of the inner processes as we interact, too. It's a way of fostering both greater transparency and intimacy. Many people consciously hide their inner processes from others in an attempt to create desired external perceptions of themselves in others. They thus create one or more personas which actually mask their inner essence and internal processes. This can be quite effective in achieving certain goals, yet it also takes a certain amount of energy to maintain. And those who are sensitive to both the external and internal can sense that something is not in harmony.

One of the reasons I feel so free and experience so much joy in my life is that I feel like I no longer have any masks or personas to maintain. I have reached a place where I totally enjoy just being who I am and sharing all parts of myself freely with any who are open to this. Life is so much easier and more fun this way! I attribute this to having done quite a bit of integration of my inner and outer worlds, yet I know there is always more to learn in this fascinating process. I also realized today how I have tended to trust the divine realms much more than people as I've moved through life. **I want to open more to the wisdom that I know all people around me have.** The divine realms represent the light, while the Earth and its people for me represent the shadow. And I'm understanding more all the time how the shadow is just as important as the light. Like the inner and outer worlds, both are very important to experiencing life in its fullness. I want to find ever more ways to balance and integrate these two in my life. I know that every person I meet has something to teach me if I am open to it. **October 4:** The below realizations from today's Bikram session came out of my explorations into the [Hidden Hand material](https://www.WantToKnow.info/secret_societies/deep_insider_creation_story). I sent them to my private \"In the Know\" email list and got some great comments in response. In this session, I entered a most amazing, divine realm. I had recently been feeling a lot of big energy shifts both in myself and in the world. As I realized ever more deeply how I/we co-created all of this, I wanted to take personal responsibility to new levels. I saw that I/we are co-creating something different now, something more infused with love and support from divine realms which exist both inside and outside of ourselves. What a powerful and unexpectedly profound experience!!! As I had been working on crafting summaries of the intriguing [Hidden Hand material](https://www.WantToKnow.info/secret_societies/deep_insider_creation_story), I went into this Bikram yoga session with the intention of opening to wisdom and guidance from group souls like that of the Hidden Hand, [Ra](http://www.llresearch.org/library/the_law_of_one_pdf/the_law_of_one_pdf.aspx) (Law of One), [Michael](http://www.michaelteachings.com/) (Messages from Michael), the [WingMakers](https://www.WantToKnow.info/wingmakers), and any other groups souls available.

I particularly opened to guidance with creating the summaries of the Hidden Hand material, which I will soon be sending out to the nearly 12,000 subscribers on our [two email lists](https://www.peerservice.org/subscribe_peers). As I got towards the end of this 90-minutes of challenging yoga postures and intense heat, I felt several times a rich connection and energetic exchange with these loving and supportive group entities. Yet the most amazing experience occurred after the session while I was lying on my mat in quiet stillness with my eyes closed. While breathing deeply in a state of surrender during this post-workout relaxation, I suddenly felt an invitation to move beyond these wise group souls to connect directly with a level of divinity even greater. As I opened to the invitation, I felt my consciousness expand into another dimension. My awareness felt like it moved quickly along an energetic line through a surrounding darkness, like following a beam of light through a dark tunnel. And then quite unexpectedly, I touched another realm. This realm I contacted is a completely different dimension - more like another universe, or the other side of the veil - far beyond time and space as we know it. I had previously been there in a few most profound sacred medicine journeys, but this was the first time I encountered this realm without any medicine assist. **With my body lying still on my yoga mat, yet having left behind awareness of this body, I touched and briefly merged with the edge of this dimension. I immediately felt the unbelievably profound love with which this realm pulses. In this other universe far outside of the normal dimensions of time and space in which we live here on Earth, all beings are fully conscious of their interconnections with each other as they flow in a radiant cosmic swirl of consciousness exploring itself.** Though in linear time it was only a brief moment of connection, I immediately saw for the first time that this amazing place or space of being is, in fact, what might be called the positive pole of existence. The conceptions of some of our most pioneering scientists on Earth hint at this place in their explorations into the worlds of antimatter, with the assumption that this place is somehow negatively charged. I saw, however, that it is our universe of time, space, and dense matter which is the negative pole of existence.

Matter is of a heavy density which from the expansive and all-loving perspective of this other realm would clearly be described as negative. The substance of the other realm (which scientists allude to as antimatter) is actually undeniably positive. The only \"matter\" which exists in this indescribable realm is in such an expanded state that it is almost the opposite of matter on Earth. All substance there is clearly seen and experienced as being composed of love and light, where here matter is seen more as something dense and solid, something to be used and manipulated. **It was very clear to me that the world in which we live is the dense negative pole or shadow universe, and that this other realm I touched briefly, sometimes referred to as the other side of the veil, is the expansive positive pole of existence.** In my very brief visit, I only touched and merged with the edges of this place, yet I could feel what so many who have had [near-death visions](https://www.weboflove.org/neardeathexperience) describe as a place filled with amazing love and vibrance. I could even feel a kind of collective consciousness of the place which some might refer to as God or the being of light there at the end of the tunnel. What an amazing, loving presence!!! As a result of this brief, yet timeless journey, I feel I now have a new map of existence based on the split between these two entirely different ways in which consciousness can experience itself. Looking at the roots of it all, I suspect that at the beginning of time or at some point beyond time, primal divine consciousness densified itself to the point of creating the perception of physical matter. Parts of divine consciousness were thus fragmented and separated into this new dimension or density in a way that blocked these fragments from having knowledge of their deeper interconnectedness with all beings and All That Is. This was done in order to eventually create new ways for the divine and for all of us fragments of the divine to experience ourselves. This new density could be described as a parallel universe where space and matter were created in a way that allowed fragments of divine consciousness to inhabit the matter, thus allowing our fragmented consciousness to have the unique experience of life in this densified universe in sequential time. These divine fragments (including all of us here on Earth) thus agreed to be", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:insider__12_bikram_yoga_realizations.txt:4:bed0ec944b99", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 11591, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "insider__12_bikram_yoga_realizations.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "insider__12_bikram_yoga_realizations", "chunk_index": 5, "text": "create new ways for the divine and for all of us fragments of the divine to experience ourselves.

These divine fragments (including all of us here on Earth) thus agreed to be anchored to physical bodies in order to experience the fullness of life in a three-dimensional universe. Not only that, they/we agreed to forget their/our origins in order to have full freedom to explore a completely new and different way of being. **In conceptualizing these two differing realms, I am reminded of a figure eight or infinity symbol where one side is positively charged and the other is negative. The positive side is largely pure consciousness exploring itself in worlds of love and light beyond time and space. The negative side is consciousness densified into space and matter to explore the mystery of separateness and physicality in a three-dimensional world with incremental time.** These two realms can also be referred to as the two sides of the veil. To travel between these two sides of the veil or two sides of the figure-eight infinity symbol, one must go through the mysterious zero point at the center, as I somehow did briefly today after the yoga session. And just to be clear, this negative and positive are not at all associated with judgments of good and bad. Both poles are equally divine. They simply offer differing ways of experiencing life and existence. I very much saw that this other universal space of consciousness is not better or worse than the one we here normally live in. Of course, many of those from this negative side who have experienced the positive feel like they would give up the challenges of this negative side of existence in an instant to bask in the flowing light and glory of the positive pole. But when I considered this myself today, it was very clear that is not what is meant to be for me and for most of us here. We are sacred pioneers of the divine who have both chosen and were sent here to explore entirely new ways of being, however full of challenges they may be. If everything is positive love and light all the time, the ways consciousness can explore itself are limited. By creating the negative, unconscious pole, the collective consciousness of All That Is has greatly expanded its ability to experience itself in the infinitude of existence.

And we here are the pioneers who on some deep level volunteered to go unconscious and experience many levels of separation in order to explore deep into this physical realm and to eventually help to bring divine consciousness back fully into the experiment. Yet it seems that **the negative side of existence ended up sometimes bringing us divine fragments who volunteered here to places of intense pain and suffering that the collective consciousness never even imagined existed. As the positive side now begins to focus its awareness back to the shadow experiment we co-created, there is a growing desire from beings on both sides of the veil to somehow transcend the pain and suffering here to find a new balance.** It is time now to harmonize and reunite aspects of the positive and negative poles, so that all consciousness can explore ever greater harmonies and mysteries without having to further spiral into pain and suffering. Wild stuff!!! On my bicycle ride home from this most beautiful, most intense Bikram session, I found myself thinking about how many people in their limited human consciousness don't feel that they are worthy of entering or even looking at this other amazing dimension of existence I had just visited. They don't even feel capable of connecting directly with highly expanded group souls, like those with whom I've been exploring recently and connected with so beautifully today. Yet I have no doubt that these beings and the divine life force of this other dimension are available to all and happy to work with any who open to them. I am one of a relatively small percentage living in this negative pole of existence who carries some conscious memory of the other pole, and who is here to invite any who are open and interested to explore together the infinite possibilities available to all souls or fragments of the divine everywhere. I want to invite all of my friends to open to the joys of exploring both sides of the veil. From as early as I can remember in this lifetime, I had conscious awareness of the interconnectedness of all beings, and in particular, of the heart/love energy which connects us all.

I now understand that the challenging part of me that wanted to be a savior simply wanted everyone to know how beautiful and loving we all are in our core. Yet it has been a long journey to learn how to share this in an empowering way with others. Only as I have opened consciously to ever deeper levels of energetic connection both within me and with all around me am I gradually coming to better understand how I can assist those interested to experience this amazing level of expanded love and consciousness that is available to all. I am excited now to put out the [Hidden Hand material](https://www.WantToKnow.info/secret_societies/deep_insider_creation_story) with some minimal commentary to help people understand that the viewpoint presented is yet one more fascinating perspective in the greater scheme of things. And though it has helped tremendously to expand my understanding, not everything about this material resonates with me. Hidden Hand's belief that the Earth will split into three differing dimensions to me is but a metaphor for what is already happening in our world. **Those like me who have found their way to live life here largely from a place of love and interconnectedness are already living in a kind of heaven on Earth. In contrast, those who see and experience largely negativity both in themselves and out in the world continue to create more of the same by allowing their deep negative beliefs to play out for them on this planet. They are living in a kind of self-created hell. So there is no need to split the Earth into separate planets. Each of us now live on the same physical planet, yet our experiences of life and reality here can be incredibly different. It's like we live in the same physical reality, but emotionally and spiritually we live in different worlds.** So I suspect the differing densities and positive and negative poles Hidden Hand talks about already exist here and now in this world in which we live. Parts of the Hidden Hand's Luciferian group soul seem to believe that there will actually be a critical moment (the harvest) in which there is a physical split between these densities and poles, and that parallel Earths will be created. Yet I see this as a desire for salvation/damnation at some point in the future which would only create further separation in this dimension.

Wild stuff! **What I know is that we are each somehow co-creating the reality in which we live in an ever evolving dance, as our deepest, sometimes [unconscious beliefs are reflected](https://www.WantToKnow.info/wingmakers#gratitude) and manifested out in our world. The more we choose to become conscious of our deep unconscious beliefs, the more choice we have in how we create our experience of the world, and the easier it is to transform both our lives and our world.** The Hidden Hand's group soul Lucifer seems to even have some souls believing consciously that they need to choose intense negativity in order to advance spiritually as a soul. I highly doubt this is true, yet believe that key people here may be convinced of this. They believe that to progress to the next level they have to embody the negative option by being \"bad.\" What a strange and funny game! I don't fully understand the logic of it, but I do sense a legitimate reason behind it all. In the greater scheme of things, I have no doubt that everything is in divine order. **With my deep, unwavering commitment to what's best for all beings, I choose not to take sides on the service to self versus service to others polarity. I live in service to all, which includes both self and others.** I clearly am aligned with helping myself and all around me who are open and interested to choose ever more love, connection, and life-affirming beliefs. And I am getting better all the time at not having judgment of those who are consciously or unconsciously choosing to explore separation and the negative. It's all a part of the grand cosmic dance. Thank you, Hidden Hand, for helping me to better understand this. I want to invite all in this world who are interested to connect directly with their higher selves, with supportive spirits and group souls from other dimensions, and even with the amazing love energies of the positive realm I visited today. We all have choice in every moment as to how and where we focus our consciousness.

I've listed several below with a brief description and some comments on how they expanded my consciousness. I also welcome hearing about any key books which have had a transformational impact and greatly helped to expand your awareness in your journey through this mysterious thing called life. The books and materials which have most powerfully affected me are *Life After Life*, *Holographic Universe*, *Far Journeys*, *Cosmic Journeys*, *Prism of Lyra*, *Trance Formation of America*, and the WingMakers and Hidden Hand materials. I'll also recommend another book, *Undefended Love*, which did not affect me as profoundly as above, but which is the best general guide I have seen yet for personal transformation. Happy reading! ***[Life After Life](http://www.amazon.com/Life-After-Investigation-Phenomenon--Survival-Bodily/dp/0062517392/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1337984395&sr=1-1)***** by Dr. Raymond Moody** This landmark book more than any other is credited with sparking global interest in the amazing field of near-death experiences (NDE). I came across the book at a critical moment in my life. At age 19 in 1977, I experienced my first spiritual crisis. I was agnostic at the time - not knowing whether God really existed or not. As a result of this crisis, for the first ever I sent out a sincere, heartfelt prayer to God asking if he/she/it really existed to give me some kind of clear sign. About a month or so after that earnest prayer, this breakthrough book - the first ever filled with people's descriptions of the incredible experiences they went through while being declared clinically dead - found its way to me. It was clearly the sign I had been looking for. This proved to me the existence of the afterlife and led to my first explorations into consciousness and expanded dimensions and realms. Just a couple months later, I experienced an amazing spiritual awakening where I felt like the crown of my head opened and all of the wisdom I had accumulated in past lifetimes poured through my head and into my being in an amazing spiritual download. Since *Life After Life* was published, many other great books have been written on this most intriguing and inspiring topic. So though it's a great read, it is not necessarily the best book in the field. As near-death experiences are so powerful in transforming awareness and even shifting the collective consciousness of our world, I've put together a special NDE section, which you can find at [this link](https://www.WantToKnow.info/nde/near-death-experiences-ndes). If you like this kind of stuff, I most highly recommend checking out the resources there. ***[Holographic Universe](http://www.amazon.com/The-Holographic-Universe-Revolutionary-Reality/dp/0062014102/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1337984447&sr=1-1)*** **by Michael Talbot** I was so thrilled on finding this beautiful book back in the late 1990s to find scientific validation for much of", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:insider__12_books_transformational.txt:0:c1ce4a0740ce", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 11597, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "insider__12_books_transformational.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "insider__12_books_transformational", "chunk_index": 1, "text": "the best book in the field.

Talbot (now deceased) is a master at bringing the worlds of science and spirituality. And his own personal story, included in the latter part of the book, is simply mind boggling. If you don't like scientific explanations (which are very well done), skip the first few chapters to get to the real juicy stuff. This landmark book beautifully depicts both scientifically and philosophically how everything is much more interconnected than we are led to believe. Using cutting-edge scientific theories and experiments related to the holographic nature of our minds and universe, Talbot shows how powerful our minds are in shaping the reality in which we live. Chapter four's amazing examples of miracle healing is especially engaging. Very well researched with lots of footnotes, I most highly recommend this awesome book. An excellent, seven-page summary is [available here](https://www.personalgrowthcourses.net/stories/talbot.universe_hologram). ***[Far Journeys](http://www.amazon.com/Far-Journeys-Robert-Monroe/dp/0385231822/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1337984481&sr=1-1)***** by Robert Monroe** Robert Monroe, the founder of the [Monroe Institute](http://www.monroeinstitute.org/), was one of the great consciousness pioneers of our time. In *Far Journeys*, his second of three books, he recounts his own personal journey of awakening. During a spontaneous out of body experience in his late 30s, he describes how he was absolutely terrified and struggled mightily to get back into his body. But after experiencing this six or seven times and coming back to normal reality each time without a problem, his curiosity eventually overtook his fear. Thus began an incredibly fascinating lifetime of exploration. Monroe's step-daughter is married to Joseph McMoneagle, one of the most accomplished remote viewers. I mentioned McMoneagle's excellent book, *[The Stargate Chronicles](http://www.amazon.com/The-Stargate-Chronicles-Joseph-McMoneagle/dp/1571742255/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1337985514&sr=8-1)*, in a previous message. Monroe worked closely with a number of CIA and intelligence agents, helping them to open to greater realities. From all of my research, I've found Monroe to have a very high level of integrity and to be one deeply dedicated to transforming our world for the good. *Far Journeys*, more than any other book, helped me to understand the fluidity of time and how our world of time and space is much more of a construct of the mind than a deeper reality. If you want to go on a journey deep into the mystical unknown with this intrepid explorer of consciousness, I most highly recommend this book. ***[Cosmic Journeys](http://www.amazon.com/Cosmic-Journeys-Out---Body-Explorations/dp/1571741232/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1337984516&sr=1-1)***** by Rosalind McKnight** I was so deeply inspired and transformed by *Far Journeys* that I", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:insider__12_books_transformational.txt:1:13e8a65f7f8b", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 11598, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "insider__12_books_transformational.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "insider__12_books_transformational", "chunk_index": 2, "text": "the good. *Far Journeys*, more than any other book, helped me to understand the fluidity of time and how our world of time and space is much more of a construct of the mind than a deeper reality.

I read both of Monroe's other books (good, but not as powerful as *Far Journeys*) and eventually found a book by a woman who was on his team of consciousness explorers, Rosalind McKnight. In *Cosmic Journeys*, McKnight recounts her amazing experiences upon joining Monroe's team in exploring out of body experiences use the advanced technology of binaural beats, a field of which Monroe is considered the founding pioneer. She traveled to far expanded realms of which she could never even have dreamed. Much of the book is transcripts of her sessions in Monroe's amazing laboratory. While *Far Journeys* is incredibly stimulating intellectually, *Cosmic Journeys* gives more of a heart and soul based description of incredibly profound and esoteric realms. McKnight states that \"every soul has its own special tune to play in the universal orchestra.\" This book excited me even more than *Far Journeys*, yet both had an incredibly profound impact on expanding my view of what is possible in our infinite universe. I highly recommend both of these consciousness-expanding books. **[*Prism of Lyra*](http://www.amazon.com/Prism-Lyra-Lyssa-Royal/dp/1891824872/ref=sr_1_5?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1337979300&sr=1-5) by Lyssa Royal and Keith Priest** Not at the level of the above books, nonetheless *Prism of Lyra* helped me tremendously in filling out the big picture of all that is going on in our universe. Being both a talented psychic and serious researcher, Royal has combined both these talents to give an amazingly coherent and sensible view of how this physical universe was formed and a history of the beings that inhabit it. This thought-provoking book also presents a plausible theory of the evolution of life both in the universe and on Earth. I don't resonate with everything presented in the book, especially the hierarchical depiction of levels of beings, but its message was most helpful in creating a more expanded perspective for myself of how life and our universe functions. And if you want a really fun and intriguing book of channeled material written by Royal exploring sexuality among varying ET species, [*Future Sex*](http://www.amazon.com/Future-Sex-Recover-Addiction-Monogamy/dp/0646051164/ref=sr_1_9?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1337979300&sr=1-9) is a great read. ***[Trance Formation of America](http://www.amazon.com/Trance-Formation-America-Cathy-OBrien/dp/0966016548/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1337980537&sr=8-1)***** by Cathy O'Brien and Mark Phillips** This disturbing book is not for the light of heart.

This book took me down the deepest, darkest parts of the rabbit hole and eventually led me to become somewhat of an expert on mind control programs which are an absolute key to the methods of control used by the hidden powers of our world. I only recommend this if you really want to know how deep it all goes and are prepared to be disturbed. For me, I do want to know, and I am using this information to expose all this is going on and help create a better world for all of us. If you suspect you might be a survivor of one of these programs, please don't read this book, as it could trigger suicide programming.

It is only 17 pages worth of written material, yet when I first read this material back in early 2001, it so profoundly transformed me that I broke down and cried. I reread it a few times a year even now and am invariable inspired anew. For links to this material and more on my highly intriguing experiences in exploring deep into it, [click here](https://www.WantToKnow.info/wingmakersorig/wingmakerschanges). The Hidden Hand material, though with significant weaknesses in my opinion, helped me more than any other to understand why there is so much negativity and suffering in our world. I do not resonate with the idea presented of a harvest, where all the good souls go off to a heavenly version of Earth, while the bad or mediocre souls have to stay here and suffer. It's the same old heaven and hell scenario religions have use for years to promote fear and obedience. Yet there is enough great stuff that I recommend this material with that caveat.

Full of warmth and humanity, this remarkable book helps us to see that the most powerful transformation happens when we are willing to face the fears and challenges that arise in ourselves and in our relationships with openness and vulnerability. Many specific, practical tools help to guide us towards richer, deeper relationships not only with our partners, but also with ourselves and with all around us. This book currently has 51 reader reviews and 49 of those are five stars on amazon.com. That is a testament to its quality. If you are ready to take the risks involved in being truly authentic with yourself and others, you will likely be very thankful to have this excellent guide at your side.

I was particularly stunned by David Wilcock's recent, very long essay that was incredibly revealing in exposing the depths of financial corruption. For those who haven't seen it and who have the time and interest, I believe Wilcock's essay at the link below is a deeper and more thorough picture of all the craziness going on here on planet Earth than I've ever seen. Warning that I'd guess it is about 60 pages long, but I felt every page was worth it. [http://www.divinecosmos.com/start-here/davids-blog/1023-financial-tyranny](http://www.divinecosmos.com/start-here/davids-blog/1023-financial-tyranny) Though I don't agree with everything he says, Wilcock presents solid, credible evidence (sometimes quite incredible!) for almost everything he covers on financial corruption and more. His careful research led me to dozens of amazingly revealing articles from the major media, which I've been able to use effectively on WantToKnow.info. If you'd like a preview of a message going out to the WTK list on Friday covering the huge $700 trillion (yes trillion = 1,000 billion) derivatives scam inspired largely by Wilcock's research, here's the link: [https://www.WantToKnow.info/banking_finance/derivatives_market_bubble_financial](https://www.WantToKnow.info/banking_finance/derivatives_market_bubble_financial) And an amazing and exciting article was just published today in the New York Times by a Goldman Sachs executive director who is resigning because he couldn't take the lack of integrity and huge amount of greed any more. Check it out and spread this article which shows how much things are changing. Here's the link: [http://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/14/opinion/why-i-am-leaving-goldman-sachs.html](http://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/14/opinion/why-i-am-leaving-goldman-sachs.html) I want to mention that I am skeptical of David Wilcock's claims (along with Ben Fulford, who I find has a great tendency to exaggerate) that we are going to see major arrests of top politicians around the globe soon. I'd be thrilled if it happens, but I'm not holding my breath. And though I am not a believer that we're going to see anything particularly outstanding on Dec. 21st of this year, I am very hopeful the an ever increasing number of people are awakening to the deeper realities, and that we will see major changes in the coming few years. Once winter solstice 2012 passes and people stop focusing on that as a date of salvation, we can really get down to the greater work of personal and global transformation in this ever-present sacred moment. People are waking up all over in ever greater numbers to the realization that the time is now and that we are the ones we've been waiting for.

First, a quote by Courtney Walsh that rings deep into my soul: \"Dear Human, You've got it all wrong. You didn't come here to master unconditional love. That is where you came from and where you'll return. You came here to learn personal love. Messy love. Sweaty love. Crazy love. Broken love. Whole love. Infused with divinity. Lived through the grace of stumbling. Demonstrated through the beauty of messing up. Often. You didn't come here to be perfect. You already are. You came here to be gorgeously human. Flawed and fabulous. And then to rise again into remembering. Love doesn't require the condition of perfection. It only asks that you show up. And do your best. That you stay present and feel fully. That you shine and fly, and laugh and cry, And hurt and heal, and fall and get back up, And play and work, and live and die In all the glory and in all the wonderful messiness that is YOU.\" Yes to the joys and challenges of being fully human!!! Thank you Courtney Walsh for this powerful reminder. For what I found to be an amazing and enlightening analysis of global geopolitics, [click here](http://www.gatheringspot.net/topic/general-discussion/assange-latin-america-defeat-elite). This essay shows how Latin America is playing a key, yet little-known role in transforming our world. And here's an awesome Rumi poem: **One, One, One** The lamps are different, But the Light is the same. So many garish lamps in the lamp shop of the tortured mind. Forget about them. Concentrate on the essence, concentrate on the Light within, In lucid bliss, calmly radiating its own holy fire. This Light streams toward you from all things, All people, all possible permutations of good, evil, thought, passion. The lamps are different, But the Light is the same. One matter, one energy, one Light, one Light-mind, Endlessly emanating all things. One turning and burning infinitely-faceted diamond. One, One, One. Ground yourself, strip yourself down, To blind loving silence. Stay there, until you see You are gazing at the Light With its own ageless eyes. Thank you, Rumi, for this most rich reminder. Could it be that we are all part of one great interconnectedness of being looking at itself through an infinite variety of eyes? To close this message, here is the inspiring parable of a little star who chooses to become human. **The Parable of the Little Star** Once upon a time in a grand spiral galaxy, there was a young, but bright little star among the many millions of radiant stars there.

To close this message, here is the inspiring parable of a little star who chooses to become human. **The Parable of the Little Star** Once upon a time in a grand spiral galaxy, there was a young, but bright little star among the many millions of radiant stars there. Little Star had lots of fun watching and learning from its local family of stars, and from all the other stars shining in the vastness of their glorious galaxy. One day as Little Star scanned the huge galaxy, it was strangely drawn to a small speck of a planet circling a distant golden sun. It saw that this dense, revolving globe was inhabited by very unusual life forms known as humans. They called their beautiful, blue-green planet Earth. Little Star was intrigued to see that these human beings experienced a truly wild, vivid, and unusual reality. Unlike star beings, they manifested in their reality as very dense forms of light called matter, with bodies made largely of a curious, soft substance called water encased in a thin skin. In these peculiar bodies in this very dense reality, Little Star was fascinated at how humans deeply immersed themselves in very intense and trying experiences for the purpose of learning from them. The many rich experiences of these human beings were very beautiful and loving at times, yet at other times they were quite ugly and even hateful. Most strange was that they learned from the bad experiences just as much as from the good ones, and sometimes even more. This mystifying reality intrigued Little Star greatly. The more it watched, the more it wished that it could experience life in this way. It seemed so very exotic and exciting. Little Star had hardly noticed that there was a small moon orbiting this beautiful planet. This moon being, however, had noticed Little Star's fascination with the Earth. On hearing Little Star's thoughts, the silvery moon reached through space and whispered softly to Little Star, \"I can help you learn what it is like to be a human.\" \"Really?!!!\" said little star in astonishment. \"Yes,\" said the moon being. \"I have the ability to insert star beings into a human body so you can feel what it is like to be a human. You can later return to your star self with much greater wisdom, having learned from being a physical human being in their dense light reality.\" \"How can I do that?\" Little Star asked. \"It's easy,\" said the moon. \"I will create a human child body for you to enter. You can then live as a human for one human cycle of life. After completing one lifetime there, you can choose to return to being a little star as before.\" This idea intrigued Little Star greatly. Just watching life on Earth was fun, and Little Star", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:insider__12_little_star_parable.txt:1:e713e667ddea", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 11606, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "insider__12_little_star_parable.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "insider__12_little_star_parable", "chunk_index": 2, "text": "being a physical human being in their dense light reality.\" \"How can I do that?\" Little Star asked. \"It's easy,\" said the moon. \"I will create a human child body for you to enter. You can then live as a human for one human cycle of life. After completing one lifetime there, you can choose to return to being a little star as before.\" This idea intrigued Little Star greatly. Just watching life on Earth was fun, and Little Star even learned a few things. \"But to be able to experience life in a physical light body ...,\" thought Little Star, \"what a great way to have lots of new experiences and learn many new things like never before.\" \"But how can I learn if I always know that I am really a star being?\" Little Star asked. \"I would know that I wasn't really a human.\" \"Don't worry,\" said the moon being. \"I will arrange so that you completely forget who you really are during your time on Earth. That way you'll think that you are merely human and be able to gain more from the experience.\" \"That sounds like fun!\" said Little Star. \"After you insert me into a human body, will I will return to being a star at the end of my human life?\" asked Little Star. \"Of course you will, unless you like it so much that you wish to play the game again when you're done.\" \"Yea! I'm excited!\" said Little Star. \"When can I start?\" So the moon compacted and compressed the essence of Little Star and inserted it into a human child body that was soon to be born. As agreed, Little Star became a star human who soon forgot who it really was as it began to experience the many rich aspects of human existence. The little star human went on to become a human husband and a father. He fought in war, fell in love, experienced jealousy, hatred, pain, joy, anger, and much, much more - all of the rich experiences that humans face during their lives. Yet as with all human life, it eventually was time for the game to end. Having forgotten his true star nature for his entire human life, the little star human found himself on his death bed awaiting with fear what was to come. At the time of his death, the little star human left its human body and rose in spiritual human form to meet his fate. He was relieved to soon be met by a very bright being he believed to be God, since he still had no memory of his true self. The little star human asked this being of great light, \"Are you God?\" This being of great light was actually the moon being, yet it craftily reflected back what the little star human saw and answered, \"I am who", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:insider__12_little_star_parable.txt:2:3d63cb502241", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 11607, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "insider__12_little_star_parable.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "insider__12_little_star_parable", "chunk_index": 3, "text": "left its human body and rose in spiritual human form to meet his fate.

Are you ready?\" asked the moon being. With some apprehension, the star human nodded that he was. They then saw in front of them in vivid detail all of the life experiences that the star human had ever lived played out in what seemed like an instant. Some experiences were loving, kind, and good, while other experiences were filled with death, hate, anger, and greed. The negative experiences made the little star human sad and regretful for many of the things he had done. Not remembering his true star nature, he believed this human existence reflected all of who he was. He felt sorry that he had wasted much of his life on Earth with such ugly experiences. The moon being said to the the forlorn star human, \"You can have another chance. Would you like to go back and to live another life on Earth to make up for the many mistakes you made?\" \"Oh yes please!\" said the lost and confused little star being, not realizing that there might be another choice. \"I need to learn to be a more loving human being.\" \"So be it,\" said the moon being. \"I will erase all memory of this lifetime for you and reinsert you back into a new life form on Earth. You can almost certainly do a better job this time.\" \"I will! Thank you Lord for giving me another chance,\" said the remorseful little star human. And so it was done. And in this way, Little Star was kept trapped by the clever moon in a seemingly endless loop of reincarnation for many, many lifetimes on Earth, never remembering his true heritage. Only after growing weary of so many lifetimes did the little star human begin to wonder if there wasn't something more. Finally, feeling particularly sad and introspective after a harsh experience in one lifetime, he sent out a silent plea for help and guidance to find deeper wisdom. At the exact moment the little star human sent out this plea, Little Star's family began to wonder what had become of their son and brother.

At the exact moment the little star human sent out this plea, Little Star's family began to wonder what had become of their son and brother. Because star beings know that all beings in their true essence are integral parts of the One, it wasn't hard to trace Little Star's essence and find him. When Little Star's family found him stuck in cycles of reincarnation on Earth, they were greatly troubled. Seeing the moon being's involvement, they approached and said to the somber moon, \"Why have you trapped our beloved in this terrible place for so long?\" The shrewd moon being calmly replied, \"I have not trapped him. He has trapped himself. He asked for this experience. The choice to enter this reality was of his own free will, and each choice to continue these cycles of life was also his.\" \"Yes, but he has completely forgotten his true family and no longer remembers what a truly beautiful and radiant star being he really is,\" his family retorted. The moon simply replied, \"Little Star agreed to all this when the game began. It has always been his choice to continue his journey of lifetimes on Earth. He will let me know when he is ready to leave.\" Not satisfied with this answer, Little Star's family called a special meeting of all their star friends to present their predicament. As a result, they sent out a call for wise star beings to volunteer to incarnate on Earth. The many star beings who answered the call hoped to reawaken Little Star to his true heritage and to break the cycle of incarnations that he had become trapped in for so long. As it was entirely possible that any of these wise star beings might also become trapped in this dense reality, only the strongest of them volunteered for this difficult mission. They saw that the crafty moon being used many tricks to keep star humans confused and in fear, so that they, too, might not remember their real heritage. Yet slowly and with great difficulty, these volunteers began to interact with and challenge each other on Earth in ways that awakened not only themselves and Little Star, but also many other little star beings that had become trapped in the Earth reality game. As Little Star and the others slowly began to recognize who they were and remember their true families, they gradually became anxious to return home and to become the bright spiritual beings that they had always been.

They longed to be welcomed with open arms by all of their loved ones. Little Star and many others then chose and were finally granted permission to leave Earth, thankful for the wisdom gained during their time there as humans. Yet they also felt sad for the many that remained. Going home to be with his loving family of star beings, Little Star was in heaven! He was so glad to remember who he really was and to play again with his radiant family. Yet he was also thankful for all of the knowledge and wisdom he had gained in his great adventures on Earth. After some rich time playing and learning back in his bright star reality, Little Star felt it was time to go back to Earth. He called together a group of friends to help all the little stars on Earth awaken. Many little stars who had already shared his experience of being trapped and then graduating from the Earth reality also joined in choosing to return as volunteers. And so it was that eventually, all little star beings who were trapped on Earth began to remember who they really were, who they really are. In the end, which was actually but another beginning, all were awakened and could then choose to stay and play consciously on Earth, or to return and explore other fascinating aspects of themselves as the brilliant star beings that they always were. Please note that the above parable is a significantly edited version of a story recommended to me on the website Godlike Productions posted by an anonymous user. As it struck a chord inside of me, I decided to edit the story and include it here for you. I hope you've enjoyed all the inspiring pieces here as much as I have.

Our real home is within each of us and follows us wherever we go.\" * ~~ Anita Moorjani on her profound near-death experience in her book *Dying to Be Me* Hey wonderful 'In the Know' friends, I recently finished reading the most inspiring book I've read in years, *[Dying to Be Me](http://www.amazon.com/Dying-Be-Me-Journey-Healing/dp/1401937519/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1343877883&sr=1-1&keywords=dying+to+be+me)* by Anita Moorjani. **Anita experienced what may be the most incredible miracle healing yet in the medical records.** She went through death and came back to share with us the mind and heart boggling wisdom she gained while on the other side. Reading Anita's powerfully transformative near-death experience in this soulful book transported me to another magical reality which beautifully helped to put everything into a deeper, fuller perspective. After years of battling with cancer, Anita's body had become quite emaciated by 2006. On the morning of February 2nd that year, her body took a rapid turn for the worse. After being rushed to the emergency room, the doctors informed her husband and family that because her vital organs were failing or had already shut down, she would not likely live more than another day or two. Though she was unconscious and in a coma, Anita witnessed everything the doctors said and everything that was happening around her for a while that morning from a place outside of her body. She then had the thrill of being transported to the other side of the veil, where she had a magical, healing connection with her deceased father and other amazing beings of love and light. Anita's time on the other side was filled with profound experiences of love and realization, which she describes with deep beauty and wisdom in her moving book. Eventually she was given the choice to stay there on the other side of the veil, in which case her Earth-bound body would die, or to go back to finish the life work she had yet to complete. Only after she was assured that her body would heal rapidly did Anita decide to come back. And come back she did - in a very big way. Her body had been riddled with stage 4B lymphoma (the worst stage possible), her swollen lymph nodes like golf balls sticking out of her emaciated body. Yet **within days of returning from her timeless journey to the other side, the tumors melted away and medical tests showed that her cancer was completely gone. The doctors could not believe it. ** With", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:insider__12_near_death_experience_anita_moorjani.txt:0:745a4c9a5210", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 11612, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "insider__12_near_death_experience_anita_moorjani.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "insider__12_near_death_experience_anita_moorjani", "chunk_index": 1, "text": "heal rapidly did Anita decide to come back.

Yet though her body had returned to normal, her inner life had radically transformed in miraculous ways. The wisdom she shares in her beautiful book is some of the deepest I have ever read. I can't recommend this profound book highly enough. *\"I saw my life intricately interwoven into everything I'd known so far. My experience was like a single thread woven through the huge and complexly colorful images of an infinite tapestry.

While I was in the middle of reading this amazing book, Sheila Linn, a wonderful friend who is on this \"In the Know\" list, by chance contacted me seeking information for a book she and her husband Denny are writing on near-death experiences. As she knows I have great interest in NDEs, Sheila put me in touch with one of the foremost researchers in the NDE field, [Kenneth Ring](https://www.WantToKnow.info/a-kenneth-ring-you-never-recover-your-original-self). Shortly afterward, Ken and I got together for lunch and shared an incredibly rich conversation about a wide range of fascinating topics. Ken is in email communication with Anita and was delighted to meet her on her recent visit to the US. He suggested that I get in touch with her, too. I've done that now, and she has given me permission to summarize her book. Yea!!! I very much look forward to doing that as soon as I get some time. I'll let you now when the summary is ready. Another member of this list, my good friend William Van Vechten, has been doing some great volunteer work for PEERS in recent months. One of the things he did was to format all of the key messages that I've sent in the past to the \"In the Know\" list, dating back to late 2008. I then posted them all and made an index.", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:insider__12_near_death_experience_anita_moorjani.txt:1:51aaa87f6288", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 11613, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "insider__12_near_death_experience_anita_moorjani.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "insider__12_near_death_experience_anita_moorjani", "chunk_index": 2, "text": "that as soon as I get some time.

This inspiring book is just one of many, many exciting and transformational happenings taking place now on our planet. What a fun and wild time to be alive! Thank you all for joining me in this profound journey of co-creation. I'll end this message with a quote from another woman who had a powerful near-death experience. The quote is taken from Kenneth Ring's book on NDEs titled [*Lessons From the Light*](http://www.amazon.com/Lessons-Light-Learn-Near-death-Experience/dp/1930491115/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1343926051&sr=1-1&keywords=lessons+from+the+light+ring): \"*I used to think I was the artist when I was painting. I now see, since my NDE, that I am only the brush, my life experiences are the paint, my life is the painting, and the world is the studio with love as the subject.*\" ~~ Peggy Holladay Wishing you and all of us abundant love, inspiration, and joy, Fred August 2, 2012 P.S.

Joseph McMoneagle was the first military man recruited into the U.S. government's secret remote viewing program, which started in the early 1970s. His intriguing autobiography \"The Stargate Chronicles: Memoirs of a Psychic Spy\" is not only extremely revealing about how the Stargate program was run and its significance, it is a great and fun read filled with rich stories and vulnerable sharing of Joe's personal life. As you read, you can feel how this honest man is sharing from the heart his own trials and tribulations as he strives against all odds to do the right thing for his country. If you want to understand the subtle complexities of the secret world of the shadow government and learn about this most fascinating program, I highly recommend this mind-expanding book. McMoneagle eventually married Robert Monroe's step-daughter and worked closely with Monroe, so you also get an inside view of the Monroe Institute and it's secret connection with the government remote viewing program. You can find McMoneagle's great book online at this link. We have two excellent videos on remote viewing on our website. One is a four-minute news clip showing a remote viewer in action. The second is an intriguing documentary featuring Ingo Swann and other top remote viewers describing their work on film. Fascinating stuff. You can access both of these videos at this link: [https://www.WantToKnow.info/mind_control/remote_viewing_video_documentary](https://www.WantToKnow.info/mind_control/remote_viewing_video_documentary) Joe McMoneagle is generally considered the best of all military remote viewers, yet the most acclaimed remote viewer ever is Ingo Swann, who was able to read files locked in completely secure safes with an astonishing degree of accuracy. Swann wrote many books on remote viewing and related topics. Yet interestingly, when he wrote a tell-all autobiography, no one would publish it. So he self-published it. Yet apparently some group quickly bought up all copies he printed, so that to this day this amazing book is extremely hard to find, and quite expensive if you do find a copy. Only after an extensive search using my awesome network of researchers, including many on this list (special thanks to Gabriele), I was able to get a full pdf copy of the book and post it online. If any of you are interested, you can find it at: [https://www.WantToKnow.info/ufos/penetration.ingo_swann.pdf](https://www.WantToKnow.info/ufos/penetration.ingo_swann.pdf) I also want to recommend a highly inspiring seven-minute video titled \"The Gentle Art of Blessing\" at [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WegAgepCYfo](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WegAgepCYfo).

For those interested in more on McMoneagle and his remote viewing of Mars, here are a couple of links and paragraphs about this. [http://www.firedocs.com/remoteviewing/joe/mindtrek/mindtrek-review1.html](http://www.firedocs.com/remoteviewing/joe/mindtrek/mindtrek-review1.html) - review of McMoneagle's earlier book \"Mind Trek\" Like many other remote viewers, McMoneagle claims to have had occasional contacts with alien beings and other dimensions of existence and has come to see reality as far more complex and malleable than it appears when viewed solely from within the physical context. \"On the other side of physical reality there is no logic because it isn't necessary for understanding,\" he writes. \"In the nonphysical universe there is only knowing or truth... Humanity simply straddles the dividing line. There may be other creatures which do the same, so we may not be as unique as we think we are.\" In a chapter titled \"Another World,\" McMoneagle tells what happened when, in the mid-1980s, he turned his remote viewing gaze toward the mysterious pyramidal structures on Mars, which some researchers regard as evidence that the planet was formerly inhabited. \"These targets were certainly not of my choosing,\" says McMoneagle, \"because, as usual, I was being kept totally blind to what they were throughout the targeting and information collection process.\" His impressions of the targets suggested a civilization destroyed by some sort of cosmic catastrophe, perhaps a million years ago. [http://www.mceagle.com/remote-viewing/pub/media/magicalblend9701.html](http://www.mceagle.com/remote-viewing/pub/media/magicalblend9701.html) - An interview with Joseph McMoneagle: Interviewer: \"In Mind Trek you relate a mind-bending experience about a remote viewing experiment involving NASA photos of Mars. Could you tell us about that?\" Joseph McMoneagle: \"At the Monroe Institute in Virginia they locked me up in the windowless remote viewing room to ensure I didn't see who was bringing the targets. A man from NASA arrived, carrying a sheet of paper with seven sets of coordinates. They read the target coordinates to me, and I started describing this pyramid, which I assumed to be in Egypt. But it didn't make sense to me, because I was describing corridors and rooms that I knew didn't exist in the Egyptian pyramids. I described all seven targets in detail: the first six correctly. The man from NASA was absolutely blown away. Only he knew what was at each of these locations.

It's titled \"Tuning In: Spirit Channelers in America.\"\n\nI am generally skeptical of channelers, as often their own personalities to a greater or lesser extent color and dilute the message of the entity being channeled. However, the messages in this film were really right on for me. Many rich, profound, and transformative concepts along with powerful information for living a fully empowered and loving life. If you get time to watch it, I'd love to hear your thoughts.\n\n[**http://nhne-pulse.org/documentary-tuning-in**](http://nhne-pulse.org/documentary-tuning-in)\n\nI learned of this spiritual channeling documentary from the excellent email list of David Sunfellow of [NewHeavenNewEarth](http://nhne-pulse.org/).

To subscribe to NHNE's news list, send an email message to: [nhnenews-subscribe@yahoogroups.com](mailto:nhnenews-subscribe@yahoogroups.com).\n\nAnd for those who like books, the best book of spiritually channeled material I've ever read is *Seth Speaks*, [available here](http://www.amazon.com/Seth-Speaks-Eternal-Validity-Soul/dp/1878424076/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1353393836&sr=1-1&keywords=seth+speaks).

Hopefully all of you have seen or at least know about *Thrive*, the carefully researched documentary which has opened the eyes of countless people to all that is going on behind the scenes in our world. I've seen it now three times. **I am thrilled that the film is now available for free viewing at [this link](http://www.thrivemovement.com/the_movie).** I was very impressed with all of the time, care, and money that was put into this documentary by Foster and Kimberly Gamble. I have a few serious reservations about *Thrive*, which I'll describe later, yet overall I think the 132-minute film is a very positive contribution to the transformation of our world. I'm personal friends with Gary Malkin, the amazing, Emmy-award-winning composer who wrote the musical score for *Thrive*. Gary told me that in all his career he had never had such a wonderful, rich time collaborating on a musical score as with the Gambles. So when my friend Gabriele from Australia (a wonderful member of this \"In the Know\" list) told me about a month ago that she would be seeing the Gambles on her visit to the U.S., I immediately asked if I might possibly join her. I had been in email contact with Foster previously. He was very appreciative of my work and expressed interest in getting together, but was too busy at the time to make it happen. Thankfully, both Foster and Gabriele were happy to have me join them for her visit to the Gamble's home. Spending an afternoon and evening with Foster and getting to know Kimberly, both Gabriele and I were most thoroughly impressed with their incredible welcoming and warmth, their impressive knowledge of all that is going on, and their deep, unwavering commitment to help transform our world. **The sense of love and warmth around this couple was most infectious.** And their beautiful home has all kinds of great architecture and gardens with special attention given to feng shui and sacred geometry, particularly in the most amazing fountain outside their front door. I was incredibly impressed with Foster's stories of his personal transformation and what led him to create *Thrive*. He is an incredibly deep spiritual being who has a clear connection with guidance from other realms which has helped him tremendously his whole life. And there are some beautiful synchronicities around his connecting with Kimberly and how they came to birth *Thrive* together. I was truly in awe of how deep our connection and conversation went.

I felt their rich, loving energy with me for days after I got back home from this profound visit. It's exciting just to know now that they are an integral part of the [transformation team](https://www.transformationteam.net) of our planet. **It was quite fortuitous that just hours before our visit, the Gambles had launched the awesome new \"solutions hub\" of their website. **Focusing on 12 defined sectors of life and bringing people together locally around these issues, the solutions hub already has nearly 100 groups from around the world working together for transformation. I think this is a great model which will hopefully spread and inspire people to take concrete actions to make a difference. I invite you to explore what they are doing with this on their website at [this link](http://www.thrivemovement.com/solutions-hub). I will add here that I am hoping to soon develop several forums for PEERS and WantToKnow.info which will allow supporters from around the world to communicate, share information, and inspire each other to make a difference in our world. I plan to have one forum designated specifically for members of this \"In the Know\" list. I will let you know once we've got that going. Thank you to Foster and Kimberly for helping to inspire this idea. So I want you all to know that I found the Gambles to be some of the most wonderful people I've ever met, of the highest integrity, and true movers and shakers for transformation on our planet. At the same time, as I mentioned earlier, **I do have my reservations about *Thrive*, which I feel it is important to share with you. ** The fact that David Icke is prominently featured in *Thrive* is my biggest regret. Icke presents very well in the film and gives valuable information. From my own experience and that of friends of mine who are friends of his, I know that Icke has a good heart and the best of intentions. Yet as some of you know, he believes that many of our world leaders are half alien beings who must drink freshly slaughtered baby blood on a regular basis in order to keep their human form. I know this will turn off many who investigate Icke's work in any depth, as he talks about this quite often. I also felt that the documentary was too long and loaded with too much depressing information, even though I know almost all of it is true. I give the film about a 95% on accuracy as far as facts presented, yet I would", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:insider__12_thrive_documentary_gamble_foster_kimberly.txt:1:7ea4debbde04", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 11621, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "insider__12_thrive_documentary_gamble_foster_kimberly.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "insider__12_thrive_documentary_gamble_foster_kimberly", "chunk_index": 2, "text": "drink freshly slaughtered baby blood on a regular basis in order to keep their human form.

I give the film about a 95% on accuracy as far as facts presented, yet I would have loved more inspiration mixed with the depressing news in the long middle section. *Thrive* also tends to place all the blame for our problems on the global elite, which I believe can easily lead to more polarization and hatred rather than less in our world. Because of these and other reasons, the Gamble's personal friend John Robbins (author of *Diet for a New America*) ended up spearheading a campaign in which 10 of the presenters in the film formally distanced themselves from the film. You can read his letter regarding this at [this link](http://www.thrivemovement.com/john-robbins-critique-of-thrive-movie-humanity-and-sanity). Though I think some of John's criticisms of the documentary are valid, others are clearly off base. I am particularly sad that he started a movement against the documentary without even consulting with his friend Foster before doing so. Foster told me that this was very painful for him, particularly as he invited John and others to view *Thrive* before it was released. Overall, though I do find the documentary has its weaknesses, I totally trust and support the Gambles, and I believe *Thrive* and especially the movement it is creating are valuable contributions to the transformation of our world. Switching to another topic, you may or may not be aware that there are many audio and video interviews of me on the Internet, some of which you can [find here](https://www.google.com/search?num=10&q=%22fred%20burks%22&um=1&ie=UTF-8&tbo=u&tbm=vid&source=og&sa=N&tab=wv&ei=rqLiT6aHBISi2wXziN3cCw).

Wishing you and all of us abundant love, inspiration, and joy, Fred June 21, 2012 **I Promised You Love** My dearest child, Above all else, I desire for You to know how deeply, eternally, and unconditionally I Love You. You are infinitely precious to me, and the Love I have for You is uniquely Yours. Nobody else has exactly the relationship to me that You do, and this makes You irreplaceably special. To me, You are a treasure beyond price. Whatever else You may think of what you see or experience, please always remain open to the warm feeling of Love in Your heart. In the end, the one eternal answer is Love. Love is what helps You feel more deeply connected to Your inner self, and through that core, the inner selves of all who are around You. Through the connections of Love, I have meaning in Your world. **Through these connections, You heal the deep wound across creation that is Separation.** **I wish to take a moment now to apologize to You for Separation.** When You came into being, I never meant for You to feel Separate from me, nor from those around You. You were born to provide a unique experience of Existence through Your own special Lens, but more in the sense of those in the eyes of a fly that work in unison to create the whole picture. You were meant to be an individual, yes, but as one aspect of a unified whole. Some level of boundaries were necessary for You to individuate, but these divisions are illusory and were never intended to be mistaken for real. Yet for reasons as varied as each one of You, my children, these illusions gained power over You. They created in You a feeling of being cut off from me, from Your siblings, and, most tragically, from Your own Divine core. And since this Separation prevents You from feeling Your own core self, You instead feel the Void, leaving You vulnerable to the hurtful desperation of emptiness inside. This causes You immense pain, which causes me pain, as well. When You were first created, I promised You Love. I promised that I would always honor You and called for You to be one within me. Yet when the Separation arose, I didn't dispel its hurtful delusions. I didn't want to interfere with Your progression and risk destroying Your individuation in the process.

Perhaps that was wrong, or perhaps it was a necessary process for You to grow into the beautifully strong and resilient soul You are. Regardless, I see the pain that this Separation has caused, and for that I am immensely sorry. I promised You Love, but instead You felt loneliness and pain. I wanted to embrace You in unity, but allowed You to feel Separate and powerless. If You have it in Your heart to forgive me, I ask that You please allow forgiveness to send away that pain, and replace it with a resonance of my Love for You. No matter Your answer, I want You to know that I forgive You for every harm You may ever have caused Yourself or another, because I know that such sins arise only from this feeling of Separation. I also wish to ask You to please forgive Your siblings for any harm they cause, because they also act in response to this Void inside that they never asked for, and also do not fully understand. **Please work to prevent harm and heal what has been done wrong, but if You can, do so through a labor of Love for all involved. Even if you can't always voice the Love you feel in your heart, it will help clear away the Separation from around their own hearts,** helping them have a new opportunity to make things right. Their choices remain their own, but your Love will help me complete the circle that encompasses You all, sealing our family with the healing light of unity. I ask You to practice this Lovingkindness for me, because You are the expression of my power in Your world. **I can Love each one of You wholly and completely, but You must forge your own connections among one another to strengthen the web of life in which you each are a nexus point of pure and shining light.** This is why You, personally, are so vitally important.

And do you want to better understand and transform the fears and challenges of our world in these wild and unpredictable times?

I am so moved by this course. It is a WEALTH of unlimited possibility. Everywhere I turn another link, another thought provoking tool!!! And it appears endless. I am deeply grateful to have found you. * ~ Alison C. **The mind and heart expanding Transformation Course brings together the best of the Internet to inspire and educate you in a dynamic and powerful way.** Balancing explorations into both the light and the shadows -- into both highly inspiring material and insightful information on all that is being hidden from the public -- the journey through the course will expand your awareness and provide practical tools enabling you to better create the life and world you want. *I'm an entirely different person now from when I began the Transformation Course. My consciousness is expanding in many ways. Working out my intentions has brought me tools that are helping me to create a new experience of the hologram. I wouldn't change a thing about the course. It is pure, inspired genius of heart and mind.* ~ Vimala The course covers a rich variety of life topics masterfully woven together. Course lessons will deepen your insight, expand your horizons, and embolden you to step ever more fully into your magnificence. Each of the 21 information-packed lessons ([click here](https://www.transformationteam.net/transformationcourseoverview) to see lesson titles and topics) takes from one to two hours to complete.

My new attitude is already starting to pay huge dividends, and I am eternally grateful. * ~ David J. A few people have even sent messages saying that the Transformation Course helped to save their lives. One man's life had gradually been falling to pieces. As his mental abilities deteriorated for reasons doctors could not explain or understand, he lost his job, his wife divorced him, and he was looking at a very grim future. In [lesson 10](https://www.transformationteam.net/ttcourse/tc10a) on health, he learned about the dangers of the artificial sweetener aspartame and immediately quit drinking the large amounts of diet soft drinks to which he was accustomed. Once he stopped, his life dramatically changed for the better. And here's another: * I think you literally saved my life. A couple years ago I started poking my nose into worldly affairs on the web. The more I poked, the more peace and serenity left me. My friends and family got really tired of listening to me. Next they'd run if they saw me. It was a tight race to see which would be my demise - fear or friend with gun. A week before finding the course, I said a prayer asking for a solution to the havoc caused by my search for knowledge. Not sure how I spied it, but the transformation course shined its light and I knew this was for me. Prayer answered. Thank you!* ~ Kate Q. **Almost every one of the hundreds who have completed the course since it was launched in 2007 have been most thankful.** Though offered free of charge, we have received over $25,000 in donations from grateful course participants and graduates. And the abundance of supportive comments written demonstrate the transformative power of this course. *When I started the Transformation Course I couldn't possibly have known how powerful this experience would be! For the first time in my life I know exactly what I want from life. All of the topics are very close to my heart, and I find great motivation in studying.

I invite you read what many others have had to say about the course at [this link](https://www.transformationteam.net/appreciations). Though the course will take an investment of your time, those who have put in the effort say it was well worth it. And for those who don't have time for the course, consider at least exploring the two most popular lessons, [lesson three](https://www.transformationteam.net/ttcourse/ttcourse03a) on personal responsibility and [lesson 20](https://www.transformationteam.net/ttcourse/trfc20a) on going beyond duality. *A few days after I did lesson three, my dear husband and I had a heartfelt, life-changing conversation filled with honesty and transparency. We finally both had the courage to explore some of our deepest needs and found out that we were each wrong about the other's opinions and feelings about those needs. It was amazing, and I KNOW without a doubt that had I not found this course, this conversation would not have come to the peaceful and loving end (and new beginning!) that it did. For that alone, I am so grateful. The journey through this course has been so deeply personal, yet so profoundly universal. I have never before felt so much a part of the whole. * ~ Erika **Once you complete the course, you can choose to become part of the Transformation Team**, where you can meet and communicate with other members, post articles, and lots more on our community networking portal.

Several of these were thanks to the awesome help of volunteer William Van Vechten, who loves our work. As he knows how to code, William put together both a [banking corruption information center](https://www.WantToKnow.info/bankingfactsinformationcorruption) and a [truth videos](https://www.WantToKnow.info/truthvideos) webpage we've been wanting for a long time. We also added 11 great new topics to our [news article index page](https://www.WantToKnow.info/indexnewsarticles). And we now have over 5,000 highly revealing news article summaries in our excellent [news database](https://www.WantToKnow.info/newsarticles). Another important addition thanks to our tech wiz Andrey's capable assistance is a great WTK [readers forum](https://www.WantToKnow.info/c/forum) where any of our readers can post articles and leave comments on any post there. Though it's off to a slow start with about 70 members and 160 topics posted at the end of the year, we're hopeful that this section will blossom and bring lots of interest in addition to presenting some useful information. Next year, we hope to make it possible for any who sign up to comment on regular WTK pages. This could substantially increase interest in the site. We continue to get lots of supportive and grateful feedback on our websites, email lists, and online courses. Here is a further sampling of the many wonderful emails of support we received this year. \"This course is amazing and has definitely changed my life. The trees are greener, the colours of butterflies are stronger, sounds are more sharp and clear. For the first time in my life I can sing without going off tune. My eyesight has improved, and I can stay calm and not react when someone is rude or insults me. The discoveries I have made about myself are too numerous to count. I don't earn a lot of money, but have set up a monthly donation. This is probably the most important donation I have ever made, as I feel the course has changed my life. Thank you so much. I feel your love and send sacred love to you all.\" ~~ Julie W. on the [Transformation Course](https://www.transformationteam.net), July 11, 2012 \"Thanks for everything you've done and continue to do via this site as well as the others associated with this one.

All but 6% of this came in the form of donations from generous supporters. The number of individuals making monthly contributions also increased a dramatic 68% from 57 in 2011 to 96 this year, while the number of caring individuals who made one or more donations during the year increased by an impressive 20% to 504. While many other nonprofits are still struggling financially, PEERS is most thankful to have such strong support. Our total expenses for the year were $47,651, up 19% from 2011. This was due largely to a 12% increase in compensation to Executive Director Fred Burks and to the additional taxes PEERS must pay, as Fred was hired on as a full-time employee this year at a rate of $27,000 per year. Even with this increase in expenses, PEERS ended up $9,695 in the black for the year of 2012. As a result, we are quite pleasantly surprised that PEERS now has $32,123 in total equity. Our two major expenses last year were $26,500 to Fred for his continued excellent management of PEERS, and $13,100 for Tod's quality weekly news summaries. Another $1,740 went to our web wizard Andrey for his brilliant and highly useful technical support. The remaining $6,311 went to pay Internet expenses, PayPal fees, government taxes and fees, insurance, and more for running the websites and nonprofit organization.

PEERS ended the year with liabilities of $1,758 resulting from taxes not due until January 2013. All donations were unrestricted. We had a net gain for 2012 of $9,695. We are extremely grateful to all of our caring contributors who so generously supported us, especially in these challenging times. **Transforming Our World Together With You** Our world is rapidly changing and transforming with each passing year. People are waking up around the globe and wanting to make a difference. The banking scandals, populist movements around the world, and much more have opened the eyes of many people to deeper, previously hidden levels of what is happening in our world. And people all over seem to be awakening to deeper spiritual realities and to our common humanity. It's an exciting time to be alive! We believe that PEERS is at the forefront of a grand movement to transform our world into a more caring and loving place for all people to live. Thanks so much to all involved with PEERS for your invaluable support in this most noble endeavor. We enter the year 2013 full of excitement at the possibilities of ever greater transformation of our world through our work and the work of our supporters and so many others who are coming together for the betterment of all in our world. \"I have been subscribing to your Peers list for some time now and always enjoy the tone of what you post.

Apparently this is quite a common way of getting government resolutions to take effect quickly. After reading the information in a *Tucson Weekly* article at [this link](http://www.tucsonweekly.com/TheRange/archives/2013/03/06/if-youre-freaking-out-about-martial-law-calm-down), I did a Google search on \"an emergency is hereby declared to exist\" and found 1,120,000 results. On checking them, most of the first few were added on to relatively mundane resolutions and laws. This has been common practice for many years. Sorry about raising the alarm. This shows how we can sometimes overreact and strange coincidences are sometimes nothing more thant that. I leave the original article I wrote below for those who might be interested. Take care. Dear 'In the Know' friends, **I received some very important information today on what looks like a secret declaration of martial law in Tucson, Arizona.** I feel it is vitally important that this information gets out and that the emergency declaration which appears to have been secretly inserted by Mayor Rothschild be revoked as soon as possible. Please forward this to all who care once you've finished reading. Resolution 22006 was adopted on Feb. 20, 2013 by Tucson, Arizona Mayor Jonathan Rothschild and the Tucson city council. To see the resolution on the city website, [click here](http://www.tucsonaz.gov/sirepub/cache/2/yek3m3jnigjdtu45i2os21ur/510635903112013013628744.PDF). On the surface, the resolution appears to just strengthen the ties between the city and its Davis-Monthan Air Force Base, which provides jobs for nearly 13,000 military and civilian employees. Yet there is more. The reason I state this all likely happened secretly, is that if you look at the [original proposal](http://www.tucsonaz.gov/sirepub/cache/2/yek3m3jnigjdtu45i2os21ur/510635803112013015601305.PDF), you will see that Section 2 and 3 were not included. The final resolution ends by stating in the added Section 3, \"whereas it is necessary for the preservation of the peace, health and safety of the City of Tucson that this Resolution become immediately effective, **an emergency is hereby declared to exist and this Resolution shall be effective immediately upon its passage and adoption.\"** I suspect these two sections may have been secretly added without even city council members knowing. As most of you know, once an emergency has been declared by a head of government, laws have been enacted which give special powers to the one in charge. As [stated in Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_of_emergency), \"A state of emergency is a governmental declaration which usually suspends a few normal functions of the executive, legislative and judicial powers... It can also be used as a rationale for suspending rights and freedoms, even if guaranteed under the constitution. Such declarations", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:insider__13-tucson-emergency-secret-martial-law.txt:0:bc6893e3a5a1", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 11638, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "insider__13-tucson-emergency-secret-martial-law.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "insider__13-tucson-emergency-secret-martial-law", "chunk_index": 1, "text": "city council members knowing.

It can also be used as a rationale for suspending rights and freedoms, even if guaranteed under the constitution. Such declarations usually come during a time of natural or man made disaster, during periods of civil unrest, or following a declaration of war or situation of international or internal armed conflict.\" So why has an emergency been declared by Mayor Rothschild simply to support the mission of the local air force base? Is there an earlier resolution which states once an emergency has been declared, the city is placed under martial law? If anyone can find information on this, please [let me know](https://www.WantToKnow.info/contactus.php) and I will update the information I've compiled on this at [this link](https://www.WantToKnow.info/insider/13-tucson-emergency-secret-martial-law). I learned about this through a member of the 'In the Know' list who gave me [this link](http://en.paperblog.com/tucson-declares-state-of-emergency-effective-martial-law-456986/) to the online debate magazine paperblog. The article there gives a link to the original resolution which no longer functions, yet a downloaded copy is presented. It appears the original was moved to a new location on the Tucson website, which I've given above. The fact that the link no longer functions and was changed raises more suspicions as to what's going on here. I was able to locate the resolution by going to the [official Tucson city website](http://tucsonaz.gov/) and [following the links](http://cms3.tucsonaz.gov/clerks/mayorcouncil) to the Feb. 20th city council meeting, where I found the topic under note #9. Following the links there, I saw the original proposal. I've now copied the original and posted it on WantToKnow.info at [this link](https://www.WantToKnow.info/documents/130220-tucson-emergency-resolution.PDF), should it disappear or be moved again. For supporting materials on the official Tucson website, [click here](http://www.tucsonaz.gov/sirepub/agdocs.aspx?doctype=agenda&itemid=29051). For the agenda of that council meeting, [click here](http://www.tucsonaz.gov/sirepub/mtgviewer.aspx?meetid=1090&doctype=AGENDA) and look for note #9. I don't know who originally discovered this secret addition. It may be an insider. **This may be a test to see if the public in a major city notices they have been placed under martial law. And it may be that this is happening in a number of cities. I hope someone can set up some kind of monitoring system to catch provisions secretly added like this to legitimate resolutions in other cities or states.** To sign a petition against this, [click here](http://www.petition2congress.com/9527/martial-law-tucson-city-council-gives-complete-authority-over-to/).

A Spiritual Journeyer Explores Questions of Consciousness ** Hey wonderful 'In the Know' friends, 2012 has been another rich year for me filled with challenges and growth. I just finished writing my personal summary for the year, which came to 37 pages this year! My life is never boring. Anyway, I thought some of you might enjoy what I wrote in the first two pages. It's an exploration of the question \"what is consciousness?\" The last two paragraphs are a very brief summary of my year. I wish you all a rich and wonderful new year filled with love, joy, and meaning. With abundant love and warm hugs, Fred **2012 - What is Consciousness?** 2012 has been a rich year of meaningful explorations on many fronts for me. One topic to which I keep returning is the question, \"What is consciousness?\" I am increasingly aware that more than anything, I am my consciousness. My consciousness is what experiences everything that I experience. I am aware that I cannot be anywhere but at center of my own consciousness. Yet what is this consciousness that I am? And more broadly what is this consciousness we all experience? I am always here, at the center of my consciousness, and you are always there at the center of yours. Somehow we meet, we interact, and we affect each other's consciousness. Besides you and others I meet, there is a huge variety of stimuli from the outside world which interact with my consciousness every day. Yet no matter what happens, I always have choice in how I respond to these interactions and in where I focus my attention. Then there is my whole internal world of thoughts, emotions, memories, and beliefs which somehow arise from places inside of me. These can affect or even dominate my consciousness, at times even when I don't want them to. Yet as with the external stimuli, I always have choice in how I respond to these internal impulses. **How I respond to both the internal and external stimuli has a huge impact on my experience of life. Though I have limited control over what happens to me, through conscious choice I can have considerable control over how my consciousness interprets everything that happens.** When I interact with another person, another consciousness, I'm increasingly aware of processes affecting our interactions which arise out of unconscious places inside each of us. There appear to be energetic fields which invisibly emanate out from each of us and interact in ways of which most people have little to no awareness. Yet by choosing to be more aware of these energetic fields and interactions, I'm finding I can increasingly bring these previously unconscious interactions into my conscious awareness and thus have greater choice in how I respond to and interact with others. I'm increasingly coming to see that", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:insider__13-what-is-consciousness.txt:0:72d4461312dc", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 11641, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "insider__13-what-is-consciousness.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "insider__13-what-is-consciousness", "chunk_index": 1, "text": "unconscious places inside each of us.

Yet by choosing to be more aware of these energetic fields and interactions, I'm finding I can increasingly bring these previously unconscious interactions into my conscious awareness and thus have greater choice in how I respond to and interact with others. I'm increasingly coming to see that everything that I perceive happening outside of me seems to be a reflection of what is going on somewhere deep inside me. My perceptions of the external world seem to be formed as a result of my conscious choices, my subconscious beliefs, my unconscious processes or any combination of these. **There seems to be a dance between my inner world and external world over which my consciousness clearly has some influence, yet always there is an element of the unknown, the mystery. ** Exploring consciousness like this on a regular basis has given me a different perspective on life. I have what on one level feels like a detachment that allows me to see a bigger picture, yet on another level the ability to choose fuller engagement with both my internal and my external worlds as they interact with my consciousness. Fascinating! I am so enjoying this exploration ever deeper into both my internal and external landscapes and how they interact with my consciousness. **Diary entry Nov. 9: **Very rich and vivid dreams last night. I even consciously crossed the veil several times and remembered that I was dreaming. It was clear that a group of us were experimenting with consciousness. Explorations into the nature of consciousness and other profound questions of life have been incredibly fascinating for me this year. Through Bikram yoga, times in silence and meditation, breathwork, dreams, and especially a number of powerfully expansive sacred medicine journeys, I have gained a tremendous amount of mystical experience and knowledge. **Yet I'm also finding that the more I know, the more I realize I don't know. In the end I have to conclude that life is a divine mystery. It is a sacred gift which allows each of us, as fragments of the divine, to explore ourselves, each other, our world, and All That Is. ** Though it's been a very rich spiritual journey, there were no big changes or major new directions in my external life this year. I got my first private Indonesian interpreting gig in three years, which I very much enjoyed. PEERS continues to gradually grow and attract interest, and an awesome volunteer from Hungary has helped tremendously with our fund raising. I also explored several new relationships which have each been rich in their own way.

A 1949 FBI memo revealed that the FBI [destroyed thousands of UFO reports](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/apr/11/fbi-destroys-ufo-reports), supposedly due to a lack of filing space.

Within hours, however, the statement was quickly retracted and reclassified as a weather balloon. As a result, the press lost interest and the story was buried for the next thirty years. **Then, in 1978, Major Jesse Marcel, the Air Force intelligence officer tasked with investigating the wreckage, [broke the silence](https://www.wanttoknow.info/ufos/roswell-pratt-story.pdf) by publicly stating that what crashed outside of Roswell in 1947 was not a weather balloon.** Healing Our Bodies The Roswell crash was one of many UFO incidents investigated by [Project Blue Book](https://www.wanttoknow.info/a-project-blue-book-based-a-true-ufo-story).

Monday, the 8th of April, the last day of the Walk, is the eve of the Holocaust day, a day of deep emotion for the Jewish community. The walk goes through Jerusalem to the foot of the old city walls. I had been planning to join the group in the morning, but after a sleepless night I decide to join later. In the early afternoon, I walk up to the walls of the old city to join the walkers. When I get to Jaffa gate, I find myself in front of a very agitated elderly Arab man exchanging insults with an elderly religious Jew who is standing at a bus station a few meters down. They are extremely angry. Some policemen from a Border Police patrol are trying to calm them down, so that it won't turn into a fight. I stand beside the Arab. I speak to him calmly and ask him to sit down without reacting to the other's provocation. I am quite impressed by the restraint shown by the policemen. They don't defend one side or the other and respect both sides.

They don't defend one side or the other and respect both sides. The bus arrives, the Jewish man boards the bus and the situation seems to have settled down. Then, a Jewish woman who was there in the queue from the beginning of the argument takes it upon herself to start insulting the Arab, who reacts immediately. The police have gone and I am left alone to try to calm the situation. I give my attention to the Arab, who would have stayed quiet if he was not continually provoked by the woman. I try from a distance to reason with her without success. She stops a passing police car and says something to the policeman. I explain to him what is going on. I am so happy that all the policemen in this situation act so calmly and help to restore peace. Then, a Palestinian woman on her way to Jaffa gate bursts onto the scene. She jumps to the conclusion that the old Arab is under attack and rushes in a frenzy to rescue him. She yells insults at the Jewish woman, and the situation heats up again. All my attention is now focused on her. She is like a bomb ready to explode. I try to explain to her what is going on, but she is furious with me, screaming out her hatred, her despair and her pain. **This whole situation is greater than the two of us and takes on proportions beyond our present meeting. This is Palestine accusing Israel.** At this moment I represent Israel for her. She shouts out her sorrow about what is going on now in the territories, the military incursions into Palestinian towns. She has family and friends in Jenin and says that our soldiers are war criminals. She is convinced that we want to kill them all. Why do we hate them so much? They are not responsible for the Holocaust, why should they be paying the price? Pointing at the Jewish woman, she assures me that in the Arab country from where this Sephardi woman comes, she was treated with honor, as a human being and yet look at how she behaves with Palestinians now! It goes on and on. She shouts and spews her hatred for Israel at me. I don't try to argue with her at all.

I don't show any reaction to all these accusations. **I feel a huge compassion and an intense need just to listen to her. My patience is nourished by understanding that behind this overwhelming hatred is a deep suffering and pain aggravated by the present situation of war.** It must express itself in some way so that healing can take place. I don't let myself get tempted or trapped into guilt or anger. I am sorry for the tragedy on both sides. I let her express herself for a long time without interrupting her. As she continues to shout at me, I tell her that she has no need to speak so loudly, because I am listening to her with all my attention. At the same time I find myself caressing her arm. She lets me do it and progressively lowers her voice, while continuing to let her despair overflow. She says to me, \"Do you understand why some of us come and commit suicide among you? You kill us anyway, so why not kill you at the same time?\" She even mentions the possibility of coming and blowing herself up out of despair. I tell her softly that I don't want her to die. Nobody should come to this decision. We all suffer on both sides. She goes on and on claiming that the Zionists only want to get rid of the Palestinians. I tell her,** \"You see I am a Zionist, and I don't want to get rid of you. I wish we could live together as good neighbors.\"** She listens to me! She tells me about the demonstration that took place the week before near Ramallah. Then she asks me to donate some money to buy phone cards for Palestinians who need them. I give her some money. At this stage the conversation is quite normal between us. She doesn't shout any more, she is even able to listen to me. She is almost calm when I notice the people of the Walk approaching us slowly, at the top of the street. They are in a line, a hundred of them, one after the other walking in silence, slowly, quietly, aware of each step, creating an atmosphere of peace and safety around them. They are very present. They radiate calm and warmth. I point them out to her and explain that this is the reason I came here, to join a walk of peace in which Palestinians and Israelis walk together.

I tell her about the Walk, its message of coexistence and peace; peace at every step, here and now. I suggest that she come into the line with me. She hesitates and rejects my offer. At this moment they reach us. Several people I know shake my hand warmly as they go by. A young woman approaches her and gives her a kiss. It appears that they know each other. I notice that she is very moved by the Walk and the atmosphere it radiates. She is much calmer now. Nothing like the furious woman I met only several minutes before. The end of the line passes by us and I want to join it. Again I invite her and again she declines. I tell her that I understand and respect her decision. Before I go I tell her, \"I am sure that someday we will succeed in building peace between us.\" She smiles and replies, \"Me too.\" **Then to my total surprise, she comes close to me and kisses me on my cheeks! She walks alongside the line for a while. She tells me that she likes this Walk, that it makes her feel good.** She says it gives her relief and that her mood is much better now. I am very, very moved. I feel overwhelmed by this encounter, especially by its unexpected ending. Peace was there around the corner! I did not miss it!! I never understood so fully as in this moment, the deep meaning of the words pronounced by Thich Nhat Hanh in Shanghai on the 19th of October, after the September 11th tragedy: **\"Terror is in the human heart. We must remove it from the heart. The root of terrorism is misunderstanding, hatred and violence. This root cannot be located by the military. Bombs and missiles cannot reach it, let alone destroy it. Only through the practice of finding calm and looking deeply within can our insight reveal and identify this root. Only with the practice of deep listening and compassion can terror be transformed and removed. Darkness cannot be dissipated with more darkness. Only light can dissipate darkness.

When we become aware of our ego's desires and choose to focus more on what our deeper essence truly wants, everything begins to change. Enjoy this inspiring essay, and have a beautiful day while you're at it! With very best wishes, [Fred Burks](https://www.WantToKnow.info/aboutus#burks) for [PEERS](https://www.peerservice.org) and [WantToKnow.info](https://www.WantToKnow.info) **Love and Commitment: From Ego to Essence From Gina Lake's *[Choosing Love: How to Find True Love and Keep It Alive](http://www.amazon.com/Choosing-Love-Find-True-Alive/dp/0615223788/ref=sr_1_1?s=gateway&ie=UTF8&qid=1285109007&sr=8-1)*** Consider the commitments of your ego and your Essence. The ego doesn't want to commit to anything - a place, a relationship, a career - because it believes that something better may be possible. And it's willing to forgo what's present for the possibility of something better that isn't present. Essence, on the other hand, is committed to whatever is. It doesn't commit into the future because all that exists is the present. This is the essential difference between the ego and Essence: The ego dreams of something better in the midst of whatever is, while Essence simply enjoys and commits attention and love to whatever is. In fact, committing attention to anything that is present results in enjoyment. This is why the ego enjoys so little - it commits attention to what isn't present and to what it doesn't have, and suffers over that, rather than committing attention to whatever is. It loves its fantasies, dreams, and desires more than it loves reality. **To love, we have to fall in love with reality - with what's true right now, not with what might be true in the future or with what we want to be true in the future. Love happens in the now (like everything, really).** That's why the ego doesn't know about love - because love is the experience of being in the now, or the present moment. As soon as the ego experiences the now, it runs from it. Commitment takes a willingness to fall in love with reality - with the real partner who is in front of you - rather than seek something else, either actually or through fantasy. What you commit to is what's here right now. Who knows what will be here next? All you ever really have is what's here right now, so it makes sense to commit to that, in other words, to give your full attention - your love -", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:inspiration__10__commitment_love.txt:0:992f3159e67a", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 11659, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "inspiration__10__commitment_love.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "inspiration__10__commitment_love", "chunk_index": 1, "text": "from it. Commitment takes a willingness to fall in love with reality - with the real partner who is in front of you - rather than seek something else, either actually or through fantasy. What you commit to is what's here right now. Who knows what will be here next? All you ever really have is what's here right now, so it makes sense to commit to that, in other words, to give your full attention - your love - to that. Those who have difficulty committing to a relationship often have difficulty committing to other things as well. They have an underlying belief that what's here isn't good enough, and what's somewhere else is better. This is the ego's basic assumption about life: Whatever is happening now isn't it. It is somewhere else, with it meaning ultimate happiness and contentment. The ego assumes that because it perceives whatever is happening as not good enough, it is, in fact, not good enough. It then concludes that must mean there's something else that will be good enough. The ego imagines that one day it will find peace and happiness because life will finally line up correctly. Those who can't commit are continually waiting for life to line up, to fall into place, and they're quite sure that future vision doesn't look like whatever life looks like now. The funny thing (or not so funny thing) is that life never does line up for anyone, simply because the ego won't perceive it as ever \"lining up.\" It has a habit of perceiving life as imperfect, even when it's quite ideal. In any event, **life isn't meant to be perfect or to fulfill the ego's dreams and desires. It serves a higher purpose, one that has very little to do with the ego's fantasies. Life is essentially about learning to love and learning a lot of other things, too.** And for this reason, life is likely to look less than perfect to the ego. Life brings people into our lives for various reasons. Sometimes we have to be willing to stretch ourselves to gain what can be gained from a relationship or tap the love that is possible. Relationships, like life, aren't meant to be easy, although they can be deeply rewarding. Commitment makes it possible to tap the potential of a relationship. If you give up on a relationship after the first blush is gone, you may never realize this potential. **Sexual union often becomes the glue that keeps people together long enough to begin to experience true love or learn what they need to learn from each other.** Nature has a way of bringing about spiritual lessons and spiritual growth. Sexual attraction is one of the ways Essence brings people together and keeps them together long enough to benefit from each other and grow.

Sexual attraction is one of the ways Essence brings people together and keeps them together long enough to benefit from each other and grow. The ego doesn't appreciate growth, and it's not in relationship for that, or for love really. Its unwillingness to commit and to grow often prevents a relationship that could be a very good one from becoming that. It is forever chasing after the perfect \"10,\" which doesn't exist. But it's difficult to convince the ego of that. It believes in its fantasies. To the ego, it's only a matter of time before \"the one\" shows up. Hope springs eternal. **Essence experiences \"the one\" in [whomever is showing up](https://www.weboflove.org/wingmakers#seeing)**, and that's the difference between Essence and the ego. It's possible to love whoever shows up in your life. In fact, it's very wise to do that if you want to be happy. If you don't want to be happy, just reject whoever shows up in your life. This doesn't mean you shouldn't be discriminating. Loving and saying yes to those who show up in your life doesn't mean getting sexually involved with them unless you want to. Essence says yes to them - is open to them - because it is curious. And then it is very wise about getting more involved with them. Essence commits itself to someone only when love is flowing in both directions and the relationship is rewarding on many levels. The ego, on the other hand, may commit out of sexual attraction or because some other need is met through that relationship, which is not a good basis for commitment. Commitment only makes sense when there is love. **But the ego isn't capable of love. It forms relationships based on needs, and that's when commitment falters.** As soon as someone's needs aren't getting met, then the commitment is questioned. Those who are identified with the ego much of the time have a very difficult time committing, while those who are identified with Essence are able to love and therefore able to commit. Commitment naturally flows from love and appreciation of another. It's the natural outcome of love. And this love is often enough to overcome conditioning and other difficulties that might arise in the relationship. Without love, commitment is hollow; it has no basis. Without love, the foundation for the relationship won't be strong enough to weather conditioning and other difficulties.

Even so, because relationships provide the ego with many of the practical things it values - sex, security, affection, companionship, support, and help - people who are in relationships for egoic reasons often end up discovering love. This is how life draws people out of the ego and into Essence. **Note:** The above essay is take from Gina Lake's book *Choosing Love: How to Find True Love and Keep It Alive*.

The words sank profoundly into my soul - so much so that when I awoke, I found myself moved to share this inspiring poem with others. Many years later, the third stanza came to me while contemplating the interconnectedness of all life.

I have a special invitation for everyone on this list and all others interested in supporting personal and global transformation. I'm sure many of you are now feeling major shifts happening on both personal and global levels. Though we are facing some real challenges, it's an awesome time to be alive, and each of us can play as big of a part as we feel ready to play in spreading love and transformation in our lives and world. **This exciting invitation involves two dates that have sparked the imagination of milions worldwide: 11-11-11 and 12-21-2012. **With all of this concentrated attention, we have a powerful opportunity to focus our energies on these two dates to spread love, healing, and transformation both in our own lives and for all in our world. I have no doubt that when many people focus their energy at the same time on a shared vision, a collective energetic wave is generated which has far-reaching effects. Each extra person who joins in adds exponentially to this wave. Whether or not the actual dates of Nov. 11, 2011 (11-11-11) and Dec. 21, 2012 have inherent value, the fact that so many are paying attention to these dates creates a rich opportunity for all interested to focus our energies together at these points in time. **I invite each of you either to join in one of the events already planned around the world (see [list below](#list)) or to call together a group of friends on these dates to join in inviting ever more love and transformation into our world. ** Here are suggestions for a few key visions upon which we can focus together: Shine light into the darkness See the heart in every person Spread love and transformation to all Invite spiritual guidance in supporting these **Shine light into the darkness:** Behind the scenes on the global stage, much information of key importance has been [hidden from the public](https://www.WantToKnow.info) in order to forward [secret agendas](https://www.WantToKnow.info/mind_control/mind_control_hidden_history) of power and control in our world.

For global leaders who are still focused on old paradigm ways of power and money, and for the parts within each of us which might be overly focused on money and power, let's energetically invite these to open to the richness and power of our hearts to feel love and to value the deeper things in life.** It's not about rebellion, it's about awakening to the infinite potentials within ourselves and all around us for ever deeper love and more meaningful connection!** **Invite spiritual guidance in supporting these: **I have no doubt that there are many guiding spirits, guardian angels, and beings from places beyond our planet and from dimensions more expanded than this three-dimensional world who are more than eager to support us in our desire to spread love and transformation.

The highly decorated veteran had logged thousands of dives as a Special Ops Force Recon Marine in 18 years of service. But, as Reyes recalls, \"As combat divers we operate at night, pushing 200 pounds of equipment, carrying massive weapons. It's very stressful and we focus on the mission - taking on the enemy.\" In the Caribbean, Reyes dove for the first time during daytime at his own pace, guided by his friend Jim Ritterhoff, who worked with the Central Caribbean Marine Institute. **At the time, Reyes was struggling with depression, post-traumatic stress and substance abuse. \"I had a really hard drug habit after all these intense combat tours,\" he admits, but diving in the Caymans, surrounded by vibrant marine life, reignited a sense of wonder**. \"It brought me back to life. It inspired the same kind of protective spirit and willingness to go fight in the battlefield that I used in the Marine Corps, but now I wanted to use that passion to fight for ocean conservation.\" In 2016, Reyes, Ritterhoff and Keith Sahm co-founded [Force Blue](https://forceblueteam.org/veterans/), a nonprofit that recruits veterans - especially Navy SEALs and Special Operations divers with military dive training - to channel their skills into marine conservation. \"We're learning to transfer combat diving expertise into protecting and providing refuge for this incredible aquatic environment,\" Reyes", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:inspiration__25__former-navy-seals-saving-ocean.txt:0:fd96c9fa5885", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 11680, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "inspiration__25__former-navy-seals-saving-ocean.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "inspiration__25__former-navy-seals-saving-ocean", "chunk_index": 1, "text": "willingness to go fight in the battlefield that I used in the Marine Corps, but now I wanted to use that passion to fight for ocean conservation.\" In 2016, Reyes, Ritterhoff and Keith Sahm co-founded [Force Blue](https://forceblueteam.org/veterans/), a nonprofit that recruits veterans - especially Navy SEALs and Special Operations divers with military dive training - to channel their skills into marine conservation. \"We're learning to transfer combat diving expertise into protecting and providing refuge for this incredible aquatic environment,\" Reyes explains. **Note:** Explore more positive [human interest stories](https://wanttoknow.info/top-human-interest-storiesmediaarticles) and stories on [healing the Earth](https://wanttoknow.info/healing-our-earthmediaarticles). **How Rappler Is Building Its Own Communities to Counter AI and Big Tech** **July 25, 2024, Global Investigative Journalism Network** [https://gijn.org/stories/rappler-building-communities-counter-ai-big-tech/](https://gijn.org/stories/rappler-building-communities-counter-ai-big-tech/) Rappler, founded by a group of journalists in 2012, has evolved over time to become one of the leading, most trusted news outlets in the Philippines. In December, the organization launched [Rappler Communities](https://communities.rappler.com/), a trailblazing mobile app which it had built and connected directly to their news feed. **Built on the open source, secure, decentralized [Matrix protocol](https://matrix.org/about/), the app has the potential to become a global independent news distribution outlet, and promises to pave the way for a \"shared reality\"** - a call [founder and Nobel laureate Maria] Ressa has been making to counter \"the cascading failures of a corrupted public information ecosystem.\" \"At this moment, if news journalism doesn't come together with communities and civil society that cares about a shared reality, democracy cannot survive,\" [said Ressa]. \"Most important, is that we really have a shared reality. Once our community is set at the matrix protocol chat app, it can then work with other news organizations and become a trusted news distributor. So we will own our distribution, and we could strengthen our communities. Before the end of the year, we aim to have four other new sites, in different parts of the world, federated on this protocol. The matrix protocol is end-to-end encrypted; it is decentralized, similar to the [Internet Governance Forum](https://www.intgovforum.org/en) - like having a co-op, it isn't individually owned, or profit-driven. It's, literally, a place where we have a shared reality.\" **Note:** Explore more positive stories like this on [people-powered alternative systems](https://www.wanttoknow.info/grassroots-alternative-systemsnewsstories). **An Experiment in Tribally Owned Internet** **February 20, 2024, *The Nation*** [https://www.thenation.com/article/society/hoopa-acorn-wireless-native-internet/](https://www.thenation.com/article/society/hoopa-acorn-wireless-native-internet/) In the final bay of an old, mustard-colored mechanic's garage in the middle of the Hoopa Valley Reservation's main settlement is the headquarters of Acorn Wireless.

Electronic devices, from smartphones to laptops, contain small amounts of gold due to its excellent conductivity and resistance to corrosion. With the rapid turnover of electronic gadgets, e-waste has become the fastest-growing waste stream globally, reaching 62 million tonnes in 2022, and only 22.3 percent of this was formally collected and recycled, leaving vast amounts of valuable materials unused. Professor Raffaele Mezzenga and scientist Mohammad Peydayesh led the ETH Zurich team in developing a method that utilizes \"whey\", the liquid byproduct of cheese-making. By processing whey proteins into amyloid fibrils, they created a sponge-like aerogel capable of selectively absorbing gold ions from acidic solutions derived from e-waste. **Professor Mezzenga stated, \"The fact I love the most is that we're using a food industry byproduct to obtain gold from electronic waste. You can't get much more sustainable than that!\"** In laboratory tests, this aerogel successfully extracted gold from dissolved computer motherboards. The sponge drew out gold that was about 90.8 percent pure, yielding a 22-carat nugget weighing approximately 450 milligrams. The research team is also exploring the use of other food industry byproducts, like pea protein and fish collagen, to diversify the sources of the aerogel. The process is economically viable, with operational costs significantly lower than the market value of the recovered gold, unlike traditional gold extraction techniques that rely on toxic chemicals like cyanide. **Note:** Explore more positive stories", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:inspiration__25__former-navy-seals-saving-ocean.txt:2:267d8849b201", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 11682, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "inspiration__25__former-navy-seals-saving-ocean.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "inspiration__25__former-navy-seals-saving-ocean", "chunk_index": 3, "text": "The sponge drew out gold that was about 90.8 percent pure, yielding a 22-carat nugget weighing approximately 450 milligrams.

Scientists Invent Biodegradable Material That Could Replace Plastics** **March 28, 2025, *The Debrief*** [https://thedebrief.org/transparent-wood-scientists-invent-biodegradable...](https://thedebrief.org/transparent-wood-scientists-invent-biodegradable-material-that-could-replace-plastics/) A team of researchers searching for safe, sustainable, and biodegradable alternatives to plastics presented a new type of transparent material at the American Chemical Society (ACS) [spring meeting](https://www.acs.org/meetings/acs-meetings/spring.html). **Unlike previous transparent \"wood\" designs that sacrifice some biodegradability for strength by including certain types of plastics, the team said its eco-friendly see-through material is made with all natural components**. Potential applications for the plastic alternative include electronic device screens, wearable sensors, coatings on solar cells, and transparent wood windows. Bharat Baruah, a professor of chemistry ... said his woodworking hobby led him to research efforts to create transparent wood. He quickly discovered that successfully created transparent wood materials were enhanced with epoxy, a type of plastic, to increase its strength, sacrificing some biodegradability. The professor decided he should see if there were better alternatives. After enlisting Ridham Raval, a Kenneshaw State undergraduate student, to help, the duo used a vacuum chamber, sodium sulfite, sodium hydroxide, and bleach to remove lignin and hemicellulose, two of wood's three components, from a sample of balsa wood. What remained was a paper-like layer of cellulose filled with tiny pores. Instead of refilling the pores with epoxy, the team soaked the cellulose layer in a mixture of egg whites and rice extract. They were \"left with semi-transparent slices of wood that were durable and flexible.\" **Note:** Explore more positive stories like this on [healing the Earth](https://wanttoknow.info/healing-our-earthmediaarticles) and [technology for good](https://wanttoknow.info/tech-for-goodmediaarticles). **'It shapes the whole experience': what happens when you build a city from wood?** **April 25, 2025, *The Guardian* (One of the UK's Leading Newspapers)** [https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/apr/25/it-shapes-the...](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/apr/25/it-shapes-the-whole-experience-what-happens-when-you-build-a-city-from-wood) It is surprisingly quiet inside the construction site of a high school extension in Sickla, a former industrial area in south Stockholm that is set to become part of the \"largest mass timber project in the world.\" \"It's a fantastic working environment - no concrete dust, no silica dust issues.

While we knew he loved us, he would rarely, if ever, say the words \"I love you.\" But after an aneurysm, a helicopter ride to the hospital, and hours of surgery gave him a new perspective on life, I've noticed a change in him. His chances of survival were slim - at least that's what I assumed it meant when my brother, who's also a doctor, said: \"This doesn't look good.\" **He said: \"I'm sorry. It's really hard to watch people you love when they are in pain.\" These words - from my father who showed little emotion and rarely said \"I love you\" - felt surreal. I wondered how he could be so selfless, worrying about others while he was in great pain**. At that moment, I felt a deep affection for him. In the past, he was quick to state his opinion on any given topic; now I see him listening more, thinking before he shares his perspective. When I talk to him on the phone, his voice is softer, and before we hang up, he says, \"I love you.\" Witnessing my father become more open has reminded me that I still have room to grow.

Jose Hernandez, from Canada, said his journey to the other side began with a brutal accident as an electrical engineer tending to roadside power lines. When his colleague crashed their utility truck on January 6, 2000, the then 46-year-old Hernandez was left with multiple broken ribs preventing him from breathing as emergency medical technicians raced him to intensive care. **Despite his disbelief in the afterlife, Hernandez said that he spent those moments of deep physical pain seeking help from a higher power**. Hernandez said [his consciousness was soon transported](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-13872881/I-died-operating-table-entered-state-life-death-saw-different-Id-taught-Catholic-Church.html) through a dark otherworldly portal that led to a mysterious transitional realm of living light and color. He spent three minutes clinically dead, came back but fell back into the same state for another two minutes, which he said felt like hours as he watched his lifeless body in the hospital. [A] spirit-like figure [offered] him words of comfort as he transitioned to 'the other side.' 'I heard the voice next to me say 'Think of the your body as a car, and that car has like five million miles on it, and there's nothing we can do to fix it anymore. So you have to now say goodbye to your body,'' he remembered. This realm allowed him to reconcile with his deceased father. 'It was even more amazing because me and my father had a very hard relationship,' Hernandez noted. 'We had a lot of clashes and I don't ever remember saying to my father in life, 'I love you,' or he to me.' But all that changed when they met again in this realm. When I met my dad on the other side,' he told the podcast, 'I realized sometimes we may not be able to say something here, [but] we're gonna be able to say it somewhere else.' **Note:** Explore more positive stories like this in our comprehensive [inspiring news articles archive](https://www.wanttoknow.info/inspirationalnewsarticles) focused on solutions and bridging divides. **Some gut microbes can", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:inspiration__25__man-leaves-hate-group.txt:2:b07e78a05eca", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 11688, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "inspiration__25__man-leaves-hate-group.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "inspiration__25__man-leaves-hate-group", "chunk_index": 3, "text": "father in life, 'I love you,' or he to me.'

The findings are welcome news as the only options that exist for reducing the level of dangerous Pfas compounds from the body are bloodletting and a cholesterol drug that induces unpleasant side effects. **The microbes were found to remove up to 75% of some Pfas from the gut of mice. Several of the study's authors plan to develop probiotic dietary supplements that boost levels of helpful microbes in the human gut, which would likely reduce Pfas levels**. \"If this could be used in humans to create probiotics that can help remove Pfas from the body then this would be a nicer solution in that it wouldn't have so many side effects,\" said Anna Lindell, Cambridge doctoral student and a co-author of the study. Pfas are a class of about 15,000 compounds most frequently used to make products water-, stain- and grease-resistant. They have been linked to cancer, birth defects, decreased immunity, high cholesterol, kidney disease and a range of other serious health problems. They are dubbed \"forever chemicals\" because they do not naturally break down in the environment. The microbes [in the study] largely addressed \"long-chain\" Pfas, which are larger compounds and more dangerous than smaller \"short chains\" because they stay in the body longer. **Note:** Explore more positive stories like this in our comprehensive [healing our bodies](https://wanttoknow.info/healing-our-bodiesmediaarticles) and [technology for good](https://wanttoknow.info/tech-for-goodmediaarticles). **\"Fake food is based on the illusion that we can cheat nature.

Walton School of Medicine in Bentonville, Ark. to become its inaugural class. Named after its founder-the world's richest woman and an heir to the Walmart fortune-the school will train students over the next four years in a radically different way from the method most traditional medical schools use. And that's the point. **Instead of drilling young physicians to chase symptom after symptom and perform test after test, Alice Walton wants her school's graduates to keep patients healthy by practicing something that most doctors today don't prioritize: preventive medicine and whole-health principles**, which involve caring for (and not just treating) the entire person and all of the factors-from their mental health to their living conditions and lifestyle choices-that contribute to wellbeing. Visually, the school lives up to its acronym: AWSOM. The building, with soaring glass walls, is located on Walton family property and includes not just a wellness studio and gym, but a rooftop park, healing gardens where students can study, growing gardens for producing healthy foods, and a reflection pond.

But when patients here are called in ... they're welcomed into the [Preventive Food Pantry](https://www.bmc.org/nourishing-our-community/preventive-food-pantry). Over the next few minutes, staff members tailor a grocery cart to each patient's needs. Someone with a renal condition won't get foods high in potassium, like oranges or potatoes. If they're diabetic, they'll get whole-grain pasta and brown rice. And everyone leaves with vegetables, fruit and other fresh ingredients. **The pantry opened in 2001 after doctors raised the alarm that many of their patients reported not having enough food for their families. Setting up on hospital premises, the pantry was an early pioneer in incorporating access to nutritious food directly into the medical system**. The pantry was initially expected to serve 500 people a month. Today, it serves more than 6,200. Addressing hunger isn't just a question of quantity of food, but also quality. Healthy produce, fresh meat and dairy products tend to be more expensive, so for families trying to stretch their dollar, those foods are harder to afford. Faced with high costs of treating conditions linked to food insecurity, medical systems, health insurers and government programs have become more interested in ways to support nutrition access. A [Greater Boston Food Bank] [survey](https://www.gbfb.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/GBFB_Food-Access-Report_2024_final.pdf) found that among people who were screened for food insecurity in a medical setting, 87 percent followed up on recommended resources. **Note:** Explore more positive stories like this in our comprehensive [inspiring news articles archive](https://www.wanttoknow.info/inspirationalnewsarticles) focused on solutions and bridging divides. **Hero Service Dog Senses Owner's Irregular Heartbeat-Saving the Veteran From a Catastrophic Stroke** **August 3, 2025, *Good News Network*** [https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/hero-service-dog-senses-his-owners...](https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/hero-service-dog-senses-his-owners-heartbeat-soaring-into-the-170s-saving-the-military-veteran-from-a-catstrophic-stroke/) The service dog named Tommy had been with Hank Ford since he was a pup, and he knew his owner was at risk.

He decided to check his vital signs with a blood pressure cuff and was startled by the results. His pulse was a staggering 171 beats per minute. The military veteran who had served for more than 20 years, called his local veterans hospital, but they thought his vital readings were obviously wrong. Hank ... drove himself to the hospital, and the diagnosis arrived a few minutes later. \"They were freaking out about it,\" Hank recalled, when doctors confirmed his vital signs. **\"Something about the way he woke me up: He hasn't done it before and he hasn't done it since,\" Hank told GNN. \"Doctors said, more than likely, it would have been a stroke and it would have been a (big) one.\"** When he left the military ... Hank reached out to the [Wounded Warrior Project](https://www.woundedwarriorproject.org/) for a service dog. That organization helped connect him with [Dogs Inc](https://dogsinc.org/), a nonprofit that provides guide dogs, service dogs, and therapy dogs, free of charge, to people in need. Not long afterward, Hank and Tommy were united. Hank received a new best friend and a new path forward. When Hank's heart was on the verge of a potentially-fatal malfunction ... his wife brought the dog in to see him. **Tommy crawled right up onto Hank's bed and laid across his body. The dog stayed there for hours, just inches away from the beating heart of the man he had helped to heal years ago.** It's no surprise that he was the crucial first responder and hero when Hank's heart spun wildly out of rhythm. **Note:** Explore more positive stories like this on [animal wonders](https://wanttoknow.info/animal-wondersmediaarticles). **For more good news: ** Check out our collection of inspiring resources in our [Inspiration Center](https://www.wanttoknow.info/inspirational).

They say living in what is known as a \"[lonelygenic environment](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2542519622003060)\" - one dominated by cars and concrete instead of grass and trees - can cause or aggravate loneliness.

One proposed approach for tackling loneliness as a public health issue is through [social prescribing](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/1757913920967040), where physicians connect their patients with non-medical services in the community similar to how they prescribe medication.

Conducted by researchers at Sweden's Karolinska Institutet, the study addresses a long-standing debate about how adaptable the adult brain really is. The hippocampus plays a critical role in memory, learning, and emotional regulation. [In 2013](https://news.ki.se/new-neurons-generated-in-the-hippocampus-of-adult-humans), Jonas Frisén and his team at Karolinska Institutet made headlines when they demonstrated that new neurons could form in this region during adulthood. Despite this earlier discovery, questions remained. In particular, scientists lacked direct evidence that the cells responsible for generating new neurons, known as neural progenitor cells, are present and actively dividing in adult human brains. **\"We have now been able to identify these cells of origin, which confirms that there is an ongoing formation of neurons in the hippocampus of the adult brain,\" says Jonas Frisén** ... who led the research. The newly formed cells were located in a specific area of the hippocampus. This area is important for memory formation, learning, and cognitive flexibility. \"This gives us an important piece of the puzzle in understanding how the human brain works,\" explains Jonas Frisén. \"Our research may also have implications for the development of regenerative treatments that stimulate neurogenesis in neurodegenerative and psychiatric disorders.\" **Note:** Explore more positive stories like this on [healing our bodies](https://wanttoknow.info/healing-our-bodiesmediaarticles). **After leaving the Navy, I was doing cocaine, popping pills, and drinking over a fifth of vodka a day.

This advertisement - a screengrab from an online marketplace used by ISIS fighters to barter for sex slaves - is one of many Abdullah Shrem keeps in his phone. Each offers vital clues - photographs, locations - that he hopes will help him save Yazidi girls and young women like this girl from the militants holding them captive.

Then Islamic State forces arrived, announcing their terror in symbols daubed on the doorways of the homes they raided: \"They wrote the letter Y on our homes and on our stores and built a barrier like the Berlin Wall - N for the Christians, and Y for the Yazidis. S for the Sunnis, and Sh for the Shi'ites,\" Shrem recalls. The Yazidis met the worst fate: men were marched into mass graves and shot, while women were separated - young from old, mothers from children, wives from virgins. The younger were taken to a \"marketplace\" to be sold as sex slaves or sabaya; the older were killed or sold as domestic slaves. **Shrem's response was extraordinary: he left beekeeping to create a network of rescuers - modelled on the female-led fortress of the beehive - who would return the kidnapped women to their families**. \"I cultivated a hive of transporters and smugglers from both sexes to save our queens,\" he tells Dunya Mikhail, an American-Iraqi journalist, [whose book](https://www.amazon.com/Beekeeper-Sinjar-Weiss-translator-Mikhail/dp/1788161262) is centred on the women Shrem rescues.

This \"Remission for Reading\" program is now serving as a template to other nations, and prison populations are enjoying similar deals in countries such as Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan. With a recidivism rate of more than 80% and the 15th highest imprisonment rate on the planet, the Brazilian criminal justice system was for decades failing its 1984 mandate which states that prisoners must have access to programs that will help prepare them to reenter society. **Remission for Reading works by offering all Brazilian prisoners regardless of literacy skill or mental faculties access to the prison library, which includes books in Braille and audiobooks for those with poor eyesight**. Once a book is checked out, the inmate has 21 to 30 days depending on the page count to finish it, and then 10 days to complete a written book report to demonstrate their knowledge of the text. Assistance is offered to those who speak different languages or who are intellectually impaired. For each report, the prisoner's sentence is commuted by 4 days. An inmate can submit up to 12 reviews per year, which if maxed out equates to 48 days of commuted sentence. According to a study conducted by the Brazilian Institute of Public Opinion and Statistics, Brazilian prisoners read nine times more than the national average of five books per year. **Note:** Explore more positive stories like this on [repairing criminal justice](https://wanttoknow.info/repairing-our-criminal-justice-systemmediaarticles). **The Promise of Blockchain Is a World Without Middlemen** **March 6, 2017, *Harvard Business Review*** [https://hbr.org/2017/03/the-promise-of-blockchain-is-a-world-without-middlemen](https://hbr.org/2017/03/the-promise-of-blockchain-is-a-world-without-middlemen) The blockchain is a revolution that builds on another technical revolution so old that only the more experienced among us remember it: the invention of the database.

IBM's database model stood unchanged until about 10 years ago, when the blockchain came into this conservative space with a radical new proposition: What if your database worked like a network - a network that's shared with everybody in the world, where anyone and anything can connect to it? Blockchain experts call this \"decentralization.\" **Decentralization offers the promise of nearly friction-free cooperation between members of complex networks that can add value to each other by enabling collaboration without central authorities and middle men. In a world without middle men, things get more efficient in unexpected ways**. A 1% transaction fee may not seem like much, but down a 15-step supply chain, it adds up. These kinds of little frictions add just enough drag on the global economy that we're forced to stick with short supply chains and deals done by the container load, because it's simply too inefficient to have more links in the supply chain and to work with smaller transactions. The decentralization that blockchain provides would change that, which could have huge possible impacts for economies in the developing world. Any transformation which helps small businesses compete with giants will have major global effects. **Note:** This article is also [available here](https://web.archive.org/web/20170320204357/https://hbr.org/2017/03/the-promise-of-blockchain-is-a-world-without-middlemen).

All of the profits are captured by the large intermediaries who operate the platforms. **Recently, a new technology has emerged that could change this imbalance. Blockchain facilitates the exchange of value in a secure and decentralized manner, without the need for an intermediary**. With a blockchain, software applications no longer need to be deployed on a centralized server: They can be run on a peer-to-peer network that is not controlled by any single party. These blockchain-based applications can be used to coordinate the activities of a large number of individuals, who can organize themselves without the help of a third party. Blockchain technology is ultimately a means for individuals to coordinate common activities, to interact directly with one another, and to govern themselves in a more secure and decentralized manner.

The emphasis on the negative in artificial intelligence risks overshadowing what could go right - both in the future as this technology continues to develop and right now. AlphaFold, which was developed by the Google-owned AI company DeepMind, is an AI model that predicts the 3D structures of proteins based solely on their amino acid sequences. That's important because scientists need to predict the shape of protein to better understand how it might function and how it might be used in products like drugs. By speeding up a basic part of biomedical research, AlphaFold has already managed to [meaningfully accelerate](https://www.onedaymd.com/2025/02/alphafold-protein-folding-from-drug.html) drug development in everything from Huntington's disease to antibiotic resistance. A timely warning about a natural disaster can mean the difference between life and death. That is why Google Flood Hub is so important. **An open-access, AI-driven river-flood early warning system, [Flood Hub provides](https://sites.research.google/gr/floodforecasting/) seven-day flood forecasts for [700 million people](https://blog.google/technology/ai/expanding-flood-forecasting-coverage-helping-partners/) in 100 countries**. It works by marrying a global hydrology model that can forecast river levels even in basins that lack physical flood gauges with an inundation model that converts those predicted levels into high-resolution flood maps. This allows villagers to see exactly what roads or fields might end up underwater. Flood Hub ... is one of the clearest examples of how AI can be used for good. **Note:** Explore more positive stories like this on [technology for good](https://wanttoknow.info/tech-for-goodmediaarticles). **For more good news: ** Check out our collection of inspiring resources in our [Inspiration Center](https://www.wanttoknow.info/inspirational).

That's the idea behind a new product launched by an Austin, Texas-based startup that sells disposable diapers paired with fungi intended to break down the plastic. **Each of Hiro Technologies' MycoDigestible Diapers comes with a packet of fungi to be added to the dirty diaper before it is thrown in the trash. After a week or two, the fungi are activated by moisture from feces, urine and the environment to begin the process of biodegradation**. An estimated 4 million tons of diapers were disposed of in the United States in 2018, with no significant recycling or composting. Diapers take hundreds of years to naturally break down. That means the very first disposable diaper ever used is still in a landfill somewhere. To tackle this, Hiro Technologies turned to fungi. These organisms - which include mushrooms, molds, yeasts and mildew - derive nutrients from decomposing organic matter. In 2011, Yale University researchers discovered a type of fungus in Ecuador that can feed on polyurethane, a common polymer in plastic products. They figured the fungus, Pestalotiopsis microspora, would be capable of surviving on plastic in environments lacking oxygen, like landfills. Hiro Technologies co-founder Tero Isokauppila, a Finnish entrepreneur who also founded medicinal mushroom company Four Sigmatic, said there are more than 100 species of fungi now known to break down plastics. **Note:** Explore more positive", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:inspiration__25__plastic-eating-fungi-diapers.txt:0:af743a373f71", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 11704, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "inspiration__25__plastic-eating-fungi-diapers.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "inspiration__25__plastic-eating-fungi-diapers", "chunk_index": 1, "text": "decomposing organic matter.

Some EVs use a device called a [supercapacitor](https://www.explainthatstuff.com/how-supercapacitors-work.html), which stores energy through static electricity rather than a chemical reaction, like in conventional batteries. In these batteries, a material called [graphene](https://www.azonano.com/article.aspx?ArticleID=4841) is used. But graphene is expensive. To create ... \"cannabis cars,\" scientists use hemp bark - a waste product created by cannabis plants - and cooked it to make a substance that resembles graphene. Hemp lasts longer than graphene. It also stores more power and is easy to source. Son Nguyen, Bemp Research's founder, told EnergyTech that the company's lithium-sulfur battery can help solve shortages in the EV battery supply chain. \"Sulfur is very abundant. Boron is also relatively abundant, with the biggest boron mine being in California,\" Nguyen said. \"Being an American company, our focus right now is to make batteries for American electric vehicles, and we do not see any supply chain problems. Bemp batteries are less reliant on rare earth metals from around the globe and thus will help U.S. national security.\" **Note:** Read about why architects are [choosing hemp walls](https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2024/nov/10/beautiful-eco-friendly-and-fire-resistant-why-architects-are-choosing-walls-made-of-hemp) for their superior insulation, resistance to mold and moisture, and environmentally friendly, biodegradable design.

The Energy Observer uses a patchwork of different cutting-edge technologies to generate enough energy to power nine homes each day**. During the day, 200 square meters of solar panels charge up the boat's lithium ion batteries. Any extra energy is stored as hydrogen, thanks to a special fuel cell that goes by the name Rex H2 (short for Range Extender H2). The Rex H2 was made by Toyota, using components from Toyota's hydrogen-powered [Mirai](https://www.cnet.com/roadshow/make/toyota/model/mirai/) vehicle line. The fuel cell brings in seawater, removes the salt and then separates the H from the pure H20 with electricity. When the Energy Observer began its journey in 2017, it could only produce hydrogen while stopped. That changed in a big way with the addition of the Oceanwings, 12-meter sails that improved the efficiency of the Energy Observer from 18% to 42%, to the point where it can now produce hydrogen even while sailing. One of the main benefits of hydrogen is its ability to store more more electricity by weight than its lithium ion competition. This benefit is especially useful at sea.

In the early 1990s, I was working as a physicist at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (\"Berkeley Lab\") when I heard about a devastating cholera outbreak in my home country. I started to study waterborne pathogens with the aim to develop a new way to make water drinkable that would be affordable and effective in rural areas of low income countries. In a short few years, and later on with funding support from the Energy Department and the U.S. Agency for International Development, I came up with an invention - the UV Waterworks - that met all my goals. It was inexpensive, efficient, portable and effective. **Roughly the size of a microwave, the device sanitizes water using UV light to kill harmful bacteria, viruses and molds. It can purify approximately four gallons of water per minute and provide a year's worth of potable drinking water for just seven cents per person**. The University of California, which runs the lab, filed the initial patent. I helped found WaterHealth International, which exclusively licensed the UV Waterworks technology from the university in 1996. In the time since, the invention has benefited tens of million people across India and Africa. Roughly 80% of our customers live below the poverty line in their home countries. **Note:** Read about the ecologist who used sunlight, plants, and pond life to [turn toxic sewage into clean drinking water](https://www.wanttoknow.info/a-yoda-scientists-outsider-ecologist-whose-ideas-from-80s-just-might-fix-our-future)-proving that nature can heal what industry has broken.

For much of September and October 2024, underwater vehicles, fitted with cameras, powerful lights, and sensors, have been hunting for World War II-era explosives purposefully sunk in this region of the Baltic Sea. **Tons upon tons of German munitions were hastily dumped at sea under orders from the Allied powers at the end of World War II, who sought to dispose of the Nazis' arsenal. The clearance work last year was part of a first-of-its-kind project to explore ways to clear up this toxic legacy of war**. \"Conventional munitions are carcinogenic, and the chemical munitions are mutagenic, and also they disrupt enzymes and whatnot-so they are definitely affecting organisms,\" says Jacek Bełdowski, a leading expert on underwater munitions dumps. The next stage of the pilot project, also now underway, is building a floating munitions-disposal facility that could incinerate the aging explosives near the dump sites. That would eliminate the need to bring the ordnance above water ... and ship it overland. Longer term, the dream is to have unmanned underwater vehicles map, scan, and magnetically image the seabed to get a sense of what lies where. **Note:** Explore more positive stories like this on [healing the war machine](https://wanttoknow.info/healing-the-war-machinemediaarticles) and [technology for good](https://wanttoknow.info/tech-for-goodmediaarticles). **Imagine a furnace that heats the whole neighbourhood, not just your home** **February 14, 2024, CBC News (Canada's Public Broadcasting System)** [https://www.cbc.ca/news/science/district-heating-explainer-1.7113827](https://www.cbc.ca/news/science/district-heating-explainer-1.7113827) What if your heating and cooling worked during power outages, and you could count on it becoming more efficient and climate-friendly over time? That's the promise of district heating and cooling or district energy, where entire communities share a heating and cooling system. That allows them to tap into many low-carbon energy sources they couldn't before, more efficiently than any individual building could. As governments look to tackle carbon emissions from buildings - the third largest source in Canada behind the oil and gas industry and transportation - it's an idea that more of them are considering and implementing. Peter Ronson is chief operating officer for Markham District Energy (MDE), a network in a Toronto suburb that heats and cools 14 million square feet in more than 200 buildings, including condo buildings up to 44 storeys tall, a hospital, data centres, hotels and two schools. Some, like the data centres, produce a lot of heat, while others may use lots of hot water. **\"We got all sorts of stuff on the system,\" Ronson said. \"When [some are] throwing away energy, I can recover and give it", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:inspiration__25__plastic-eating-fungi-diapers.txt:4:89e18f925d3a", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 11708, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "inspiration__25__plastic-eating-fungi-diapers.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "inspiration__25__plastic-eating-fungi-diapers", "chunk_index": 5, "text": "Markham District Energy (MDE), a network in a Toronto suburb that heats and cools 14 million square feet in more than 200 buildings, including condo buildings up to 44 storeys tall, a hospital, data centres, hotels and two schools.

Excess heat in the system can also be stored (underground in water or rock, for example) ... and much more cheaply than electricity. All that means converting buildings that burn fossil fuels to district energy can potentially put less strain on the grid than electrifying individual buildings using heat pumps or baseboard heating. **Note:** Explore more positive stories like this on [healing the Earth](https://wanttoknow.info/healing-our-earthmediaarticles) and [technology for good](https://wanttoknow.info/tech-for-goodmediaarticles). **'Dead' Electric Car Batteries Find a Second Life Powering Cities** **March 13, 2023, *Reasons to be Cheerful*** [https://reasonstobecheerful.world/electric-vehicle-batteries...](https://reasonstobecheerful.world/electric-vehicle-batteries-reused-power-stations/) Last month, a small warehouse in the English city of Nottingham received the crucial final components for a project that leverages the power of used EV batteries to create a new kind of circular economy. Inside, city authorities have installed 40 two-way electric vehicle chargers that are connected to solar panels and a pioneering battery energy storage system, which will together power a number of on-site facilities and a fleet of 200 municipal vehicles. Each day Nottingham will send a combination of solar-generated energy - and whatever is left in the vehicles after the day's use - from its storage devices into the national grid. What makes the project truly circular is the battery technology itself. Funded by the European Union's [Interreg North-West Europe Programme](https://www.nweurope.eu/), the energy storage system, [E-STOR](https://connected-energy.co.uk/battery-energy-storage/), is made out of used EV batteries by the British company Connected Energy. After around a decade, an EV battery no longer provides sufficient performance for car journeys. However, they still can retain up to 80 percent of their original capacity, and with this great remaining power comes great reusability. **\"As the batteries degrade, they lose their usefulness for vehicles,\" says Matthew Lumsden, chairman of Connected Energy. \"But batteries can be used for so many other things, and to not do so results in waste and more mining of natural resources.\"** One study ... calculated that a second life battery system saved 450 tons of CO2 per MWh over its lifetime. **Note:** Explore more positive stories like this in our comprehensive [inspiring news articles archive](https://www.wanttoknow.info/inspirationalnewsarticles) focused on solutions and bridging divides. **For more good news: ** Check out our collection of inspiring resources in our [Inspiration Center](https://www.wanttoknow.info/inspirational).

It all started as the old train car was clanking and rattling over the rails. It was comparatively empty - a few housewives with their kids in tow, some old folks out shopping, a couple off-duty bartenders casually glancing through the sports section of the local newspaper. I was gazing absently at the drab houses and dusty hedgerows. **Then as the doors opened at one unremarkable station, the calm afternoon was suddenly shattered. A man on the platform bellowed at the top of his lungs, yelling violent, obscene, incomprehensible curses. Just before the doors closed, the still yelling man staggered into our car. ** He was big, drunk and dirty. He wore laborer's clothing. His ragged shirt was stiff with dried vomit, his hair crusted with filth. His bloodshot eyes were bugged out, beaming scorn and hatred to all who caught his glance. Screaming obscenities, he swung his big fist wildly at the first person he could reach, a scared young woman holding a baby. **The blow glanced off her shoulder, sending her spinning into the laps of an elderly couple. It was a miracle that she was not badly hurt and the baby was unharmed.** As the frightened young woman ducked for cover, protecting her baby, the elderly couple jumped up and scrambled toward the other end of the car. They were terrified. The big laborer aimed a wobbling kick at the retreating back of the old lady. \"You old whore!\" he bellowed, 'I'll kick your ass!\" He missed, as the old woman barely scuttled to safety. This so enraged the wretched drunk that he grabbed the metal pole in the center of the car and tried to wrench it out of its stanchion. I could see that one of his hands was cut and bleeding, likely from an earlier scuffle.

I could see that one of his hands was cut and bleeding, likely from an earlier scuffle. The train lurched ahead, the scattered passengers frozen with fear. I stood up. I was young then, and in pretty good shape. I stood six feet, weighed 225 and spoke fluent Japanese. I'd been putting in a solid eight hours of Aikido training every day for the past three years. I liked to throw and grapple. I thought I was tough. Trouble was my martial arts skill was untested in actual combat. As students of Aikido, we were not allowed to fight. **My teacher, the founder of Aikido, taught us each morning that the art was devoted to peace. \"Aikido,\" he said again and again, \"is the art of reconciliation. Whoever has the mind to fight has broken his connection with the universe. If you try to dominate other people, you are already defeated. In Aikido, we study how to resolve conflict, not how to start it.\"** I had listened to his words. I tried hard. I wanted to quit fighting. I had even gone so far as to cross the street a few times to avoid the the pinball punks who lounged around the train stations. They'd have been happy to test my martial arts ability. My forbearance exalted me. I felt both tough and holy. Yet in my heart of hearts, I was still dying to be a hero. A part of me still wanted a chance - an absolutely legitimate and justified opportunity - to save the innocent by destroying the guilty. 'This is it!' I thought to myself, as I stood up tall and proud to confront this menace to society. 'This slob, this cruel animal, is drunk and mean and violent. People are in immediate danger. If I don't do something fast, somebody is going to get hurt. It's time to take his ass to the cleaners.' Seeing me stand up, the belligerent drunk relished the chance to focus his rage. \"Aha!\" he roared, \"A foreigner! You need a lesson in Japanese manners!\" He landed a heavy punch on the metal pole beside him to give weight to his words.

I was stunned by the strangely joyous, lilting quality of it - as though you and a friend had been searching all over for something important that was lost, and he had suddenly stumbled upon it and loudly shouted to you, \"Hey!\" I wheeled to my left; the drunk spun to his right. We both found ourselves staring down at a little old man. He must have been well into his seventies, this tiny gentleman, sitting there immaculate in his kimono. He took no notice of me, but beamed delightedly at the laborer, as though he had a most important, most welcome secret to share. \"C'mere,\" the old man said in an easy Japanese vernacular, beckoning to the drunk. \"C'mere and talk with me.\" He waved his hand lightly towards the seat next to him. The big man followed, almost as if on a string.

Women are physiologically better suited than men to endurance efforts such as running marathons. This advantage bears on questions about hunting because a prominent hypothesis contends that early humans are thought to have pursued prey on foot over long distances until the animals were exhausted. Furthermore, the fossil and archaeological records, as well as ethnographic studies of modern-day hunter-gatherers, indicate that women have a long history of hunting game. Females are ... dominating ultraendurance events such as the more than 260-mile Montane Spine foot race through England and Scotland, the 21-mile swim across the English Channel and the 4,300-mile Trans Am cycling race. **In 2018 English runner Sophie Power ran the 105-mile Ultra-Trail du Mont-Blanc race in the Alps while still breastfeeding her three-month-old at rest stations. Observations of recent and contemporary foraging societies provide direct evidence of women participating in hunting**. The most cited examples come from the Agta people of the Philippines. Agta women hunt while menstruating, pregnant and breastfeeding, and they have the same hunting success as Agta men. They are hardly alone. A [recent study](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0287101) of ethnographic data spanning the past 100 years ... found that women from a wide range of cultures hunt animals for food. **Note:** Explore more positive stories like this in our comprehensive [inspiring news articles archive](https://www.wanttoknow.info/inspirationalnewsarticles) focused on solutions and", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:inspiration__amazing-human-stories.txt:2:679d249f772e", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 11720, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "inspiration__amazing-human-stories.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "inspiration__amazing-human-stories", "chunk_index": 3, "text": "participating in hunting**.

The Increasing Signs that Human Consciousness Remains After Death** **February 10, 2018, *Times*** [http://www.newsweek.com/where-do-you-go-when-you-die...](http://www.newsweek.com/where-do-you-go-when-you-die-increasing-signs-human-consciousness-after-death-800443) Clinically, we understand death to mean the state that takes hold after our hearts stop beating. Philosophically, though, our definition of death hinges on something else: the point past which were no longer able to return. Those two were more or less the same until about 50 years ago, when we saw the advent of CPR. Modern resuscitation ... blew apart our understanding of what it means to be dead. Without many people returning from the dead to show us otherwise, it was natural to assume, from a scientific perspective, that our consciousness dies at the same time as our bodies. Over the last few years, though, scientists have seen repeated evidence that once you die, your brain cells take days, potentially longer, to reach the point past which theyve degraded too far to ever be viable again. People who survive medical death [frequently report experiences](http://www.resuscitationjournal.com/article/S0300-9572%2814%2900739-4/fulltext) that share similar themes: bright lights; benevolent guiding figures; relief from physical pain and a deeply felt sensation of peace. Because those experiences are subjective, it's possible to chalk them up to hallucinations. Where that explanation fails, though, is among the patients who have died on an operating table or crash cart and reported watching ... as doctors tried to save them, accounts subsequently verified by the (very perplexed) doctors themselves. **How these patients were able to describe objective events that took place while they were dead, we're not exactly sure. But it does seem to suggest that when our brains and bodies die, our consciousness may not**. **Note:** For more along these lines, see concise summaries of deeply revealing news articles on [near-death experiences](https://www.wanttoknow.info/neardeathexperiencesnewsarticles).

Employing MTEs for routine breast cancer screening - and reaching women in their communities and workplaces - could help in the early detection of cancer and save lives, says Dr. Poovamma CU, the breast specialist under whom Banu and Noorunnisa work. [Studies prove](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0173064) that in the absence of sight, blind people's brains can develop a heightened sense of touch, as well as hearing.

The 38-year-old geobiologist said he believed that magnetite crystals enabled animals from bees to whales to navigate by using the earth's magnetic field. He said he doubted that they supported any sensory capability in humans, although he suspected that they might account for the possible influence of strong electromagnetic fields on human health. **That magnetite, one of the hardest metals on earth, is synthesized by the human brain \"is sure to astound most scientists,\" Dr. Kirschvink said, but what it is doing there is a \"total mystery.\" It might be a vestige from evolution and serve no purpose, he said.

The girl, from the southern town of Knin, had only just started studying German at school and had been reading German books and watching German TV to become better, but was by no means fluent, according to her parents. Since waking up from her 24-hour coma however, she has been unable to speak Croatian, but is able to communicate perfectly in German. Doctors at Split's KB Hospital claim that the case is so unusual, various experts have examined the girl as they try to find out what triggered the change.

He liked to draw pictures of his home too a long single-storey, white house standing in a bay. But it sent shivers down his mums spine because Cameron said it was somewhere they had never been, 160 miles away from where they lived. And he said the mother he was talking about was his old mum. Convinced he had lived a previous life Cameron worried his former family would be missing him. [He] said they were on the Isle Of Barra. Mum Norma, 42, said: Ever since Cameron could speak hes come up with tales of a childhood on Barra. He spoke about his former parents, how his dad died, and his brothers and sisters. Eventually we just had to take him there to see what we could find. It was an astonishing experience. Cameron wouldn't stop begging me to take him to Barra.

[https://www.wanttoknow.info/](https://www.wanttoknow.info/) Jane Goodall is best known for her groundbreaking work with chimpanzees and her lifelong advocacy for animals and the environment. **Yet beneath her scientific and humanitarian legacy lies something even deeper. In this piece, we explore two powerful invitations for humanity that Jane Goodall beautifully exemplified with her life's work.** to be transformed by the mystical experience of awe and wonder to engage across differences without enemy-making Both speak to an evolution in consciousness beyond the illusion of separation. This separation lives not only in systems of power and wealth that exploit the world, but in the polarization and fear that shut down viewpoint diversity and turn us against one another. Goodall embodied this shift through an activism that went beyond the reactivity and division defining modern activism, revealing that the deepest transformation begins with how we relate to one another and to life itself. This way of relating returns us to the deeper nature of reality we live in: the interdependent world that makes our very existence possible. **Transformed By The Mystical Experience of Awe and Wonder** In her memoir [*Reason for Hope: A Spiritual Journey*](https://shop.janegoodall.org/product/Reason-For-Hope-A-Spiritual-Journey/JGI103), Goodall writes about a life-changing experience in 1974 sitting in the Notre Dame cathedral of Paris and hearing an organ playing [Johann Sebastian Bach's Toccata and Fugue in D Minor](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHNLdHe8uxY). For a moment, her mind gave way to something vast and overwhelmingly beautiful. She later described it as the closest she'd come to ecstasy, a word that comes from the Greek *ekstasis*: \"to be or stand outside oneself.\" Years later, she would encounter that same profound experience in the forests of Gombe, Tanzania. * \"Lost in awe at the beauty around me, I must have slipped into a state of heightened awareness. It is hard - impossible really - to put into words the moment of truth that suddenly came upon me then. Even the mystics are unable to describe their brief flashes of spiritual ecstasy. It seemed to me, as I struggled afterward to recall the experience, the self was utterly absent: I and the chimpanzees, the earth and trees and air, seemed to merge, to become one with the spirit power of life itself. The air was filled with a feathered symphony, the evensong of birds. I heard new frequencies in their music and also in singing insects' voices - notes so high and sweet I was amazed. Never had I been so intensely aware of the shape, the color of the individual leaves, the varied patterns of the veins that made each one unique. That afternoon, it had been as though an unseen hand had drawn back a curtain and, for the briefest moment, I had seen through such a window.

That afternoon, it had been as though an unseen hand had drawn back a curtain and, for the briefest moment, I had seen through such a window. In a flash of \"outsight\" I had known timelessness and quiet ecstasy, sensed a truth of which mainstream science is merely a small fraction. **And I knew that the revelation would be with me for the rest of my life, imperfectly remembered yet always within. A source of strength on which I could draw when life seemed harsh or cruel or desperate.\"** * When we experience awe, the boundaries between \"me\" and \"other\" begin to dissolve. Psychologists at UC Berkeley's Greater Good Science Center call this the \"[small self effect](https://www.templeton.org/discoveries/the-science-of-awe),\" when our sense of self-importance surrenders to a self-transcendent state that can measurably change how we think, feel, and act. Psychologists Dacher Keltner and Jonathan Haidt [identified](https://www.templeton.org/discoveries/the-science-of-awe) **the phenomena of awe as encountering something so immense (physically or conceptually) that it exceeds our usual frame of reference: a profound experience in nature, a piece of music, stories of healing and transformation emerging in the most unlikely places, an idea or experience that changes what we believe is possible.** Keltner and Haidt suggest that humans evolved to experience awe because it helps us take in new information and reshape how we understand the world. This mental flexibility not only allows us to adapt, learn, and survive, but it also opens us to higher human values: goodness, beauty, creativity, generosity, and gratitude. *\"Awe is a lightning bolt that marks in memory those moments when the doors of perception are cleansed and we see with startling clarity what is truly important in life.\"* - Psychologist David Elkins Awe isn't about being amazed or starry-eyed. When we bring curiosity and wonder into our activism and relationships as Goodall role-modeled for us, **we are reminded that there's more to life than our fears-especially when these fears are manipulated and exploited by a media machine driven by divisive propaganda that serves entrenched power.** How trustworthy is our certainty when it so often breeds the defensiveness and polarizing dialogue that leaves no room for nuance? Emerging research into near-death experiences, consciousness, quantum science, and reported UFOs defying conventional understanding of physics suggest that the nature of reality is far more complex and mysterious than our existing frameworks can explain. **It might seem like a leap to connect this to today's political turmoil dominating our screens. Yet our collective stories about today's political conflicts-simplistic media narratives, partisan culture wars, identity politics-reveal just how narrow our frames have become.** \"Trust the science,\" \"The far-right is a threat to democracy,\" \"The radical left is destroying our country,\" \"Follow", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:inspiration__are-we-ready-consciousness-shift-jane-goodall.txt:1:a5714f2432be", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 11728, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "inspiration__are-we-ready-consciousness-shift-jane-goodall.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "inspiration__are-we-ready-consciousness-shift-jane-goodall", "chunk_index": 2, "text": "UFOs defying conventional understanding of physics suggest that the nature of reality is far more complex and mysterious than our existing frameworks can explain. **It might seem like a leap to connect this to today's political turmoil dominating our screens.

These simplified stories may be easy to digest, yet how much do we really understand about the hidden systems of corporate and political power that shape our world? **When we allow ourselves to be moved by wonder and curiosity in a world addicted to certainty and outrage, we begin shifting out of defensiveness and into a grounded openness. This openness has a ripple effect.** It changes how we listen, how we speak, and how others feel in our presence. When we bring this state into our relationships or our activism, we become what psychologists call a \"regulating presence,\" the kind of person whose grounded energy helps others relax, think in new ways, open to goodness, and imagine new possibilities. **The Courage to Meet Difference Without Needing an Enemy** **Jane Goodall's work didn't follow the easy path of righteous opposition that defines much of activism today.** It instead unfolded by a more humbling, slower, and deeply human work of relationship. Building relationships with people and companies on the other side was an approach that opened doors activism alone could not. She befriended James Baker, a devout hunter and former US Secretary of State, who used his diplomatic reach to open doors for her across Africa. She worked with [Conoco](https://www.conocophillips.com/spiritnow/story/a-promise-is-a-promise-lessons-from-a-legacy-partnership-in-the-congo), an oil company, to build a chimpanzee sanctuary that rescued hundreds of starving and orphaned chimpanzees. It was Goodall that influenced the National Institutes of Health to end the use of chimpanzees in medical research. * \"I lost a lot of friends because of going into the labs, sitting down and talking to the people, organizing a conference to bring in the lab people, the scientists and also the animal welfare people. There were a lot of animal rights people who refused to speak to me - they said, **'Wow, how can you sit down with these evil people and have a cup of tea with them?'** I was totally and completely flabbergasted.\" **\"If you don't talk to people, how can you expect them to change?\"** said Goodall.

Yet I believe that human unity and common ground are the only real paths to freedom. What transforms a violent world isn't just more negative news and the same old talking points. It's the relationships that break the cycle of hate, fear, and dehumanization. Thank you, Jane Goodall, for bringing so much humanity into the world of activism.

The unmistakable and intense signs that we're in the middle of a massive societal transformation? In times like these, we need *more viewpoint diversity,* not less. No single perspective holds all the answers to the complex, interconnected crises we face as a human species. We need each other's questions, insights, and lived experiences to build a fuller picture of reality. Yet political, racial, gender, and ideological identities-once expressions of liberation and diversity-are now increasingly used to control, divide, and shut down the very conversations that could move us forward. The constant flood of fear, outrage, and urgency in news and social media pump our bodies with adrenaline and dopamine-the same chemicals that drive addiction. Over time, we don't just get hooked on the information itself, but on the feeling it gives us: the certainty, the righteousness, the *identity it reinforces*. This is literally making us sick. It's draining our precious energy, hijacking our nervous systems, spiking our blood pressure, weakening our immunity, and eroding our sense of safety and trust in life. In a time when so much is happening in our heads and on our screens, I recently came across a question that stopped me in my tracks: **Where does the body live in creative change?** **My shuffle dance session in the streets of Minneapolis today felt like a much-needed release-an untangling of everything I've been carrying lately. When I got home, a poem poured out of me. It speaks to something I think we're losing in this moment: our ability to truly see and hear ourselves and one another.** ** [Watch my 3-min dance and poem video here!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06LSe5ffDb8)** (text for poem is below) As political activist and embodiment facilitator Prentis Hemphill once put it, **\"What good is freedom if we don't feel it?\"** For me, dancing is a reminder that freedom isn't just a material or symbolic destination for a healthy society. It's an inner feeling, a state of being, a somatic embodiment of what we want to create in this world that inspires us and brings out the best in us. If and when systems collapse, [what will*we*choose to build together?](https://peerservice.substack.com/p/lonely-world-failing-systems-inspiring) **Be a Voice, Not an Echo** By PEERS Director Amber Yang Fear, emotionally-charged headlines, divisive algorithms.

Your soul, your consciousness, your choices Your capacity to hold different truths To question what you've been told I believe that's where the real power lives. True sovereignty is resilient. It's rooted inside of us- Not in who holds power, Not in who we fear, And not in the echo chamber Of those who look, think, or vote like us. Be a voice, not an echo. Open your mind, body, and heart.

That sounds like an extravagant claim, but it is borne out by evidence. Never has there been less hunger, less disease or more prosperity. **The West remains in the economic doldrums, but most developing countries are charging ahead, and people are being lifted out of poverty at the fastest rate ever recorded. The death toll inflicted by war and natural disasters is also mercifully low. We are living in a golden age.** To listen to politicians is to be given the opposite impression - of a dangerous, cruel world where things are bad and getting worse. This, in a way, is the politicians' job: to highlight problems and to try their best to offer solutions. But **the great advances of mankind come about not from statesmen, but from ordinary people.** Governments across the world appear stuck in what has been described as an [era of 'turboparalysis'](http://www.spectator.co.uk/features/8789631/the-age-of-turboparalysis/) - all motion, no progress. But outside government, progress has been nothing short of spectacular. Take global poverty. **In 1990, the UN [announced](http://www.un.org/millenniumgoals/poverty.shtml) Millennium Development Goals, the first of which was to halve the number of people in extreme poverty by 2015. It [emerged this year](http://siteresources.worldbank.org/INTPOVCALNET/Resources/Global_Poverty_Update_2012_02-29-12.pdf) that the target was met in 2008. **Yet the achievement did not merit an official announcement, presumably because it was not achieved by any government", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:inspiration__best_year.txt:0:6cadaccc01c1", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 11738, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "inspiration__best_year.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "inspiration__best_year", "chunk_index": 1, "text": "what has been described as an [era of 'turboparalysis'](http://www.spectator.co.uk/features/8789631/the-age-of-turboparalysis/) - all motion, no progress.

Buying cheap plastic toys made in China really is helping to make poverty history. And global inequality? This, too, is [lower now](http://cid.bcrp.gob.pe/biblio/Papers/NBER/2009/Octubre/w15433.pdf) than any point in modern times. Globalisation means the world's not just getting richer, but fairer too. *[Note: Though income inequality has dramatically increased in the U.S. and a few other developed countries, major advances in developing countries have actually decreased the overall disparity between the developed and the developing countries in a big way.]* The doom-mongers will tell you that we cannot sustain worldwide economic growth without ruining our environment. But **while the rich world's economies grew by 6 per cent over the last seven years, fossil fuel consumption in those countries [fell](http://www.bp.com/sectionbodycopy.do?categoryId=7500&contentId=7068481) by 4 per cent.** This remarkable (and, again, unreported) achievement has nothing to do with green taxes or wind farms. It is down to consumer demand for more efficient cars and factories. And what about the concerns that the oil would run out? Ministers have spent years thinking of improbable new power sources. As it turns out, engineers in America have found new ways of mining fossil fuel. The amazing breakthroughs in 'fracking' technology mean that, in spite of the world's escalating population - from one billion to seven billion over the last two centuries - we live in an age of energy [abundance](http://www.spectator.co.uk/the-week/7637888/economies-of-shale/). *[Note: Though WantToKnow.info does not support the environmentally destructive practice of fracking, our readers know there are many other clean and very cheap [new energy technologies](https://www.WantToKnow.info/newenergyinventionsnewsarticles), some of which are very close to completely transforming the world of energy. And even if those don't come through, solar energy is [near parity](https://www.WantToKnow.info/a-solar-panel-drops-1-per-watt-this-milestone-or-bottom-siliconbased-panels) with oil and needs only to be scaled up.]* Advances in medicine and technology mean that people across the world are living longer. **The average life expectancy in Africa reached 55 this year. Ten years ago, it was 50.

As developing countries become richer, we can expect the death toll from natural disasters to diminish - and the same UN extrapolations that predict such threatening sea-level rises for Bangladesh also say that, in two or three generations' time, it will be as rich as Britain. War has historically been humanity's biggest killer. But in most of the world today, a generation is growing up that knows little of it. **The Peace Research Institute in Oslo says there have been fewer war deaths in the last decade than any time in the last century.** Whether we are living through an anomalous period of peace, or whether the risk of nuclear apocalypse has proved an effective deterrent, mankind seems no longer to be its own worst enemy. We must bear in mind that things can fall apart, and quickly. Germany was perhaps the most civilised nation in the world in the 1920s. For now, though, it is worth remembering that, in relative terms, we have peace in our time. *[Note: Violent crime rates around the world have also dropped dramatically in recent decades.

In both senses, we are committed to challenging media establishment narratives that divide us instead of bringing us together for the common good. This is especially relevant and needed in a time where the current culture wars have increased hate, propaganda, vindictive political correctness, and centralized power from *all *sides of the political aisle. A [fascinating investigation](https://theintercept.com/2022/06/13/progressive-organizing-infighting-callout-culture/) into the state of progressive advocacy groups around the country reveal how these culture wars are creating massive conflicts, bringing these critical organizations at an unprecedented standstill.

We can't heal or make sense of our challenging times alone. Others may have views that open up different insights. The [Asch psychology experiments on conformity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asch_conformity_experiments) reveal how strongly a person's opinions are affected by people around them, even when it means denying their own intuition and sense of things.

It's not our differences that divide us, it's the judgment about our differences that do. **Healing the polarization in our own lives and larger society is necessary for our collective future, especially a future that is free from harmful and oppressive systems. **With our political systems increasingly feeling like a battleground, theatrical show or a confusing game of charades, who do we turn to for inspiration? Fred Rogers, a prominent moral voice, once said that in times of \"scary news\" of tragedy and disaster,** his mother taught him to not focus solely on destruction or violence. Instead, look for the helpers, who are everywhere. **These are the thought leaders and role models healing the polarization in society and breaking down the walls of groupthink and conformity. In doing so, we begin to re-center the ethic of love in our lives and activism. *If we carry intergenerational trauma, then we also carry intergenerational wisdom. It's in our genes and our DNA.* ― Kazu Haga, nonviolence and restorative justice activist [https://www.WantToKnow.info/inspiration/beyond-cultural-political-wars-ethic-of-love-for-activism](https://www.WantToKnow.info/inspiration/beyond-cultural-political-wars-ethic-of-love-for-activism) Centering an Ethic of Love In Our Lives and Activism There are many reasons for grief, confusion, and rage right now. Martin Luther King Jr. wrote about these related concerns in his final book: *Where Do We Go From Here? Chaos Or Community*. He asserted that humankind has the resources and technology to overcome oppression and corruption. **With many awakening to mass deceptions and corruptions, our times call for some restoration of community, and our sense of common good and connection with each other. Paradoxically, this also means to pay attention to established interests that gain by confusing and dividing us. **To some degree, this means noting what power elites are pushing for, and to correct efforts that serve private gain over the common good (people and environment). *Along the way of life, someone must have sense enough and morality enough to cut off the chain of hate. This can only be done by projecting the ethic of love to the center of our lives.* - Martin Luther King Jr. King often spoke of his vision for a Beloved Community, in which people centered the Greek social concept *agape* in their lives.

Instead of it meaning something sentimental or affectionate, agape is the understanding, creative, redeeming goodwill for *all* people. He shares eloquently: \"If I respond to hate with a reciprocal hate, I do nothing but intensify the cleavage in broken community. I can only close the gap in broken community by meeting hate with love ... **Agape is a willingness to go to any length to restore community.**\" This isn't just a feel-good, rose-colored glasses approach to seeing the world. In fact, the [longest study on human happiness](https://greatergood.berkeley.edu/article/item/what_the_longest_happiness_study_reveals_about_finding_fulfillment) reveals that the top factor to a long and healthy life isn't career achievement, exercise, or a healthy diet. **The one factor that continually demonstrated an enduring importance is having meaningful, quality relationships with loved ones and in the larger community. ** Social commentator and poet bell hooks wrote a powerful essay, \"[*Love is the Practice of Freedom*](https://uucsj.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/bell-hooks-Love-as-the-Practice-of-Freedom.pdf),\" which further explores the need for love in any social movement. She argues that approaches to activism are rooted in overemphasizing material goals like policy change, lawsuits, and learning political jargon. Yet very little attention has been put on changing how we think and relate to each other and our environment. Instead, it is more common to see the shutting down of different perspectives and people treating others as mere disposable artifacts in the cultural economy. *In this society, there is no powerful discourse on love emerging either from politically progressive radicals or from the Left. The absence of a sustained focus on love in progressive circles arises from a collective failure to acknowledge the needs of the spirit and an overdetermined emphasis on material concerns. Without love, our efforts to liberate ourselves and our world community from oppression and exploitation are doomed. * ***Without an ethic of love shaping the direction of our political vision and our radical aspirations, we are often seduced, in one way or the other, into continued allegiance to systems of domination**. It has always puzzled me that women and men who spend a lifetime working to resist one form of domination can be systematically supporting another.... **(with) many of us motivated to move against domination solely when we feel our self-interest directly threatened.

The **civil rights movement transformed society in the United States because it was fundamentally rooted in a love ethic. No leader has emphasized this ethic more than Martin Luther King, Jr. King believed that love is \"ultimately the only answer\" to the problems facing this nation and the entire planet. I share that belief that it is in choosing love... as the ethical foundation for politics, that we are best positioned to transform society. * *Dominator culture has tried to keep us all afraid, to make us choose safety instead of risk, sameness instead of diversity. Moving through that fear, finding out what connects us, reveling in our differences; this is the process that brings us closer, that gives us a world of shared values, of meaningful community.* For hooks, love practiced in public showed up as: the willingness to build relationships with those who are different than us; seek to understand the motivations of those we deem as enemies; face and transcend our fears together; take care of our health and emotional lives; and work through conflict to cultivate deeper understanding of those around us. **What if we included these qualities in our daily experience, just as much as researching the news, facing injustice, and holding the powerful accountable? How would this enhance our activism?** An ethic of love affirms what we are against, what we don't like, and what needs protecting. Yet it also invites us to take responsibility for translating our rage and anger into possibilities for a more just society and world. *[The Compassionate Rebel: Energized by Anger, Motivated by Love](https://www.amazon.com/Compassionate-Rebel-Energized-Anger-Motivated/dp/0964667649)* is a compilation of stories of 50 people who have experienced physical and sexual abuse, combat trauma, and many types of oppression who have now become nonviolent, social change activists.

It was in prison that he learned Afrikaans, the language of his oppressor while studying their history and reading their favorite poets. Mandela's effort to create a meaningful relationship with South African general Constand Viljoen was perhaps the most inspiring of all. Viljoen was the former chief of the South African Defense Force, which had destroyed dissent in Black townships and assassinated Black activists. White supremacist groups in South Africa were terrified of losing political power in an impending national election. Murders and violence were occurring in the streets between political factions. Viljoen was asked by white supremacist groups to lead an armed insurrection against the government. [https://www.WantToKnow.info/inspiration/beyond-cultural-political-wars-ethic-of-love-for-activism](https://www.WantToKnow.info/inspiration/beyond-cultural-political-wars-ethic-of-love-for-activism) However, like Mandela, Viljoen wanted to avoid a looming civil war. The next thing that happened was interesting. Mandela asked if Viljoen wanted to come over for some tea. By the end of the meeting, Mandela had disarmed Viljoen. This prompted Viljoen to call off the insurrection and persuade other White South Africans to participate in the upcoming election. **A year later, when Mandela was inaugurated as South Africa's President following the nation's first fully Democratic elections, Viljoen stood in the middle of the new parliament, saluted him, and would later call him \"the greatest of men.\" ** *Mandela understood on some profound level that ultimately, whether you are Black or White, right wing or left wing ... Political views are like the dress you wear, but underneath them is a flesh and blood human being. If you cut through those and start finding the heart and appeal to their generosity, you're going to make them feel better about themselves*. - John Carlin, journalist Given the shadowy network of corruption and special interests within US government systems, what Mandela did isn't something that would necessarily work with Big Pharma, or the US military-intelligence complex. Yet what if each of us were to practice this commitment to the greater good in our own lives *now*... with those we disagree with and those in power?

When you step into the victim position by pointing the finger of blame, you short the circuitry in yourself that allows you to feel the natural organic ecstasy of fully standing in a co-creative position with the universe itself. That's the fundamental developmental task we face at this stage of our evolution: opening up the wiring that allows us to feel organic ecstasy for longer and longer periods of time. At present, most people can't sustain the feelings that arise with this opening, so they slip into a dangerous addiction to blame with its corresponding feeling of a gleeful gotcha! Once we're accustomed to a certain internal chemical state, we feel comfortable with that state even if it's attached to really dysfunctional behavior like that glee that arises from apportioning blame. When we try new behavior and our neurochemistry changes, it feels uncomfortable at first. Moving to a new emotional and biochemical state may feel foreign. Even though it may be a healthier one, it is unfamiliar. Usually in couples therapy, the first issue to be addressed is: Are you willing to make a commitment to solving the problem? **One of the most typical responses is, \"Well, I'd be committed if she were.\"** It takes about an hour and a half of discussion to work through that objection, until at some point in the process, both people bond and turn on the leader. I tell my students that those are the only moments during which you're earning your keep as a therapist. Both members of the couple turn to you and say, \"Hey,", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:inspiration__break_the_addiction_blame.txt:0:037d8e16d53e", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 11750, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "inspiration__break_the_addiction_blame.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "inspiration__break_the_addiction_blame", "chunk_index": 1, "text": "a commitment to solving the problem? **One of the most typical responses is, \"Well, I'd be committed if she were.\"** It takes about an hour and a half of discussion to work through that objection, until at some point in the process, both people bond and turn on the leader. I tell my students that those are the only moments during which you're earning your keep as a therapist. Both members of the couple turn to you and say, \"Hey, what the hell are you suggesting here? Are you suggesting that it's not his fault?\" That's always a sweaty moment, but it's the instant when transformation can come. Once you're through that issue, the possibility of getting out of the field of blame and actually taking responsibility opens up. **\"Are you willing to stay completely away from blaming anyone, and instead make a sincere commitment to resolving all the issues we confront?\"** I've asked that question of thousands of people, many of whom had traveled great distances to visit to me, or were paying me very large sums of money. Even with stakes that high, ninety-nine times out of a hundred, the person goes into the default position of blame immediately. Weaning people from that automatic behavior takes a great deal of patience and repetition, and a nimble set of therapeutic interventions. The tendency to default to blame is the huge issue confronting couples and societies today. Wherever you see it appear, that's the area where healing is needed. **There's only one solution, and that's to take 100% impeccable responsibility - and create a space for the other person to take 100% impeccable responsibility as well. Responsibility has a contagious effect.** The initial level of responsibility is going from blame to being willing to consider what you're getting out of - or contributing to - the problem. Senior level responsibility is being so impeccably clear that you become a space into which it's possible for other people to step. You then have to confront a person's despair that the problem is not solvable, which is always accompanied by about fifteen levels of justification. But when both people have made a commitment to resolving the issue, 90% of the work is done. Both people have then stepped into a co-creative role with not only the other, but with the Universe itself. A particular couple comes to mind. They came to work with my wife and me on their relationship. Both partners were Ph.D.s who had written brilliant scholarly papers, but when either of them encountered anything they perceived as a threat, their academic, intellectual understanding flew out the window, and they immediately became convinced that they knew that the other person was wrong. The first thing that we did was to repeatedly ask them if they would be willing to take responsibility for healing, and to make a commitment to solving", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:inspiration__break_the_addiction_blame.txt:1:3598888ce3e5", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 11751, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "inspiration__break_the_addiction_blame.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "inspiration__break_the_addiction_blame", "chunk_index": 2, "text": "with my wife and me on their relationship.

The first thing that we did was to repeatedly ask them if they would be willing to take responsibility for healing, and to make a commitment to solving the issues. When confronted with the question, they would spin out and become more entrenched in the position that it was the other person's fault. They had endless justifications for this certainty, and thus continually dosed themselves with this highly addictive drug. It took all of the first day and well into the night to produce a shift, but in the middle of the night, the husband couldn't sleep. His anxiety got worse and worse. In a state of desperation, he said, \"Okay, I'm willing to commit to solving this problem.\" That created a space for the wife to commit to the same thing. The next morning, they came in willing to solve the problem. In a nutshell, the problem was that she had had a sexual affair and he couldn't forgive her. They'd gone 'round and 'round with it for the better part of a year. On the second day of therapy, the reason he couldn't get over it became really clear. **One of the questions that I commonly ask people is, \"Has anything like this ever happened to you or anyone you know?\"** At first the husband said, \"No,\" but then, as we got deeper into the question, it turned out not only was the real answer, \"Yes,\" but his entire early life had been shaped by his mother running off with another man and leaving his dad with four little boys to raise. It was inevitable that his wife's infidelity, or something like it, was bound to happen to him, because he had it so thoroughly sealed off this early experience. **When we seal something off from our consciousness inside, it has to be brought to our attention in some way by the outside world.** Suddenly, he realized that his wife was illuminating this old experience, and he said to her, \"Oh, you played this role in my life for me.\" At the end of the second day they were in each other's arms. She said, \"This was inevitable. I had to play this role for you.\" And he responded, \"Yes, this was my bad dream you wandered into.\" He asked her, \"Can you forgive me, for getting you involved in this nutty scheme of my unconscious?\" That couple represented one of the best examples I've ever seen of what's possible when both people take responsibility.

There are a lot of programmed-in and even biologically-based characteristics that make human males and females different. I'm interested in what's underneath that. The deeper you go inside, the more human beings look alike. The further you go toward the surface, the more different we look. The fear a woman feels when she's upset about the guy not picking up his socks corresponds to the fear the man feels when he's upset that she's on his case. The superficial differences point to some underlying unity. To deal with these situations, we voice our fears, then look underneath them. As a therapist, I point out repeatedly, \"Okay, having said that your husband is a worthless piece of shit, tune inside. Do you feel happier?\" **The person begins to recognize that although they feel that \"glee-gotcha\" feeling that comes from assigning blame, they don't feel happier.** So I help people make choices about whether something can make them feel happy, rather than just gleeful, by inviting them to make tiny choices that are actually huge choices. I say,** \"Do you choose being right or being happy?\" **I've had people come back months later and say, \"I hated you for asking me that question - but it changed my life.\" And here's the great advantage of asking this question: we each only have to make the choice once. That choice changes the whole playing field. Afterwards, it's simply a matter of practice. It's similar to getting on a bicycle for the first time. You travel ten feet, then wobble and fall over. You get back on and you master going twenty feet. The first time was the moment in which everything changed. It's the same with mastering personal responsibility. **Once a person shifts out of glee and experiences the real joy of claiming responsibility, everything is changed.** They're launched into the process of learning. How do they remember that they're in that process and trigger that experience on a regular basis in everyday life? By discovering how great they feel when they do it, and how miserable they feel when they don't. Twenty-five years ago Kathlyn and I knew we wanted to create something different with our marriage. We looked around to find other couples to model our behavior on, but we found nobody whose relationship we would have traded for our own. We had to make up our path ourselves.

It took a long time, but now it's been the better part of a decade since my wife or I have said one critical thing to each other. It's years since I've experienced blame, since I've had that chemistry in my body. I am past the point where I ever want that drug, because I feel good, and I don't want to bring myself down. We are living in that clear space of impeccable responsibility that offers the possibility for other people to step into it. We choose to be happy. It's easy now. ** Note:** Gay Hendricks is the author or co-author of 25 books in conscious relationship, conscious business, and body-mind transformation.

With very best wishes for healing with dads and parents around the world, [Fred Burks](https://www.WantToKnow.info/aboutus#burks) for [PEERS](https://www.peerservice.org) and [WantToKnow.info](https://www.WantToKnow.info) **Breaking Through With Dad** At age 27, after having spent two adventure-filled years living and teaching English in mainland China, I found myself getting ready to move back to the US. With two years completely immersed in another world away from family and friends, I'd had plenty of opportunities to reflect on my life back home. In those periods of contemplation, **I felt a deep sense of satisfaction in realizing that I had come to really enjoy my relationships with all of my friends and family back home with only one major exception - Dad. ** As a child, I had very mixed feelings about my father. He took us on wonderful, exciting vacations car camping around the country for a month out of each year. In his engaging moments with me and my sister and two brothers, he could be adventurous, enthusiastic, and a lot of fun. Yet like so many fathers out there, most of the time he was distant and unavailable. As a Methodist minister and a fighter for peace and justice, his work was by far his greatest passion with family a distant second. What's more, at meals - our only regular gathering time each day - he would all too often preach politics to us, his unwilling captive audience. There was no debating him, either. He was always right. In looking back, however, **I could see now what I once would never have admitted - that I was just as stubborn as dad.** There was no way I would acknowledge that he was right in a debate or argument. I would argue with him fiercely, yet still he managed to get me", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:inspiration__dad_and_me_healing.txt:0:a7d396966b53", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 11757, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "inspiration__dad_and_me_healing.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "inspiration__dad_and_me_healing", "chunk_index": 1, "text": "time each day - he would all too often preach politics to us, his unwilling captive audience.

In looking back, however, **I could see now what I once would never have admitted - that I was just as stubborn as dad.** There was no way I would acknowledge that he was right in a debate or argument. I would argue with him fiercely, yet still he managed to get me every time. I remember countless times when our interactions ended with me stalking off frustrated and angry, as dad settled back triumphantly into his chair reading the newspaper. Sometimes I just hated him. His righteous attitude seemed so hypocritical and just wrong! After moving away from home at age 18, I had dedicated myself to improving my relationships with my family and others in my life. Thanks to some wonderful divine guidance, I had been successful with everyone except dad. He was the one person I still just couldn't get along with. As I contemplated leaving the wonderfully rich experience in China, I knew that the time had come to change this. I knew that on getting home, if I wanted to get along better with him, my job was to learn to let dad be dad. **I realized that I could not change him, but I could change myself by letting go of my need to be right and of my harsh judgments of him and his behavior. I knew that If I wanted to change our frustrating dynamic, I was the one who would have to change.** The idea came to me that the best way to heal this old family wound was to move in with dad and make a commitment to opening my heart and to becoming friends with him for the first time in my life. I knew it would not be easy. Yet I also knew that if I could hold fast to my intention of not needing to be right and not letting his comments get to me, we could have a significant breakthrough. I wrote dad a letter asking if he was interested in becoming friends, and if he would be open to my living with him on return from China to work on this. **Dad was thrilled at the idea of us becoming friends and warmly welcomed me into his home.** He was very supportive of my desire to move through our difficulties. He even spruced up a little room in his house for me. Yet after a brief, enjoyable \"honeymoon\" period of about two months, I found those same old patterns staring me right in the face again. Dad again was always right and I ended up leaving frustrated, knowing that I was actually right - just like old times. Why did it always have to end up that way?", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:inspiration__dad_and_me_healing.txt:1:be87da6d6058", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 11758, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "inspiration__dad_and_me_healing.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "inspiration__dad_and_me_healing", "chunk_index": 2, "text": "He was very supportive of my desire to move through our difficulties.

I remembered that If I wanted to change this disempowering dynamic, I was the one who would have to change. So gradually, I learned to hold my tongue. When discussion turned to debate, I would do my very best not to engage, not to get caught up in trying to prove him wrong. If the conversation turned competitive, I learned to be quiet and to wait for the appropriate moment to excuse myself, so that I could go let off steam on my own. Even though I still didn't agree with him, I slowly learned to simply listen and to be OK with letting dad have the last word. I couldn't change his behavior or beliefs, but I was gradually changing mine. **Those few months were tough. It's not easy to break deeply ingrained family patterns, but I was committed.** Every time things spun out of control, I reminded myself of my deep intention to become friends with dad and even to love him. By holding strong to that commitment, I got increasingly better at pulling back whenever our talks didn't feel supportive. By the end of six determined months, I had done it! I could sit through a conversation where dad was telling me how I was wrong and feel no need to engage or respond. When he challenged or blamed me, I could just let him have his say. I learned to just acknowledge that I heard him, remembering not to take anything personally and to just let dad be dad. As I got better at this, **I eventually came to understand that dad was not consciously trying to attack me. He was just playing out old patterns and programming within himself.** I could accept and even love him just the way he was - even the part of him that would very rarely admit he was wrong. Dad seemed to notice the difference, too. I especially remember one particular day when dad was doing his thing. I simply nodded my head occasionally and said \"I hear you, dad,\" without feeling any need to defend myself. At one point he fell silent, and I just sat quietly waiting. Then I heard words I don't think I'd ever heard him say in these circumstances, \"Well, Fred, what do *you* think?\" And for the first time in a situation where we didn't agree, I", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:inspiration__dad_and_me_healing.txt:2:cd36c18b8ed8", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 11759, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "inspiration__dad_and_me_healing.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "inspiration__dad_and_me_healing", "chunk_index": 3, "text": "the difference, too.

Then I heard words I don't think I'd ever heard him say in these circumstances, \"Well, Fred, what do *you* think?\" And for the first time in a situation where we didn't agree, I felt dad was really interested in what I had to say. From that point on, though we still would hit occasional rough spots, dad and I began having meaningful conversations. He became increasingly interested in my opinion and his tone of voice lost that cutting edge. For the first time ever, we were actually friends! What an incredibly empowering change in my life - in our lives! I was amazed that although my deep intention was just to let dad be who he was, once I made the big shift, dad shifted, too! What a gift!!! From that point on, our relationship gradually grew warmer and deeper. Many years later for my dad's 70th birthday, I recorded his fascinating life story on over two hours of audio tape. What great, rich stories he had! What a wonderful, bonding time we shared!!! We've gone on to become very good friends who truly enjoy spending time together. And he strongly supports all the work I'm doing with PEERS. What a long way we've come! Thanks, dad, for being such a wonderful presence in my life. And I give thanks for the divine guidance which helped me to realize that if I want to transform any significant relationship in my life, I can stop trying to change others and open to accepting and loving everyone just as they are. **By focusing on making shifts and changes in myself, I now know without a doubt that I alone can positively change any relationship in my life.** **Note:** For two other inspiring stories and one awesome video of powerful healing and connections between father and son, [click here](https://www.weboflove.org/inspiring_stories_12/hoyt_team_rick_dick) and [here](https://www.inspiringcommunity.org/inspiringstories0506#1).

From [interpreting for presidents](https://www.WantToKnow.info/050418fredburksinterpretingstories) to helping dying patients as a hospice nurse to transition from this world; from being involved in several incredibly loving, nurturing communities to developing rich and meaningful relationships with some of the most knowledgeable and inspiring individuals in the world; from helping people to better understand all that's going on [deep behind the scenes](https://www.WantToKnow.info) in our world to [a fascinating article](https://www.WantToKnow.info/050226fredburkswsj) about my transformative work being published on the front page of the *Wall Street Journal*, my life has been incredibly fun, rich, and exciting. One simple, yet very memorable example of a small miracle happened a number of years ago. I was resting on the comfortable bed in my hotel room after a particularly enjoyable day of serving as an Indonesian language interpreter. As I relaxed there, I began to experience an uncomfortable pain in my stomach. I knew that physical pain often has its roots in deeper emotional or spiritual realms, so I explored within myself and managed to find and shift what I suspected was the underlying cause of this pain. As soon as I did this, the pain disappeared. In that magical moment, **I felt so grateful that I sent out a heartfelt message to the universe that I wanted to give something back as a way to express my gratitude for all the joy and countless gifts that I've been given in my life.** Almost immediately, the idea came into my mind to share the simple life principles I had learned early on, which are a major reason my life has been so deeply fulfilling. Thus was born the inspiration to write \"Simple Keys to a Fuller Life,\" which I share with you here below as way to express my gratitude. May this essay in some way touch and inspire you to live an ever richer and fuller life. With profound gratitude and wishing you ever more love, joy, and fulfillment in your life, [Fred Burks](https://www.WantToKnow.info/aboutus#burks) for [PEERS](https://www.peerservice.org) and [WantToKnow.info](https://www.WantToKnow.info) P.S. Just a note that I've had some serious challenges in my life, too. Yet by applying the principles below to the difficulties that have shown up, almost always they have turned into rich learning experiences for which I feel so much gratitude. Some of my most deep and powerful experiences came from big challenges that were completely transformed. And note that this is a two-page summary.

For the full eight-page essay, [click here](https://www.weboflove.org/keystolife). ** Simple Keys to a Fuller Life** ** What's Best for All** **The Power of Choice**. Every one of us makes countless choices every day. Every choice we make has an impact on our lives. Even insignificant choices can affect what we experience and how we feel. When hunger strikes, we can reach for a healthy, nutritious snack, or we can choose the sugar high of junk food. The more important the decision, the more profound its effect. For instance, how do I act towards that person who treated me badly? Do I generally choose to be passive, or do I actively [set clear intentions](https://www.weboflove.org/lifepurposeintentions) and create what I want in my life? Every choice we make, however big or small, affects us in some way. **How Do You Make Choices?** If you're interested in living a richer, fuller life, there is a foundation upon which you can base all of your decisions which can make life better not only for you, but also for those around you. This foundation is to choose based on what's best - what's best for you and for all of us. Imagine if every parent, spouse, friend, teacher, businessperson, and politician truly did their best to choose what's best for all involved in every decision they made. We would certainly live in a more caring, supportive world. **It's the Intention**. \"But how do I know what is really best?\" you might ask. The answer is simple. It doesn't matter. What matters is not the choice you make, but rather the intention behind your choice. What matters is that whatever decision you make, you are clear in your intention of choosing based on what's best. If it later turns out that you made what appears to have been a bad choice, there's no need for guilt. Knowing that you did your best to choose with a sincere desire for what's best for all involved, your conscience stays clear and open. This then allows you to more easily learn from your mistakes, and to live with a clear heart and mind. **What's Best for Me, Too!** Choosing what's best does not mean you have to always sacrifice yourself for others. An overly exhausted mother can lose her temper easily. Some time off for this mother might seem selfish, yet in the long run, it can help her to be a better mother to her children. So as we move through each day of our lives, let us remember to include ourselves as we do our best to choose what's best for all of us.", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:inspiration__express_my_gratitude.txt:1:2fc966b08409", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 11763, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "inspiration__express_my_gratitude.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "inspiration__express_my_gratitude", "chunk_index": 2, "text": "Me, Too!** Choosing what's best does not mean you have to always sacrifice yourself for others.

So as we move through each day of our lives, let us remember to include ourselves as we do our best to choose what's best for all of us. ** Divine Guidance** **Many Meanings for Divine.** Guidance can come from many sources. Yet by opening to guidance from the divine, we open to the support of powerful forces greater than ourselves. The divine has different meanings for different people, whether it be God, Creator, Jehovah, Allah, or Great Spirit. Yet even if you don't believe in any of these, consider the possibility that there is a very wise part of yourself - a higher self or a deeper self - which can provide you with guidance. What is important is that we open to this presence, however we choose to define the divine, and that we consciously invite this powerful guidance into our daily lives. **All Requests Only if it's Best. **When seeking divine guidance with a specific result, be sure to end with \"only if this is what's best.\" There are times when what's best is not what's easiest or most enjoyable. Sometimes unwanted or unexpected challenges, difficult situations, and even pain can teach us important lessons that in the long run help us to enjoy life more fully. When we choose to see all experiences as gifts from the divine and opportunities for growth and understanding, we open to a deeper level of divine guidance. ** Acceptance and Compassion** **Our Core Essence. **Deep down we are all beautiful beings [worthy of love and support](https://www.momentoflove.org). The sweet innocence of babies and young children is a clear example of this. Yet for most of us, the shining essence with which we came into this life became obscured over the years as our family and others were unable to give us the kind of unconditional love and support we so craved. As children, when we were repeatedly told that we were not good enough or were punished just for being who we are, thick layers of confusion and doubt developed, clouding our divine essence. Layers of fear and insecurity were woven into our personalities. **The Mask. **By the time we are grown, most of us have developed a protective mask or persona to hide these layers of fear and insecurity from others, and at times even from ourselves. Outwardly we might appear happy or content, yet on the inside most of us to varying degrees feel unhappy with who we are. Yet beneath it all, that [shining essence](https://www.weboflove.org/050614shortinspiringpoems) is still there. No matter how much we may have forgotten, no", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:inspiration__express_my_gratitude.txt:2:af3aa1f15420", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 11764, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "inspiration__express_my_gratitude.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "inspiration__express_my_gratitude", "chunk_index": 3, "text": "woven into our personalities. **The Mask. **By the time we are grown, most of us have developed a protective mask or persona to hide these layers of fear and insecurity from others, and at times even from ourselves.

Yet beneath it all, that [shining essence](https://www.weboflove.org/050614shortinspiringpoems) is still there. No matter how much we may have forgotten, no matter how thick those overshadowing layers may be, our beautiful core essence is and has always been there. **Acceptance and Compassion for Myself. ** By choosing to accept and have compassion for all of who you are - both your deep shining essence and the layers of dark clouds within - you can invite that beautiful inner essence to shine through the clouds and to shine again in your life. When fears, dark thoughts, or difficult emotions arise, first choose to accept that they are there. Then open to finding compassion for these dark clouds and where they came from. Ask for divine guidance as you explore and [transform these dark places](https://www.WantToKnow.info/coreissue). **Courage. **It takes courage to accept and have compassion for our fears and weaknesses. Yet by doing our best to be fully ourselves in all our strengths and weaknesses, our relationships can grow richer, deeper, and more meaningful. This may be challenging, as some people are unable or unwilling to accept certain parts of us. Yet as those around us see us becoming more real and honest with them, many will also be inspired to be more real and honest with us. Thus, instead of continually avoiding or denying those clouds or dark layers in both ourselves and others, we open to a deeper, more authentic way of living and of relating to others. **Acceptance and Compassion for Others. **As you develop greater acceptance and compassion for yourself, you will notice that others, too, have lost touch with their shining core essence. As you work to accept and find compassion for yourself, it is most important that you choose also to [give this gift](https://www.weboflove.org/transformation#seeing) to those around you. Acceptance of what is, coupled with compassion and discerning what we can change and what we cannot, allows us to find the courage to be all that we can be, and to empower others in doing the same. ** Love and Empowerment** **Let me start with myself.** I will do my best to love and empower myself to be the best I can be every day of my life. By making this commitment to yourself, it becomes easier to love and empower those around you. But do you really want to give this gift to all other people? What if you really don't like someone?

By making this commitment to yourself, it becomes easier to love and empower those around you. But do you really want to give this gift to all other people? What if you really don't like someone? In this case, you can remind yourself that it is usually a person's personality that you don't like - the mask or dark clouds blocking their deeper essence. Remember that beneath the mask is a shining divine essence. While acknowledging those parts you don't like, do your best to empower the shining being hidden beneath the mask or personality that you don't like. You can choose to love and empower the divine spark within all. **Negative Judgment.** Judging someone to be bad as a person does not empower or inspire anyone to be a better person. When you find yourself feeling negative judgment, first acknowledge the part of you that wants to judge - the part that wants to be right or better than others. Then do your best to learn from your judgment and let it go. Open to finding first acceptance, and then compassion and love both for you and for the person you judged. Choose to let your last thought always be that of love. **Stopping harm.** What if someone does something that is clearly wrong or causes harm? In this case, be firm and take whatever action you feel is best to stop harm. Enforcing a serious consequence with someone who has acted out of extreme self-interest may be the most loving, empowering action you can take. Yet even as you take action, open to seeing the inner turmoil that causes people to do harm. You can act from a place of love and compassion, even while firmly stopping someone from doing wrong or causing harm. Through choosing to see beneath all of the pain, suffering, and hatred, and to recognize and [connect with the divine essence](https://www.weboflove.org/wingmakers#seeing) within even those who would do us harm, not only do we heal the world, we heal ourselves. **Imagine...** Imagine a world where all people truly did their best to love and empower each other.

We could also hold our intelligence agencies accountable for their longstanding history of funding and supporting repressive far-right regimes all over the world. Perhaps most importantly, we could begin addressing the predatory corporate practices and government policies responsible for the extreme levels of financial inequality holding our entire society back. No matter who we vote for, each of us has the responsibility to work with our fears in the face of complex issues that lack clear answers.

May this story encourage all of us to find peace with our past.

I'm both excited and scared at the possibility of starting college here at Yale in the fall. I sit on the warm grass, and my heart swells, hoping that I'm embarking on a wonderful new adventure. Less than one year later, I'm walking past that same patch of grass, having just purchased three more packages of junk food from the vending machine. It's time to study, but I can't concentrate anymore without cigarettes and sugar. The binge eating has begun, and the weight gain and depression with it. This adventure has had its heavy burdens. I'm losing touch with the bright-eyed girl from the summer before, who had such high hopes. The difficulties during those college years deepen with each passing year. Even in the many years afterward, my memory of Yale serves as a touchstone. When people ask where I went to college, I hunch my shoulders a bit, make myself just a little shorter and mumble, \"Yale.\" And then there are the dreams - weekly sometimes - from which I awaken anxious and with shortened breaths. I am back at Yale, lost and disoriented, experiencing a strange combination of past and present events. I am there feeling the same confusion I am passing through in much of my life. I am without an anchor called myself. I start to get spiritual and psychological help in my 30's. Yet even as freedom increases in my life, there is still this burden that I identify with my college years. The occasional \"Yale dream\" continues to hold those memories (and myself) hostage. Then one day, my old college roommate calls me. She invites me to our 25th Yale reunion. I exclaim to her, \"You've got to be kidding; I hated Yale, why would I want to go back?\" She begs, offers financial assistance, says she won't go without me. I sleep on it, considering her generous offer. Could this possibly be an opportunity? After one more Yale dream, I decide to go.

I sleep on it, considering her generous offer. Could this possibly be an opportunity? After one more Yale dream, I decide to go. It will be a spiritual pilgrimage, I tell myself, to reclaim the lost part of me that seems left behind in those haunting courtyards of New Haven. Once there, I make the commitment to be fully present to each experience, without pretense, as an antidote for the disavowing of myself those many years ago. To my pleasant surprise, on immersing myself in the reunion crowd, I find I am with people who are similarly unguarded, and the miracles begin to flow easily. Sara, radiating sunshine and beauty, tells me: \"Every five-year reunion I return and get back a little bit more of me each time.\" Those first years for women at Yale so intimidated many of us with larger than life expectations we felt we couldn't live up to. Yet now Sara is shining her radiance on me. There is Alex, who took 20 years to be open about being gay. And Jim, dancing the night away with abandon, even as he grieves the imminent death of his mother, lying comatose in a hospital nearby. Each contact seems to open another little chamber of my heart, unleashing tears of both joy and sadness. During two full days of learning, laughing, dancing and singing together, I am able to reframe old memories, create new ones, and the unthinkable occurs: I am finding peace. On the quiet flight home, I actually think about the positive gifts from my years at Yale, possibly for the first time ever. My love of learning was fostered there, along with writing, performing and many other skills I use often in my life. I had been carrying my college days around with me like Linus' blanket, dusty and dirty and filled with bad odors, masking the truth. Now, Yale is simply back there in New Haven. Having faced it again with all the strength of mind and heart I could bring, I have put my once-disturbing memories back into the past where they belong. Now when I look at the original yearbook pictures of the Class of '75, I still see a lot of serious faces and sunken eyes. Yet remembering the radiance in my classmates' faces at the reunion, I realize that we've all done a lot of good living these past 25 years. We're resilient and strong. Our hearts have healed and expanded. We've \"arrived\" - not in terms of status or accomplishments, but in finding our way home to ourselves.

Edgard Gouveia Jr., 58, says the key to solving the world's problems is games. \"I use games and narrative to mobilize crowds,\" says the Brazilian game inventor and co-founder of [Livelab](https://www.livelab.org.br/en/). He's worked with schools, companies, government offices and slums. And his target audiences keep getting bigger. \"For example, games that can make a whole town, a whole city or even a whole country play together,\" he says. And now he's developing a global game called \"[Jornada X](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-ysPJkka4M)\" whose goal is to get kids and teenagers to save nothing less than all life on the planet. Gouveia's thinking is that if you can frame a problem as a challenge or epic journey, then kids \"can solve a lot of problems that adults can't,\" he says. \"And they're able to mobilize the adults among them.\" NPR sat down with Gouveia to discuss his ambitions to crowdsource and gamify the solving of big problems and how games grabbed a hold of him as a boy. This interview has been edited for length and clarity. **When was the first time you realized that games could be used to achieve something big?** When I was a kid, we had this game called *gincana*. In Brazil, it goes back like 100 years. Fewer communities play it today, but you can still find maybe 30 cities in Brazil where it's played. Here's how it works. Once a year, the whole town or city was invited to play together. We created teams of 500 or 600 people that included kids and adults and grandparents. It was like a big weekend festival. And we played silly, impossible missions. There was actually a commission that created these missions. **What's an example of one of these missions that community members would compete in?** I remember the first one that I played in my hometown of Santos. There was this stage in front of the church where the whole town of thousands of people gathered to hear what the mission was. And the guy said into the microphone, \"You have three hours to bring a real pink elephant.\" There are no wild elephants in Brazil. And there's certainly no pink elephant anywhere!

And the guy said into the microphone, \"You have three hours to bring a real pink elephant.\" There are no wild elephants in Brazil. And there's certainly no pink elephant anywhere! But when the guy said we had three hours, the whole town started screaming and running, trying to find a solution. This is an ancestral training system that awakens and strengthens the power of community because you cannot complete the mission by yourself. After five minutes, someone in the crowd said, \"The circus!\" Then his team ran and drove to the circus in another city. And the owner loaned them the elephant because everyone knows that the *gincana* is something sacred. Everyone wants to help you. So he probably said, \"OK, take it, but bring it back in three hours! Please! Because I have a show.\" This team thought they were going to win since they had the elephant. \"Nobody's gonna find a pink elephant. We're the amazing ones!\" But another team brought an elephant from another town and they started painting it pink. The first team said, \"No! You can't do that!\" But the second team said, \"Nobody said you couldn't paint a real elephant pink.\" So people created these crazy strategies out of nothing. And we did it together. It's a kind of collective intelligence... a brainstorm the size of a city. And then we all laughed. We all celebrated. Even if you lost, you couldn't believe these groups actually brought real elephants to your town. As a boy, I witnessed the creative potential we have to solve anything. **What gets in the way of solving big problems today, do you think?** There's a mindset that leads us to create scarcity in our behavior with our neighbors, with our partners, with other countries. It's the idea that there's not enough for everybody. So we feel like we better collect and save for ourselves and for our families. But this idea of scarcity is crazy. It creates a kind of social sickness. You can be a millionaire but if you have the idea of scarcity in your head, you'll want to collect more and save more. **The people that often share the most are the poorest people. If you give someone who's homeless a sandwich, they will share it. They know that tomorrow, they won't have food. And if they share with someone now, that person may share with them tomorrow. All over the world, the homeless people I've met have a different kind of knowledge.** Most of us in big cities, we see the other as a competitor or a potential enemy. But for many traditional communities, if they see you", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:inspiration__games-to-save-the-world.txt:2:d2a8caddee72", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 11777, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "inspiration__games-to-save-the-world.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "inspiration__games-to-save-the-world", "chunk_index": 3, "text": "most are the poorest people. If you give someone who's homeless a sandwich, they will share it. They know that tomorrow, they won't have food. And if they share with someone now, that person may share with them tomorrow. All over the world, the homeless people I've met have a different kind of knowledge.** Most of us in big cities, we see the other as a competitor or a potential enemy. But for many traditional communities, if they see you coming and they never saw someone that looks like you before, they'll find the difference attractive. \"Oh, it's a potential friend,\" they might think. So they want to feed you, learn from you, bring you to their home. **So how do you shift this mindset of scarcity?** It's not about trying to educate people out of it because for them, it feels true. They've experienced that scarcity. You cannot manipulate people's will. But you can manipulate or design the environment so that scarcity isn't important. What I do is help build skills in others that I've learned from traditional communities, Indigenous villages or observing kids in nature. I just tell people, \"Let's play.\" And through games and playful activities, we create a field of trust, of safety, of love and empathy. And people wind up wanting to give more and more. When you create abundance of connection, abundance of possibility, people sense it right away. It doesn't matter if for 30 or 40 years they were living in scarcity. When our biology finds an abundance of love, connection and an acceptance that we can be ourselves, people flourish within minutes. **How do you create this abundance through your organization Livelab?** Collective intelligence and collective action are way more powerful than a traditional pyramid or hierarchy. We're trying to tune back into a community's power to bring people together. And we do that through this guiding question: What if building the world of our dreams could be fast, free, fun and fantastic? If you think about inviting the whole world to take on a big global challenge, the United Nations can't do that. But the Olympic Games can. The World Cup can. We have so much knowledge, especially in Indigenous communities, about how to treat the environment and how to build connections among thousands of people. If you can create a challenge where you invite all of humanity to join a journey that's fast, free, fun and fantastic, everybody is going to join - kids and elders alike. I've done it locally, regionally and nationally. But to take on climate change, we need to go global. **Describe your vision for the global game you're building.** It's called \"Jornada X\" in Portuguese, or \"X Journey\" in English. And the idea is to save the planet - a forest, a piece of a neighborhood - one block at a time.

And the idea is to save the planet - a forest, a piece of a neighborhood - one block at a time. It starts with young people. They receive a call that's like a Matrix video that says, **\"Humanity isn't doing well. Society is violent and nature is dying. But you are one of a group of special kids with superpowers - things like love, helping others, strength, and friendship. **In this game, in this journey, you have to awaken and release your superpower. **But here's the key - it has to be a collective superpower.** They have to call at least three more friends and convince them to form a team. And anyone who joins that league gets the superpower as well. Kids love playing superheroes as a team. As soon as they sign up, the team starts to receive missions. For instance, we might say, \"Look at your neighborhood around you. What pisses you off about your neighborhood? What's wrong?\" Kids and teenagers are all about criticizing. So they choose something like not having trees or having a dirty river or kids not being safe. And the idea is that by the end of seven weeks, they have to find a solution and build it alongside their community. They don't know how to begin, but they try. We tell them that the whole neighborhood is their game board. We explain that everything that they need to solve the problem is there in their community. So they have to find the local experts, the local materials, the local organizational patterns. And eventually, they come up with something... like planting trees or cleaning gardens or cleaning the river. **How does the broader community get involved?** The next mission might be to find allies in your neighborhood - people who know about the problem you're trying to tackle. We ask the young people to choose the best three experts, tell them about the problem they're trying to solve and ask them to share the story of their lives. That's a trick to create connection. These allies have the wisdom but they sometimes feel stuck and that they can't do anything. But when kids go to them, it energizes them. Soon, we ask the kids to mobilize the support of as many adults as possible to get them involved in the hands-on work of their solution. And when the community sees kids healing their neighborhood, they come together and say, \"There's something meaningful here. We need to be part of it.

And when the community sees kids healing their neighborhood, they come together and say, \"There's something meaningful here. We need to be part of it. We've been waiting for the government or companies to support us, but we are the people who can act to restore our neighborhood.\" By belonging to a group that we love and that's doing good in the world - these are ways of energizing our collective power, our collective meaning. When you do some good, you feel like you have an identity. Your neighbor says, \"Amazing. How can I support you?\" You feel appreciated and so you want to do more. By playing the game, we strengthen our personal and collective portions of confidence, joy, and willingness to do good. **You really think this could work?** **Well, kids play war games all the time. They collaborate to kill people. It's not that they like death, but they want to have this kind of adrenaline. What could be more exciting? My answer is saving the planet in a way that adults haven't been able to.** Our global game is a way to get communities to come together and use hands-on actions to restore the environment. By doing that, they reconnect with nature, reconnect with society and they want to do more. They dance together, they celebrate together, they share food, and it's fun. It restores community. We've been testing it [in](https://youtu.be/CHTHmx18gME) [Brazil](https://youtu.be/595uxnkv0fc) and over 15 countries. And the kids are telling us they want to build this huge network across the planet. So it's coming. It's coming.

Start by sitting quietly with yourself. Take a few slow, deep breaths while inviting your mind to settle down. Just notice and feel your breath for a minute or so. Feel your heart beating. Notice what you are feeling. Find and open to the place in your heart which only wants to love and be loved. Allow this energy to flow through your body. Connect with the hearts of others. As you go through the day, look for the heart in each person you meet. Imagine and connect with the place in them that wants only to love and be loved. When you wake up in the morning and just before going to bed at night, open to doing this and to feeling your own heart and the place within that just wants to love and be loved. Think of a few people that you believe are beyond help like T.J. Ware in the story.

This year's election along with our other complex challenges are shaking up society and putting our relationships to the test. Here's the good news. **We hold the power to heal the polarization poisoning our conversations.** The latest neuroscience shows that the brain is designed to rewire itself with conscious thought-opening up to new ways of seeing and making sense of our lives and the world. This essay challenges all of us to tap into our deeper consciousness, examining the beliefs and narratives fueling our collective struggle to heal polarization. We also explore inspiring remedies and stories that build strong communities and reimagine activism for a healthier society. **What's beyond entrenched divisions and familiar narratives?** Shifts away from polarization are already happening. Researchers in Poland [found](https://www.wanttoknow.info/a-poland-appears-torn-abortion-research-hints-divide-isnt-so-deep) that people from across the political spectrum feel much more empathy and openness to dialogue on the divisive abortion issue than their elected leaders do. Journalist and author Batya Ungar-Sargon traveled all across America, engaging with everyday people to understand their views on politics, culture, and the economy. Communities across the country were more diverse and open to viewpoint diversity than she had previously thought. Contrary to mainstream media narratives, she found [deep consensus](https://www.rnz.co.nz/national/programmes/afternoons/audio/2018934485/how-class-not-politics-is-dividing-america) on the most important issues between working class Democrats and working class Republicans. This shared humanity can break through even the deepest divides. Jane Goodall [attributed much of her success as an activist](https://www.wanttoknow.info/a-jane-goodall-champions-pragmatism-progress-national-geographic-documentary-jane-goodall-hope) to building meaningful relationships with the corporations and scientists contributing to animal welfare abuses and environmental destruction.

America, and all cultural entities, are in search of a soul.* - Howard Thurman The Greek word agape was a moral imperative defined by Martin Luther King Jr. as the willingness to go to any length to restore and strengthen community. King [declared](https://www.beaconbroadside.com/broadside/2017/08/martin-luther-king-jrs-where-do-we-go-from-here-sermon-50-years-later.html#:~:text=He%20who%20hates%20does%20not,not%20love%2C%20it%20means%20nothing) that he had decided to love. He testified that love is the highest good, and \"the key that unlocks the door to the meaning of ultimate reality.\" He called on the \"creative dissenters who will call our beloved nation to a higher destiny, to a new plateau of compassion, to a more noble expression of humanness.\" An ethic of love affirms what we fear, what we are against, what we don't like, and what needs protecting. Yet love also invites us to move beyond resistance and fear. Love challenges us to take responsibility for translating our sense of injustice into creative possibilities for a world beyond the distresses of oppression and fear. **Instead of viewing the work as a conflict between \"us\" and \"them,\" we engage in a principled struggle to collaborate and build authentic relationships *regardless of our differences.*** **How an Ethic of Love Can Reshape Activism and Society** *Being a victim of oppression in the United States is not enough to make you revolutionary. **People who are full of hate and anger against their oppressors or who only see Us versus Them can make a rebellion but not a revolution.** The oppressed internalize the values of the oppressor. Therefore, any group that achieves power, no matter how oppressed, is not going to act differently from their oppressors as long as they have not consciously adopted different values.\"* ― Chinese American civil rights and labor activist Grace Lee Boggs Social activist and poet bell hooks [frequently wrote about the need for a strong love ethic](https://uucsj.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/bell-hooks-Love-as-the-Practice-of-Freedom.pdf) among progressive communities and activists. She observed how many people resist domination only when their own interests (or the interests of their tribe) are threatened, rather than seeking a broader transformation that ends all forms of oppression and domination. For instance, she highlighted how the Black Power movement of the sixties, which initially sought to foster love and inclusivity, shifted towards a focus on power through the use of domination and force. This led to an increasing emphasis on identity politics, which fractured social justice movements into one-dimensional", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:inspiration__healing-culture-wars-one-conscious-conversation-at-a-time.txt:1:8a4b499cffee", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 11789, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "inspiration__healing-culture-wars-one-conscious-conversation-at-a-time.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "inspiration__healing-culture-wars-one-conscious-conversation-at-a-time", "chunk_index": 2, "text": "many people resist domination only when their own interests (or the interests of their tribe) are threatened, rather than seeking a broader transformation that ends all forms of oppression and domination.

This led to an increasing emphasis on identity politics, which fractured social justice movements into one-dimensional issues and individual group identities like race, gender, political tribe, or class. Broader economic and social justice goals that could bring us all together beyond [tribal grievances](https://www.wanttoknow.info/inspiration/transcending_tribal_mentality) were sidelined. Going deeper, **the profound grief and pain rippling throughout society was suppressed and replaced with militant activism that avoided the appearance of being weak or powerless, and prioritized material goals over building a strong community.** As Joanna Macy, a thought leader on environmental and social transformation, once reflected, \"the refusal to feel takes a heavy toll. The energy expended in pushing down despair is diverted from more creative uses, depleting the resilience and imagination needed for fresh visions and strategies.\" When the US government [infiltrated and manipulated these activist movements](https://peerservice.substack.com/p/the-uncensored-history-of-the-assassination), these communities turned against each other instead of towards each other. Would this have happened if love and community had been at the center of these progressive efforts to build more collective power? King once said that \"power without love is reckless and abusive, and love without power is sentimental. Power at its best is love implementing the demands of justice, and justice at its best is power correcting everything that stands against love.\" *I want there to be a place in the world where people can engage in one another's differences in a way that is redemptive, full of hope and possibility. **Without an ethic of love shaping the direction of our political vision and our radical aspirations, we are often seduced, in one way or the other, into continued allegiance to systems of domination.** The ability to acknowledge blind spots can emerge only as we expand our capacity to care about the oppression and exploitation of others. A love ethic makes this expansion possible.* - bell hooks When opposing views are treated as existential threats, it becomes more acceptable to use domination to assert moral or ideological superiority. The aim isn't genuine understanding or resolution, but rather to critique, silence, or \"win\" against perceived enemies. This dynamic feeds into a deeper fear of losing power, identity, or societal influence, making domination seem necessary to protect one's worldview from being challenged or destabilized. This consciousness often operates below the surface, even when we have good intentions and a deep commitment to democratic principles. Yet its impact on the social polarization we're feeling is clear. *The hardest thing is facing yourself. It's easier to shout \"Revolution\" and \"Power to the People\"", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:inspiration__healing-culture-wars-one-conscious-conversation-at-a-time.txt:2:b0973845c877", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 11790, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "inspiration__healing-culture-wars-one-conscious-conversation-at-a-time.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "inspiration__healing-culture-wars-one-conscious-conversation-at-a-time", "chunk_index": 3, "text": "silence, or \"win\" against perceived enemies.

It's easier to shout \"Revolution\" and \"Power to the People\" than it is to look at yourself and find out what's real inside you and what isn't ... when you pull the wool over your own eyes, your own hypocrisy. That's the hardest one.* - John Lennon Culture wars are creating [massive, unhealthy tensions within progressive organizations](https://theintercept.com/2022/06/13/progressive-organizing-infighting-callout-culture/). These critical groups are facing an unprecedented standstill because they're spending too much time fighting each other. The social minefields within the broader culture wars have resulted in a [growing number of people self-censoring](https://www.wanttoknow.info/a-more-than-half-americans-think-first-amendment-provides-too-many-rights), including experienced medical professionals who [fear cancellation](https://www.wanttoknow.info/a-this-isnt-how-good-scientific-debate-happens-academics-culture-fear-gender-medicine-research) for discussing their views on treating children questioning their gender identity. Perhaps this is an appropriate response to how relentlessly we're bombarded with harmful and simplistic labels like white supremacists, woke left, sheeple, anti-vaxxers, anti-science crusaders, conspiracy theorists, racists, transphobes, misogynists, and countless others. These labels reduce us to ideological constructs, sabotaging authentic communication by stripping away context and nuance. **The end result is that we've become more counter aggressive, defensive, and fearful of each other.** When we weaponize labels to discredit or make others wrong, we marginalize and alienate people-reinforcing an \"in-group\" versus \"out-group\" mentality. Traveling peacemaker and founder of [nonviolent communication](https://www.wanttoknow.info/inspiration/nonviolent_communication_summary_nvc) Dr. Marshall Rosenberg once said that \"the more people are trained to think in terms of moralistic judgments that imply wrongness and badness, the more they are being trained to look outside themselves-to outside authorities-for the definition of what constitutes right, wrong, good, and bad.\" *I am convinced that men hate each other because they fear each other. They fear each other because they don't know each other, and they don't know each other because they don't communicate with each other, and they don't communicate with each other because they are separated from each other.* - Martin Luther King Jr. Transformational leader Meg Wheatley [teaches us](https://margaretwheatley.com/books/turning-one-another/) that **labels result in us knowing less about each other, but assuming we know more.** Some initiatives attempt to foster understanding across our divides, yet still use divisive labels that diminish this goal. One example is [Ground News](https://ground.news/), which promises to help people fact-check stories and spot media bias by categorizing news from a variety of sources as Left, Center, or Right.

While Ground News claims to uncover partisan biases, this approach actually reinforces partisan biases by assigning more importance to partisan labels than to the content of the news. While it's valuable to see what different political sides are reporting, genuine media literacy involves more than sorting news into partisan boxes. Concerns about vaccine safety or censorship aren't solely \"far-right\" issues, and addressing war or racial injustice isn't limited to the \"left.\" **Viewing issues through a partisan lens keeps us confined to ideological boxes and distracts us from understanding the multifaceted nature of complex societal issues.** *As these traditional touchstones of meaning in life, family, faith, friendship, community, have been on the [decline] in recent decades, **more and more people have found their ultimate meaning in political issues. Now it's easy for people to feel like their very identity is being assaulted because of that disagreement, because their identity has been misplaced in a public and political issue.** Democracy depends on reasonable, deliberative discourse and conversation and debate. And if people are constantly being thrown into fight or flight mode, we're not doing democracy well. We're not doing life together very well. We take one aspect of who a person is and extrapolate that: \"OK, that's all I need to know about who you are and what you stand for.\" But that's so reductive and it's degrading to the dignity of the human person.* - ['A disposition of the heart': Exploring the power of civility to heal divides](https://www.wanttoknow.info/a--disposition-the-heart-exploring-power-civility-heal-divides), *Christian Science Monitor* Braver Angels [creates intentional spaces](https://www.wanttoknow.info/a-betterangelsorg-bridging-political-divide) for Red and Blue participants to better understand one another's positions and discover their shared values. This work has produced transformative outcomes in bridging divides. While it plays a crucial role in society, it still gives power to labels and defines our interactions based on those labels. I imagine a future where simply being present with each other becomes the ground for our interactions. **Meeting each other in the moment, human to human, we co-create connections from an open space: Curiosity. Wonder. Taking deep breaths. Noticing something we haven't noticed before. Trusting the process.** Austrian-born Israeli philosopher Martin Buber describes this quality of presence: \"Every living situation has, like a newborn child, a new face, that has never been before and will never come again. It demands of you a reaction that cannot be prepared beforehand. It demands nothing of what is past. It demands presence, responsibility; it demands you.\" **The Consciousness Shift That Brings Us Together** [I've collaborated with a lot of different personalities, across diverse efforts and social movements](https://www.amberyang.love/).

I've spent countless hours talking with people all over the political, religious, and cultural spectrum. As a result, I no longer feel hopeless about our future. **Here are the core insights I've come to trust deeply:** It's not our differences that divide us; it's the judgment about our differences. People and issues are far more complex than the labels and boxes we often place them in. We all want to be seen, heard and acknowledged. Things move at the speed of trust. Creative energy and authentic dialogue explodes when we focus on the values that we share. Smith College Professor, feminist, and civil rights activist Loretta Ross [built unexpected yet transformative relationships](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/19/style/loretta-ross-smith-college-cancel-culture.html) with Ku Klux Klan members and incarcerated men convicted of serious crimes against women. Over the years, much of her activism has focused on healing cancel culture: the readiness to alienate and dehumanize a person on the basis of their beliefs. Instead of calling *out*, she offers tools and insights to call people *in* with love and respect. When asked what is lost when we lose nuance in a world where everything is seen as either black or white, [here's what she had to say](https://atmos.earth/calling-in-macarthur-fellow-loretta-j-ross-cancel-culture/): *The biggest loss is depth. I think there's a tendency to oversimplify because we are exhausted by the thought that things may not be as they appear. In our hairy life, where everything is trying to grab our attention, we tend to gravitate towards those things that simplify life for us. * The second is the loss of integrity and a sense of self. Calling in is not what you do for other people-it's what you do for yourself. **It gives you a chance to offer love, grace, and respect, and to showcase one's own integrity and one's own ability to hold nuance and depth.** People mistakenly think that you're doing it because you're trying to change somebody else. That's not possible. People have to make the decision to change themselves. But what you can do is provide them an opportunity to do so. And since we don't have the power to control and change others, the only power we're left with is self-empowerment: the power to choose how we walk through the world. In this sense, calling in is a conscious decision to not make the world crueler than it needs to be. We're all capable of using a technique I call \"the mental parking lot\" where you temporarily put aside any visceral reactions you have to", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:inspiration__healing-culture-wars-one-conscious-conversation-at-a-time.txt:5:a2d73f894f6b", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 11793, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "inspiration__healing-culture-wars-one-conscious-conversation-at-a-time.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "inspiration__healing-culture-wars-one-conscious-conversation-at-a-time", "chunk_index": 6, "text": "them an opportunity to do so.

In this sense, calling in is a conscious decision to not make the world crueler than it needs to be. We're all capable of using a technique I call \"the mental parking lot\" where you temporarily put aside any visceral reactions you have to what others are saying. It's a technique that requires you not to pay attention to your reaction but rather to devote your focus and respect to the person you're talking to. It's hard at first because many of us want to get into a debate and persuade those with opposing viewpoints that they're wrong. But quite often, if you can achieve that technique of parking your own reactions and giving them attention-**this can be done by using simple phrases like, \"tell me more\" or \"how did you arrive at that conclusion?\"-then you get a glimpse into their life's journey that has cultivated this perspective.** Generally speaking, once you extend an invitation to a dialogue, then you condition them to better listen to your perspective. Instead of a fight, you have a conversation. Imagine if we radically shifted our conversations to frame every issue or topic in ways that bring us all together and highlight our common values. A new consciousness that integrates the best of the intellect (ideas, stories, beliefs, our version of the facts) with the relational world. **To relate is to get present with others, relax our fears, listen, and ask questions to deepen the conversation.** This may not always produce perfect results. Yet if enough people take the risk to relate to each other differently-to take the dehumanization out of our interactions and not see each other as enemies-we just might create new possibilities and choices we couldn't see before. *A wave of local democracy is sweeping across Europe. Assemblies are public meetings where local people get together to discuss and decide on a specific issue, without political interference or hidden agendas. These assemblies can help us fundamentally rethink how we make decisions in our society, and create strong, active communities in the process. To survive ecological breakdown and the collapse of our failing economy, we need both, urgently. The culture war has gained a lot of ground. Overcoming these divisions is one of our biggest, most pressing challenges. **Through assemblies, it's possible to form self-organising communities where we lift each other out of the conditions that these ideologies prey on.** Where we are forced to work alongside people we disagree with or even dislike, and organise positive initiatives that feed us, lower our energy bills, give us purpose and contribute to a stronger community spirit.

In all our wanderings away from the Divine, humankind has virtually eliminated its most compelling features through misapplication of the logical mind, and through persistent belief in a language of limitation arising out of the controlling mechanisms of the hierarchical paradigm. Within this paradigm, language has often been used by those who desire to exert control to impose a form of limitation. Though in relative terms their words may appear liberating and empowering, those in power in the hierarchy have often used language as an instrument of entrapment and tyranny. At the other end of the spectrum, some of the noblest efforts of humanity in the usage of language have resulted in the Divine being gradually illuminated by the great spiritual visionaries of our world. Yet even the images portrayed by the language of these inspiring leaders cannot help but dilute the pure expression of the most compelling features of the Divine. **The Divine dances outside of the constructs of any language. It is complete within itself, and has a singular purpose of expressing the collective potential of all life in the universe.** It is the archetype of perfection.

It is the standard bearer of each soul's innate design and ultimate destiny. The essence of the Divine is far beyond mental conception, yet humanity's tendency is to resort to the limiting language of the hierarchical paradigm to define and understand it. **The Hierarchical Paradigm ** Within the many-layered hierarchies so prevalent in many aspects of this world, those in high positions of power have attempted to guide the development of all humankind. In so doing, they have subtly obscured the direct connection between the individual and the Divine through layers of limiting language, belief system manipulation, and confining rituals designed to intercede between our inner essence and our divine source. **Each individual can come to know themselves to be free of all forms of external control. This is not to imply that we should not trust others or join together in bonds of friendship and community. It is simply a reminder that relative truth is constantly shifting in the hands of those who desire to control. **And even when the motive for their controlling behaviors may be of good will, it is still a form of control. When the revealers of \"Truth\" within the hierarchy withhold and suppress information, they are usually positioning themselves to maintain or acquire more power rather than to disseminate empowerment to all. There are so many confusing and seemingly contradictory layers of relative truth that most individuals surrender much of their power to those in the hierarchy who use language to proclaim absolute truths. Language is seductive both to the ego's drive for power and control, and to the mind's inclination to surrender to, and believe in, the limiting language of external truths. Those desiring to control use language to lure the unsuspecting into believing in compelling images and ideas - real or imagined - for the sake of holding individuals in bondage to a lesser truth. They can thus cause many to support the hierarchy even when it no longer serves their deeper purpose. The hierarchical paradigm represents diverse interests, perceptions of reality, and motives of action. It is the desire to contain and control this diversity that causes the hierarchy to become ineffective in leading individuals to awareness of their divine heritage. Yet this diversity is also what permits it to attract and initially awaken such a breadth of individuals to their spiritual energies and intuitive abilities.

Nevertheless, the hierarchy has trapped itself in vested specialization and in the limiting aspects of diversity that prevent it from evolving from an arduous ladder of evolution to a joyous river of light that is aligned with the purpose of empowering all souls to divine equality. The time is fast approaching when the veils of control at all levels of the hierarchy will be rendered obsolete. It will become the fundamental purpose of those in power within the hierarchy to slowly remove these barriers to equality in such a way that the hierarchy appears to be the savior of consciousness rather than a detour from the road to expanded consciousness. Yet there are those present who will ensure that the curtain falls swiftly for all who are willing to skirt the hierarchy's tangled pathways, and who embrace their sacred heritage as [transformed expressions of the Divine](https://www.WantToKnow.info/transformation). **Searching for Connection and Wholeness** **After consciousness initially enters a human body, it is fragmented into a physical, emotional, and mental spectrum of perception and expression. From the day of birth onward, human consciousness is conditioned to adapt into, and navigate within the limited three-dimensional, five-sensory context of the Earth. In effect, the soul purposely fragments its consciousness in order to experience separation from wholeness. ** The desire to evolve consciousness derives from the feeling of being less than whole, and in particular, the feeling of being disconnected from the Divine due to the fragmentation of consciousness. It is through these feelings that the fragmentation perpetuates itself and is passed into the genetic mind, which is the shared foundation of humanity. The collective genetic mind of humanity is the single most powerful component of the hierarchy. It is formed by the very conditions of living in a three-dimensional, five-sensory context that is all consuming. The desire for salvation results from feelings of inadequacy that constantly surge within the collective consciousness of humanity through the genetic mind. These feelings are again related to the fragmentation of individuals, and to their consequent inability to fully grasp their holistic nature, to reach into their divine origins, and to accept their divine equality with all. Thus ensues the seemingly endless search to be saved from the inadequacy and insecurity that result from the fragmentation of consciousness. In this state of separation, human consciousness has handicapped itself for the purpose of gaining new experience and a deeper understanding of the primal blueprint or grand vision of the Divine. **Once we develop a more expanded level of experience", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:inspiration__hierarchy_equality.txt:2:d4a399b30294", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 11799, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "inspiration__hierarchy_equality.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "inspiration__hierarchy_equality", "chunk_index": 3, "text": "fully grasp their holistic nature, to reach into their divine origins, and to accept their divine equality with all.

In this state of separation, human consciousness has handicapped itself for the purpose of gaining new experience and a deeper understanding of the primal blueprint or grand vision of the Divine. **Once we develop a more expanded level of experience and understanding, our consciousness one day will, through the human body, transform this three-dimensional reality into a self-aware, integrated component of the universe.** This magnificent and purposeful endeavor produces within us the urge to seek out our wholeness and re-experience our divine connection to All That Is. The desire for connection and wholeness, in large measure, is the fuel that drives us to seek out and explore both evolution and salvation within the context of the hierarchical paradigm. It provides us with the motivation to seek help and guidance from a specific group within the hierarchy, and in so doing, cultivate a sense of connection, belonging, and unity. It is this very sense of connection, belonging, and unity that fosters a growing awareness of the underlying union between you, your divine essence, the world around you, and All That Is. This is why the hierarchical paradigm is essential as a component of the grand experiment. It is why feelings of inadequacy and insecurity are developed and nurtured by the hierarchy. **The hierarchical paradigm is a key stage where, faced with inadequacy and insecurity, people eventually develop a sense of belonging and unity, a sense of connection to some grand, encompassing vision. This is also why the hierarchy nurtures saviors who point toward a greater vision.** These perceived saviors can facilitate the unification of all people, which in turn, facilitates the integration of humanity with the Divine. **The Prophet's Journey** Insightful spiritual leaders are able to peer deeply beneath the surface reality of life and experience how intricately connected every life form is, and how the composite of all life is intelligent far beyond an individual's capability to both perceive and express. These visionary leaders can thus interpret this deeper reality through their personal abilities to perceive and express life's dimensional depth and limitless intelligence. Yet no one is able to articulate life's full dimensional depth and breadth with the tools of language. They can only, at best, describe their interpretation or their impressions. In actuality, all of us are able to peer beneath the surface reality of life and perceive a unique vision of the universe. We require only time and intention to develop our own interpretations. And this is precisely what many great spiritual leaders have taught. **Life's deeper essence is not an absolute to be experienced by the chosen few, but an evolving, dynamic intelligence that wears as", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:inspiration__hierarchy_equality.txt:3:c152e3e07b72", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 11800, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "inspiration__hierarchy_equality.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "inspiration__hierarchy_equality", "chunk_index": 4, "text": "of language.

No group or people has the exclusive portal into the universe by which the Divine expresses itself in all its majesty. **The portal is available to all, because [the Divine is within all things](https://www.weboflove.org/wingmakers#seeing). The great spiritual visionaries of Earth have all, in their own way, interpreted the universe and humanity's role therein. They produced a dynamic vision of life and the universe beyond what was currently defined within the hierarchy. Each of these great prophets or saviors thus created a new portal into the universe and were willing to share their vision knowing well that debate and probable ridicule would follow. These men and women were the gateways for humanity to explore new facets of itself, to engage a part of its oversoul or collective consciousness that was essential at that particular time in its evolutionary cycle. Yet the visions of these great leaders, because they were articulated with authority and depth of insight, became a target of debate among various subgroups of the hierarchy. This debate then created a polarity of belief. A sympathetic constituency emerged to defend and embellish their particular leader's interpretation, while most established groups held it in contempt of previously held beliefs. Eventually, the leader's interpretations became confined and shaped into rigid dogma by followers who desired to create a new religion or sect. Thus, this infusion of fresh insight quietly receded into the hands of the hierarchy, where its deeper meaning became obscured by the very fact that it was incorporated into a massive structure that both protected and promoted it. Divine intelligence is connected to individuals and not organizations. Thus, the hierarchy is disconnected from the Divine in a vital and dynamic way. The hierarchy is connected to its own collective desire to help, to serve, and to perform a function that allows the use of power to drive toward the vision of its leaders. In itself, this is not wrong or misguided. It is all part of the primal blueprint that orchestrates the unfolding of consciousness from divine wholeness to sovereign soul, and from sovereign soul to collective wholeness.

What the hierarchy has loosely labeled as spirit comes as close as any word to the essence of divine intelligence. Divine intelligence inhabits all realities as an extension of the Divine. It is the emissary of the Divine that interweaves with the hierarchy as its counterbalance. Divine intelligence is the factor of integrity and alignment, which ensures that the hierarchy is serving its purpose within the primal blueprint. Divine intelligence is, in effect, the \"scientist\" who oversees the grand experiment. It establishes the criteria, selects the variables, monitors the results, and evaluates the alternative outcomes in the laboratory of time and space. The grand experiment is the ongoing transformation and expansion of divine intelligence through all beings in all dimensions of existence. It is the purpose of the grand experiment to test alternative paradigms to determine, with some certainty, the paradigm that is best able to unify consciousness without impinging on the sovereignty of the individuated soul. The grand experiment is composed of many distinct stages that interlink, leading to the great mystery. Most of these different stages are being simultaneously played out within the time-space universe in order to prepare the universe for the impending expansion of divine consciousness into all forms and dimensions of existence. **The Transformation Paradigm: Inner Wisdom and Understanding ** In the case of the Earth, a new paradigm is currently emerging that promotes a clear connection of individual consciousness to the compelling features of the Divine without the intervention of a hierarchy. This is when the fables and myths of history step into the light and become known as they were originally intended. This is the time when language will be transformed into a new form of communication that exhibits the compelling features of the Divine in an artistry of energy and vibration that breaks down all barriers of control. It is time to recognize that the hierarchy extends throughout the cosmos to the very borders of discovery. It has branches that extend from every star system and from every known dimension. Virtually all life forms are \"leaves\" of this vast cosmological tree. This constitutes the grand indoctrination of species, spirits, planets, and stars as they each evolve through the branches of the tree. Thus, the hierarchy is an assemblage of externally oriented individuals who desire to invest their energies in support of a subgroup that has nested somewhere within this greatest of all manifest structures. Service is a driving force within the hierarchy, and in most cases, this translates into the concept of salvation and the teacher/student ordering of the universe. The hierarchy", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:inspiration__hierarchy_equality.txt:5:43d1779cca00", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 11802, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "inspiration__hierarchy_equality.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "inspiration__hierarchy_equality", "chunk_index": 6, "text": "constitutes the grand indoctrination of species, spirits, planets, and stars as they each evolve through the branches of the tree.

Service is a driving force within the hierarchy, and in most cases, this translates into the concept of salvation and the teacher/student ordering of the universe. The hierarchy is composed of all individuals of all motives that have linked their energies into subgroups. These subgroups form independent branches of the vast, cosmological tree that encompasses all things that appear to be separate from the Divine. The roots of the tree are bound in the soil of genetic memory and subconscious instincts. At the base of the tree the first branches sprout. They are the oldest, representing the native religions of the species. The middle branches are the orthodox religions and institutions, while the upper branches represent contemporary belief systems that are newly emerging throughout the manifest universe. The whole tree, in this definition, is the hierarchy, and its seed was initially conceived, planted, and nurtured by divine intelligence for the purpose of stimulating the grand experiment. This is the experiment of comparing personal transformation through self-mastery with the hierarchical paradigm's evolutionary process. Evolution is the arduous and ongoing process of shifting positions within the hierarchy - always assessing one's present position in relation to a new one that beckons. **The transformation paradigm is initiated simply by the recognition that rather than the dependency-inducing ways of the hierarchical paradigm, there are accelerated, independent pathways that bypass the hierarchy and lead to self-mastery, and that these new pathways can be accessed through direct experience of the tone or vibration of divine equality that is present within all of us. ** This tone or vibration is not what is commonly referred to as the music of the spheres or the vibration of spirit moving through the universe in resonance to divine intention. It is rather a vibration that becomes evident through the practice of three [principles of transformation](https://www.WantToKnow.info/transformation): seeing the Divine in all, nurturance of life, and gratitude. The application of these life principles disengages a soul from the controlling elements of the hierarchy, thus initiating the transformation experience. **Free Will** How can the hierarchy act as an interpretive center of truth without manipulating souls, and thus obscuring their free will? **The grand experiment was designed with free will as its primary method of obtaining authentic information that can be used to expand divine intelligence into all dimensions of existence. **Free will is the thread of authenticity that imbues value in the various tests within the grand experiment. The hierarchy never jeopardizes free will. Only the soul can choose its reality. This is the fundamental principle of free will. Free will", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:inspiration__hierarchy_equality.txt:6:b779ead4fc6c", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 11803, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "inspiration__hierarchy_equality.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "inspiration__hierarchy_equality", "chunk_index": 7, "text": "truth without manipulating souls, and thus obscuring their free will? **The grand experiment was designed with free will as its primary method of obtaining authentic information that can be used to expand divine intelligence into all dimensions of existence. **Free will is the thread of authenticity that imbues value in the various tests within the grand experiment. The hierarchy never jeopardizes free will. Only the soul can choose its reality. This is the fundamental principle of free will. Free will is not obscured simply because an individual is presented with alternative realities or relative truths that delay its realization of divine equality. It is the choice of each soul to what extent it invests itself in external accounts of reality. The choice is always available for the soul to delve within its own resources and create a reality that is sovereign. The value of free will is always expanding as an individual moves towards personal transformation, and in like manner, is always diminishing when moving towards external dependence. The choice between personal transformation and external dependence is the basis of free will, and there is no structure or external source that can eliminate this basic choice. It is an inward choice that, regardless of outward circumstance, is incapable of being denied by anything external. The universe encompasses all dimensions, and therefore, all realities are contained therein. In this incomprehensible diversity, each soul is presented with structures that define its free will in terms of its relationship to the Divine. Each of these structures varies in latitude of choice, but each is connected into the superstructure of the hierarchy. The structureless reality of divine intelligence is where free will was initially conceived. This principle was woven into the physical world as the thread of authenticity. It's degree of influence is determined by the soul's ability to recognize its own wholeness in relation to the Divine. When people are unknowing of their inner wholeness, they tend to look for security outside of themselves. Uncertain of their place within the structured and ordered world around them, they often define themselves based upon their insecurities. Individuals thus become only pieces of their wholeness and like shards of glass from a beautiful vase, they bear little resemblance to their aggregate beauty. If the soul perceives itself as fragmented into its component parts, its comprehension of free will is limited to that which the hierarchy circumscribes. If, however, the soul is clearly known to be a conscious collective, realizing its sovereign wholeness, then the principle of free will is a form of structure that becomes unnecessary, like a fire on a summer day. If you were to perceive the origin of your existence, you would undoubtedly see how vast the soul is. If you could pierce through the veils that cover your destiny, you would understand how much more vast you will become. Between these two", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:inspiration__hierarchy_equality.txt:7:6abfc22e5439", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 11804, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "inspiration__hierarchy_equality.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "inspiration__hierarchy_equality", "chunk_index": 8, "text": "If, however, the soul is clearly known to be a conscious collective, realizing its sovereign wholeness, then the principle of free will is a form of structure that becomes unnecessary, like a fire on a summer day. If you were to perceive the origin of your existence, you would undoubtedly see how vast the soul is. If you could pierce through the veils that cover your destiny, you would understand how much more vast you will become. Between these two points of existence - origin and destiny - the soul is always the vibrant container of divine intelligence. It has willingly allowed itself to explore the time-space universe as an outpost of the Divine. Therefore, while the hierarchy may obscure the soul's comprehension of its wholeness, it is the soul who has surrendered, by choice, to listen to the language of limitation and the proclamations of external truths, and to become seduced by the hierarchical paradigm. Why has the hierarchy not provided the alternative paradigm of personal transformation, thus enabling the individual to make more conscious choices and more fully exercise its free will? It is because the hierarchy, like most individuals, is not aware of its own wholeness. Its fragments, or subgroups, are often obsessed with boundaries. Where there are rigid boundaries that define and limit, there is also structure. Where there is deeply ingrained structure, there is a pervasive belief that self-mastery attained through the development of inner wisdom and understanding is impossible. As the time-space universe conforms to the [matrix of belief projection](https://www.WantToKnow.info/wingmakers#beliefsystems), the very concept of self-mastery through personal transformation has largely been removed from the hierarchy's reality. Thus, the hierarchy is unable to even conceptualize the transformation paradigm with any precision, let alone inform the soul that alternatives exist which issue from divine intelligence. The hierarchy is not responsible for this condition, each soul is. The paradigm of divine intelligence is primal. It existed before the hierarchy. **It is the soul that has chosen to explore the hierarchy's paradigm for the purpose of participating in the grand experiment and assisting in the emergence of a synthesis paradigm. **The hierarchy is quite benign as a manipulative force. It merely represents one stage in the journey toward wholeness. This sacred journey eventually transforms the soul to reach beyond its role as a vibrant container of divine intelligence to become a bridgeway for the expansion of the Divine into the physical world. **The Descent of the Divine into the World** There is an ancient belief, born of the hierarchy, in a great future ascension from the physical world into divine reality, and that humans of love will accompany this ascension process. Yet in the greater scheme of life, it is the Divine that is expanding to encompass the physical world with the purpose of aligning all souls to a new paradigm.

Yet in the greater scheme of life, it is the Divine that is expanding to encompass the physical world with the purpose of aligning all souls to a new paradigm. Divine intelligence is stripping away the veils that hide the essential meaning of the soul in the physical world. As this progresses, the soul increasingly realizes its divine equality with all, and its many facets become increasingly aligned, allowing for an ever fuller expression of its transformed perspective. This transformation of the soul through self-mastery is the pathway into wholeness. It is the recognition that the soul is a composite of forms and the formless that is unified in one energy, one consciousness. When the fragments are aligned and interconnected, the soul becomes the instrument that facilitates this divine expansion. Thus, **the soul does not ascend from the physical world, but rather coalesces into a state of wholeness whereby its transformed expression can assist in the expansion, or in a different context, the descent of the Divine into the world.** Ascension is often construed as the natural outcome of evolution. In this view, all planetary systems and species are evolving to the point where they ascend from limitation, and eventually, the reality of the physical world will somehow fold into the Divine and cease to exist. In the greater reality, however, it is quite the opposite. The Divine is descending. It is inclusive of all things. It is divine intention to expand, not retreat. The soul transforms to wholeness within the cradle of the physical world, and in so doing, becomes a catalyst to the Divine's intention to expand. Can you see the perfection of this primal blueprint? Can you feel the shifting of the matrix from which your reality is cast? Can you not also understand that you, as a human being, consist of both a formless and formful identities that are individuated as a single point of pure energy, yet live in many places on many dimensions simultaneously? Only within the soul is the place of deep transformation discovered, where the formless self can enter and commune with its various outposts of form. The formless self is the eternal watcher who lives beyond the veil of form and comprehension, and draws forth the wisdom of time from the well of planets. It is the point of origin from whence divine intelligence flows. The eternal watcher, sometimes alluded to as the higher self or deeper self, is the divine interpretive center for the soul. As a pure conduit of divine intelligence, the eternal watcher is the only stable guidance system that can propel the soul to", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:inspiration__hierarchy_equality.txt:9:00ab43409dac", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 11806, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "inspiration__hierarchy_equality.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "inspiration__hierarchy_equality", "chunk_index": 10, "text": "self is the eternal watcher who lives beyond the veil of form and comprehension, and draws forth the wisdom of time from the well of planets.

As a pure conduit of divine intelligence, the eternal watcher is the only stable guidance system that can propel the soul to its wholeness. Thus, the soul is composed of both a formless identity infused with divine intelligence and a formful identity expressing as densified energy. While the formless is one, the formful is divested in many fragments of expression that isolate its consciousness as islands of perception and expression. This condition results in the soul's inability to recognize the vast and glorious nature of its existence. Upon entering a human body, the soul is largely silent and unmoving. It appears like a fleeting whisper of gladness that touches you like a mountain wind. It is quiet like a deep ocean. Yet the soul is coming forward into the world as a harbinger of divine expansion. It is beginning to make its divine essence known. Many now feel the shadow of their soul as it approaches. They consign all forms of definition to this \"shadow,\" seldom believing it to be the torchbearer of their total selfhood. Here is where all the vows of faithfulness, all the ceremonies of love, and all the feelings of hope can be centered and given over to the divine essence that we each are. The primary reason that the hierarchical paradigm is so compelling is because the soul has become fragmented in how it perceives its total selfhood. The eternal watcher that lives through the human being is thus elusive to the time-space conditioned mind. Yet it is the mind that attempts to reach out and touch this subtle vibration of divine equality that is forever kindled by divine intelligence. However, the human mind is too conditioned to focusing on the fragments to realize the total scope of the soul that exists beyond the shadows of intuition. It is for this reason that humanity is exploring a hierarchical paradigm based upon evolution and salvation. Most humans have little or no conception of their wholeness, and require a savior and the acclimation process of evolution to bring them security and happiness. It is a natural condition of evolving groups and individuals to have a desire, implanted by the hierarchy, to be saved or to be a savior. This condition results in the teacher/student ordering of reality. It is a building block of evolution and the very essence of the hierarchy's structural existence.

The salvation drama is an expression of souls that are preoccupied with the evolutionary process, and this is not confined to a religious context, but indeed applies to all facets of one's life. As there are relative truths, there are relative freedoms. As individuals evolve through the hierarchical process, an ever increasing sense of freedom is gained, yet external forces continue to exert control through limiting language, confining belief systems, excessive dependence upon the physical senses, and the seemingly indelible artifacts of the genetic mind. Each of these controlling influences can lead to continued reliance upon the hierarchy as it unceasingly attempts to impose a sense of inequality between us. **The underlying equation of the hierarchical paradigm is: individual + hierarchy = God connection. In the case of personal transformation, it is: individual + divine intelligence (accessed through inner wisdom and understanding) = divine equality with all. ** Divine intelligence, though it manifests as the vibration of equality, is subject to the will of the Divine. And as divine intention changes through the various stages of the grand experiment, divine intelligence is also changing its form of manifestation. This change is occurring now within the worlds of time and space because divine intelligence is beginning to set the stage for the integration of the two primary paradigms within the grand experiment. **The Synthesis Paradigm: Integration ** The time has come to integrate the dominant paradigm of the hierarchy with the transformation paradigm of divine intelligence. This integration can only be achieved at the level of the soul. It cannot occur within the context of a human body or an aspect of the hierarchy. Only the soul - the integral manifestation of the wholeness of interdimensional consciousness imbued with divine intelligence - can facilitate and fully experience the integration of these two paradigms. This form of integration occurs naturally once the individual has fully explored the two paradigms and develops a synthesis paradigm whereby salvation is attained through the intention of the soul to \"save\" itself, and not rely upon external sources to perform this liberating task. This act of self-sufficiency begins to integrate the salvation idea with self-realization. The next step is to integrate the time-based incremental model of evolutionary progress with the realization-based model of the transformation paradigm. This is done when the soul is thoroughly convinced that experience and expression of its wholeness can only occur when it is no longer dependent on the various structures of the hierarchy.

Once individuals take responsibility for their own salvation and integration, it does not mean that the hierarchy is to be shunned or avoided. The hierarchy is a wondrous instrument. It is symbolic of the body of the Divine, enabling it to submerge within the physical world similar to how the human body allows the soul to function in the physical world. The hierarchy is a vehicle of transformation even when it acts to suppress information and keep groups in obedience to its controlling hand. It is part of the ancient formula that prepares a new world for the synthesis paradigm and eventually leads to membership in the greater universe. **It is the combination of release from dependency on the hierarchy and salvation from within that initiates the synthesis paradigm into manifestation. ** The synthesis paradigm is the next outcome of the grand experiment, and in certain vibrational fields of the multidimensional universe, there are individuals who are indeed experiencing this stage of the experiment as forerunners of this expanded form of divine individuation. These individuals are specifically called to transmit this future experience into communication symbols and life principles that facilitate the bridging of the two paradigms. Beyond the initial design and construction of these \"bridges,\" these people will remain largely unknown. If they were to do anything more, they would rapidly become a fixture of the hierarchy and their contributions would become compromised. These transformed individuals are not present in the physical world to be formal teachers. They are present to be catalysts and designers. They are present to ensure that divine intelligence is allowed to balance the dominant force of the hierarchy. Their interest is not in creating a new belief system. Instead, they will focus on developing new communication symbols through various art forms that facilitate the soul's detachment from the controlling aspects of the hierarchy. These people will also demonstrate the natural ease of interweaving the two primary strands of existence into a synthesis paradigm. What these individuals will be doing, in effect, is to transform the time-space universe from hierarchical ladders of consciousness into inclusions of the Divine. In other words, divine reality will be extended into the physical world, and all life forms herein will experience this extension through a transformed hierarchical structure that is fully aligned with divine intelligence. What some call \"heaven on earth\" is merely the echo of a realization of this impending future time. **What is currently bearing down on the time-space universe is the", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:inspiration__hierarchy_equality.txt:12:aca334518f95", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 11809, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "inspiration__hierarchy_equality.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "inspiration__hierarchy_equality", "chunk_index": 13, "text": "in effect, is to transform the time-space universe from hierarchical ladders of consciousness into inclusions of the Divine.

What some call \"heaven on earth\" is merely the echo of a realization of this impending future time. **What is currently bearing down on the time-space universe is the expansion of the Divine through the accessibility of divine intelligence information to all souls regardless of form or structure. ** **Awakening** Once this information is accessible to all, every soul will eventually be inexorably drawn in this direction. And once each individual's inner spirit then becomes fully awakened, all souls will become part of the synthesis paradigm. What is being set in motion now in the physical world is the initial preparation for these paradigm shifts. More specifically, upon the Earth, these paradigms will be simultaneously played out over the next epoch of time. As always, it will be the choice of each one of us as to which paradigm we embrace in our journey. In the advancing epoch of human development, new pathways beyond this synthesis paradigm will be collectively designed so that a transformed hierarchy can be constructed that is consciously fashioned from divine intelligence information. This new structure will be cast from the knowledge gained from the grand experiments of the time-space universe, and the cosmic cycle will regenerate itself into a new, expanded manifestation of reality. This new paradigm resists definition. Words are inadequate to describe even the shadowy outlines of this new form of existence that is emerging from out of the synthesis paradigm. These various paradigms generally occur in a predetermined sequence, but not necessarily in a predetermined timeframe. The sequence of the divine expansion is: divine intelligence creation of a new reality; the ongoing development of a soul constructed hierarchy to act as the superstructure of the new creation; the emergence from the hierarchy of a dominant paradigm; the introduction of the divine intelligence paradigm; the integration of these two paradigms to form a synthesis paradigm of divine equality; and finally, divine expansion to the inclusion of all dimensions and souls. When this sequencing of the primal blueprint is achieved, the process with all that has been learned will be reconfigured, and a new element of the primal blueprint will be revealed that is unknown at this stage even by divine intelligence. The time required to fulfill the complete cycle is undetermined, but it is reasonable to expect that its completion is yet so distant in time that to attach measurement would simply be a feeble attempt at estimating the unknowable.

Let there be no mistake, however, that the fulfillment of the primal blueprint is indeed the direction all souls are traveling. While all souls, as inspired manifestations of the Divine, are bestowed free will within their own realities, their ultimate destiny is not a matter of free will. The origin of all souls lies in the realm of divine intelligence, and it is divine intelligence that determines destiny as well. Yet souls are provided a tremendous latitude of choices to propel themselves from origin to destiny, and to reemerge into an expanded version of reality with a renewed vision of their own identity. All of the highest imaginings of humanity are yet unaware of the deepest foundation of the primal blueprint. We have sought the upper reaches of the building, yet remain unaware of the foundation's design. It is here, at the very core of existence, that the Divine is bursting forth with its creative energy. Yet it is simultaneously reintegrating with its invitation to wholeness. It is here that equality is realized, not in the lofty places of relative truth lodged in the hierarchy, but rather in the deepest part of the foundational plan of life's original source and ultimate destiny, where time reintegrates itself into timelessness. **The origin and destiny of existence is the tone of equality in life. [Listen for this tone](https://www.weboflove.org/wingmakers#seeing) - this frequency of vibration - and follow it back into the very foundation from whence all things arise and return. ** Consider these words as symbols only.

On a whim, I decided to approach him. Right on queue, he asked for money. \"Spare change for the homeless?\" \"I'll give you a quarter if you tell me your story,\" I countered. He laughed wryly. \"You'll give me a quarter for my story?\" I lay the quarter in front him and changed my mind, \"Nah, I'll give you a quarter anyway, but it would be nice to hear your story.\" I followed his befuddled eyes to the shiny quarter, and for a brief moment, I saw a glimmer of reflection as he became quiet. So I sat down next to him and waited. \"I was in the army,\" he eventually said in a low voice. \"Was a sniper... was supposed to shoot the enemy dead from the distance.\" He seemed about 50 years old. He was wearing dirty old rags that smelled like a dead rat left in a mouse trap. I listened intently to his grizzly voice as he dwelled deeper into his story. He told me how when he was young, he used to hunt with his family and was really good at it. He had his own way of respecting animals by not wasting what he killed for food and not killing more than he needed. When the army came knocking on his door, he felt pride. The skills he had developed over all those years of hunting for food could now serve him in protecting people from the bad guys. He was excited for the first time to feel a real sense of purpose in his life. He proudly set out to fight in Iraq. It wasn't long, however, before he realized his ideals of fighting to protect his country were just a shadow of the truth. He was quickly disillusioned with the random killing of what he was convinced were mostly innocent people. He couldn't find any real justification for it. \"You see, I was a sniper. But I never really killed anyone,\" he said. \"But then one day, I had to do it. They were right on me telling me to shoot this lady in the distance. In my gun's scope, I could see clearly what must have been the lady's kids right by her. My hands were trembling on the trigger as they kept barking orders at me to kill her.

Not only that, he told me how he was dishonorably discharged and then black listed by the military, so that he couldn't even get a regular job. All the rights we take for granted were stripped from him. Why? How could this be? The irony of it swirled through my head. Here was a man who was being punished - and for what? For refusing to kill a lady? For being a hero? \"I have no regrets,\" the homeless man reflected. \"I may be homeless now, but I never killed that lady. I never killed no one in the army. It didn't smell right. I didn't go there to kill innocents.\" After a moment gazing off into the distance, he added, \"I can live with being homeless - that's okay. But I wouldn't be able to live with killing innocent people.\" On that suddenly poignant Friday night, I had no doubt that I had just met a hero. I just never would have expected that the hero would be this smelly, bickering homeless guy left on the street by his own country to beg for his life after committing an incredible act of bravery. **Note:** This story was originally published in [Positive News](http://positivenewsus.org) and reprinted with permission of the author, [Rishi Oswal](http://rishio.com).

That's a lot of people! But did you know that the pessimistic predictions of a few decades ago that a population bomb would drive humanity over the cliff of self-extinction are turning out not to be true? As the world gets wealthier and more secure, the desire for having many kids is dropping. The average number of children per woman has been declining rapidly for decades. According to official [UN Data](http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.DYN.TFRT.IN),** the average number of children per woman worldwide for 1962 was 5.0.

It connects us to the world. It plays a role in listening, in language, in understanding speech in noisy places, in walking, and even in our feelings toward one another. Rhythm is much more than a component of music. We experience the rhythmic changes of the seasons. Some of us have menstrual cycles. We have circadian rhythms - daily cycles of mental and physical peaks and troughs. Tides, 17-year cicadas, lunar phases, perigees, and apogees are other naturally occurring rhythms. Human-made rhythms include the built world - street grids, traffic lights, crop fields, mowed designs in baseball diamond outfields, the backsplash behind the kitchen counter, spatial patterns in geometric visual artforms. Rhythms in the brain have been called out as a basis for consciousness itself. Even in very young children, being (literally) \"in sync\" with another person engenders positive feelings toward them. **Music in general, and rhythm in particular, does an uncommonly good job fostering a sense of community. Indeed, music being played at negotiation sessions helps to smooth the conversations and leads to breakthroughs and compromises**.

His first project began in 2007 [in the Mexican city of Culiacan](http://pedroreyes.net/palasporpistolas.php). **As part of a campaign to curb shootings, the city collected 1,527 guns. He used them to create art. \"Those 1,527 guns were melted and made into the same number of shovels,\" he says. \"So for every gun now, there's a shovel. And with every shovel, we planted a tree**.\" Now Reyes is working on a new project. It is one that transforms guns into something more musical. An exhibition of the work is on display at the University of South Florida's Contemporary Art Museum. It's called \"Disarm,\" and consists of guns that have been [turned into musical instruments](http://pedroreyes.net/disarm.php?szLang=en&Area=work).\" To me at least,\" Pedigo says, \"the concept is about taking weapons that are destructive in nature and chaotic and trying to make them for something else. So, instead of objects of destruction, they become objects of creation.\" That's exactly Reyes' point. Art, he says, is about transformation. \"It's the same metal,\" he says, \"but it is no longer a gun. It's now a flute or a guitar.\" **Note:** Don't miss the [incredible pictures](https://www.npr.org/2014/01/25/265794611/artist-transforms-guns-to-make-music-literally) of Reyes' latest inspiring project. **Why Our Movements Need to Start Singing Again** **December 4, 2022, *Common Dreams*** [read on WantToKnow.info](https://www.wanttoknow.info/a-why-our-movements-need-start-singing-again) **Social movements are stronger when they sing.

In [Momentum](https://www.momentumcommunity.org/), a training program that I co-founded and that many other trainers and organizers have built over the last seven years, song culture is not something we included at the start. And yet, it has since become so indispensable that the trainers I know would never imagine doing without it again. We developed a session within Momentum devoted to reviving song culture. We named it \"Why did we stop singing?\" This module teaches how to bring more music to our movements by breaking down common barriers like self-consciousness, discomfort with vulnerability, and lack of a shared repertoire. Once Momentum began incorporating it into its curriculum, \"Why did we stop singing?\" quickly became one of the most popular parts of the training. Over several years, many of the organization's trainers and leaders worked to develop the module and, as they did, some important lessons emerged. Chief among them: Music is a powerful tool that we have too often neglected in our organizing-and members of our movements are hungry to bring it back. The training was designed to promote a more sustainable culture of direct action, as well as to put traditions of mass protest in dialogue with longer-term models of structure-based organizing. **Note:** The above was written by Paul Engler, a co-founder of Momentum Training, which instructs hundreds of activists each year in the principles of effective protest.

Dancing was also seen to improve blood pressure, insulin sensitivity, physical fitness, cognitive disorders, hypertension, cardiovascular ailments, diabetes, and mental health-in other words, all the root causes of the non-communicable diseases that kill most people in the West. The researchers believed that dance would be a more ideal form of exercise because it is sustainable-it's a sociable, entertaining way of exercising that participants will enjoy, rather than a drudgery they have to push themselves through. \"Dance is effective on fat loss in people overweight and obese and has a significant improvement on body composition and morphology,\" said Zhang Yaya, a Ph.D. student at Hunan University, China. To get their results, published in the journal PLoS ONE, the team studied data from 646 participants who were overweight and obese across ten different studies. **They found that dance is very effective for improving body composition and showed that more creative dance types had the most pronounced body composition improvement when compared with traditional dance.** Improvements were also found in overweight children and patients with Parkinson's disease. **Note:** Explore more positive stories like this in our comprehensive [inspiring news articles archive](https://www.wanttoknow.info/inspirationalnewsarticles) focused on solutions and bridging divides. **Learning His Body, Learning to Dance** **November 25, 2009, *New York Times*** [read on WantToKnow.info](https://www.wanttoknow.info/a-learning-his-body-learning-dance) Gregg Mozgala, a 31-year-old actor with cerebral palsy, had 12 years of physical therapy while he was growing up.

But in the last eight months, a determined choreographer with an unconventional rsum has done what all those therapists could not: She has dramatically changed the way Mr. Mozgala walks. In the process, she has changed his view of himself and of his possibilities. Mr. Mozgala and the choreographer, Tamar Rogoff, have been working since last winter on a dance piece called Diagnosis of a Faun. It is to have its premiere on Dec. 3 at La MaMa Annex in the East Village, but the more important work of art may be what Ms. Rogoff has done to transform Mr. Mozgalas body. **I have felt things that I felt were completely closed off to me for the last 30 years, he said. The amount of sensation that comes through the work has been totally unexpected and is really quite wonderful.** Ms. Rogoff has often worked outside normal dance parameters with prison inmates, for instance and knew immediately that she wanted to try to create a piece for Mr. Mozgala. I didnt know what I was going to do for him, she said, but I just knew he was inspiring to me. She introduced Mr. Mozgala to a tension-releasing shaking technique, and it was immediately revelatory. My body just really took to it, Mr. Mozgala said. I did that for about 20 or 30 minutes, and when I stood up, I was walking completely differently. My feet were flat on the ground. They knew they were onto something. **Note:** Explore more positive stories like this in our comprehensive [inspiring news articles archive](https://www.wanttoknow.info/inspirationalnewsarticles) focused on solutions and bridging divides. **Revolutionary Music Therapy Helps Paralyzed Man Walk and Talk Again - It 'Unlocked the Brain'** **April 30, 2023, *Good News Network*** [read on WantToKnow.info](https://www.wanttoknow.info/a-revolutionary-music-therapy-helps-paralyzed-man-walk-talk-again--it-unlocked-brain) A patient who was left almost completely paralyzed from a rare disease is now walking and talking again, after a music therapist prescribed mindful listening to his favorite song every night-in this case, a tune by The Carpenters. 71 year-old Ian Palmer was struck down with Guillain-Barr© syndrome last June, forcing him to spend seven months in a hospital where he was unable to walk or speak properly.

[A [2021 study](https://content.iospress.com/articles/journal-of-alzheimers-disease/jad210610)] set out to see what happens in the brain when a person with mild cognitive impairment or early Alzheimer's disease listens to their favorite playlist for an hour every day. The 14 participants had brain scans and took neuropsychological tests that involved memory exercises. At the end of the trial the participants showed a small but statistically significant improvement in memory - something that is extremely unusual. **New connections had formed between different regions of the brain ... that actually changed brain plasticity and also improved function in relaying information. **Thaut says the research shows that while music is in no way a cure for Alzheimers, it can provide a \"cognitive boost.\" That's why a person with memory impairment may not recall their daughter's name but may remember all the lyrics to her favorite lullaby. \"It's pulling from emotions, it's pulling from feelings, it's pulling from interpersonal associations, it's pulling from a date or time or period of one's life - historical things,\" [Concetta] Tomaino says.

Scientific research has shown that music helps [fight depression](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5500733/), [lower blood pressure](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15296685) and [reduce pain](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16722953). The National Institutes of Health has a partnership with the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts called [Sound Health: Music and the Mind](https://cms.kennedy-center.org/series/sound-health-home/sound-health), to expand on the links between music and mental health. It explores how listening to, performing or creating music involves brain circuitry that can be harnessed to improve health and well-being. Dr. Francis Collins, director of the National Institutes of Health, said: Were bringing neuroscientists together with musicians to speak each others language. Mental health conditions are among those areas wed like to see studied. Mr. Braunstein, 63, has experienced the benefits of music for his own mental health and set out to bring them to others. **Mr. Braunstein reached out to [Caroline Whiddon] about creating an orchestra that welcomed musicians with mental illnesses and family members and friends who support them. Mr. Braunstein called his new venture the Me2/Orchestra**, because when he told other musicians about his mental health diagnosis, theyd often respond, Me too. In 2014, a second orchestra, Me2/Boston, was created. At each performance, a few musicians briefly talk about their mental illnesses and take questions from the audience. **Note:** Explore more positive stories like this in our comprehensive [inspiring news articles archive](https://www.wanttoknow.info/inspirationalnewsarticles) focused on solutions and bridging divides.. **Do Art Lovers Live Longer?** **December 23, 2019, *Psychology Today*** [read on WantToKnow.info](https://www.wanttoknow.info/a-do-art-lovers-live-longer) People who engage in arts-related cultural activities such as going to museums or musical concerts may have a lower risk of dying prematurely, according to a new study by researchers from University College London (UCL).

The UCL researchers found a substantial reduction in early mortality among older adults who engaged in cultural activities. **After a variety of confounding factors (e.g., socioeconomics, occupational status) were taken into account, those who participated in cultural activities \"every few months or more\" had a 31 percent lower risk of premature death**. This \"arts engagement and mortality\" analysis spanned 14 years and involved nearly 7,000 older adults. Study participants self-reported the frequency of their arts engagement and cultural activities such as going to museums, art galleries, concerts, and the theater. Daisy Fancourt and Andrew Steptoe co-authored this paper. Part of the link between longevity and arts engagement is attributable to the socioeconomic advantages of those who have the leisure time and financial resources to engage in cultural activities regularly. That said, Fancourt and Steptoe report that arts engagement may have a protective association with longevity that transcends socioeconomics or occupational status. According to the authors, \"This association might be partly explained by differences in cognition, mental health, and physical activity among those who do and do not engage in the arts, but remains even when the model is adjusted for these factors.\" **Note:** See the BMJ study on [this webpage](https://www.bmj.com/content/367/bmj.l6377).

Singing. Its song is ethereal and mystifying and very, very weird a rather astonishing, newly discovered phenomen[on] that's not easily analyzed, but which, if you really let it sink into your consciousness, can change the way you look at everything. Scientists now say the planet itself is generating a constant, deep thrum of noise. No mere cacophony, but actually a kind of music huge, swirling loops of sound, a song so ... low it can't be heard by human ears, [roars] churning from the very water and wind and rock themselves, countless notes of varying vibration creating all sorts of curious tonal phrases that bounce around the mountains and spin over the oceans and penetrate the tectonic plates and gurgle in the magma and careen off the clouds and smack into trees and bounce off your ribcage and spin over the surface of the planet in strange circular loops.

Sure, sensitive instruments are getting better at picking up what's been dubbed \"Earth's hum,\" but** no one's any closer to understanding what ... it all might mean.

May we all find inspiration both within and outside of ourselves every day to be the very best we can be.* **Strongest Dad in the World** Rick Reilly for *Sports Illustrated* I try to be a good father. Give my kids mulligans. Work nights to pay for their text messaging. Take them to swimsuit shoots. But compared with Dick Hoyt, I suck. Eighty-five times he's pushed his disabled son, Rick, 26.2 miles in marathons. Eight times he's not only pushed him 26.2 miles in a wheelchair but also towed him 2.4 miles in a dinghy while swimming and pedaled him 112 miles in a seat on the handlebars - all in the same day. Dick's also pulled him cross-country skiing, taken him on his back mountain climbing and once hauled him across the U.S. on a bike. Makes taking your son bowling look a little lame, right? And what has Rick done for his father? Not much - except save his life. This love story began in Winchester, Mass., 43 years ago, when Rick was strangled by the umbilical cord during birth, leaving him brain-damaged and unable to control his limbs. \"He'll be a vegetable the rest of his life,\" Dick says doctors told him and his wife, Judy, when Rick was nine months old. \"Put him in an institution.\" But the Hoyts weren't buying it. They noticed the way Rick's eyes followed them around the room. When Rick was 11 they took him to the engineering department at Tufts University and asked if there was anything to help the boy communicate. \"No way,\" Dick says he was told. \"There's nothing going on in his brain.\" \"Tell him a joke,\" Dick countered. They did. Rick laughed. Turns out a lot was going on in his brain. Rigged up with a computer that allowed him to control the cursor by touching a switch with the side of his head, Rick was finally able to communicate. First words? \"Go Bruins!\" And after a high school classmate was paralyzed in an accident and the school organized a charity run for him, Rick pecked out, \"Dad, I want to do that.\" Yeah, right. How was Dick, a self-described \"porker\" who never ran more than a mile at a time, going to push his son five miles? Still, he tried. \"Then it was me who was handicapped,\" Dick says. \"I was sore for two weeks.\" That day changed Rick's life. \"Dad,\" he typed, \"when we were running, it felt like I wasn't disabled anymore!\" And that sentence changed Dick's", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:inspiration__hoyt_team_rick_dick.txt:0:a467483a4e5d", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 11836, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "inspiration__hoyt_team_rick_dick.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "inspiration__hoyt_team_rick_dick", "chunk_index": 1, "text": "charity run for him, Rick pecked out, \"Dad, I want to do that.\" Yeah, right.

He became obsessed with giving Rick that feeling as often as he could. He got into such hard-belly shape that he and Rick were ready to try the 1979 Boston Marathon. \"No way,\" Dick was told by a race official. The Hoyts weren't quite a single runner, and they weren't quite a wheelchair competitor. For a few years Dick and Rick just joined the massive field and ran anyway. Then they found a way to get into the race officially: In 1983 they ran another marathon so fast they made the qualifying time for Boston the following year. Then somebody said, \"Hey, Dick, why not a triathlon?\" How's a guy who never learned to swim and hadn't ridden a bike since he was six going to haul his 110-pound kid through a triathlon? Still, Dick tried. Now they've done 212 triathlons, including four grueling 15-hour Ironmans in Hawaii. It must be a buzzkill to be a 25-year-old stud getting passed by an old guy towing a grown man in a dinghy, don't you think? Hey, Dick, why not see how you'd do on your own? \"No way,\" he says. Dick does it purely for \"the awesome feeling\" he gets seeing Rick with a cantaloupe smile as they run, swim and ride together. This year, at ages 65 and 43, Dick and Rick finished their 24th Boston Marathon, in 5,083rd place out of more than 20,000 starters. Their best time? Two hours, 40 minutes in 1992 - only 35 minutes off the world record, which, in case you don't keep track of these things, happens to be held by a guy who was not pushing another man in a wheelchair at the time. \"No question about it,\" Rick types. \"My dad is the Father of the Century.\" And Dick got something else out of all this too. Two years ago he had a mild heart attack during a race. Doctors found that one of his arteries was 95% clogged. \"If you hadn't been in such great shape,\" one doctor told him, \"you probably would've died 15 years ago.\" So, in a way, Dick and Rick saved each other's life.

If you follow the news on TV, online, and in social media, you may have developed the impression that we live in a terrible shadow world filled with disease, hatred, racism, violence, war, and corruption almost everywhere. Yet **what is hugely underreported is the great number of individuals and groups coming together to shine their light and transform our lives and world in a major way.** It's all a matter of what we choose to focus on. By consciously balancing the shadow and light in our lives, we can be more effective in building a brighter future for all of us. Remember that the media makes its profits through pandering to our obsession with fear and sensationalism. Yet we always have choice in how much we pay attention to the fear-mongering, and to what we do with it. Once we both individually and collectively transform our obsession with fear and sensationalism, watch how the world transforms around us in miraculous ways. Whether you are feeling hopeless or see the infinite possibilities available to us, you must watch the incredibly inspiring six-minute video of Paul Hawken below. **In this beautiful presentation, Hawken lays out clearly how, even though the media barely mentions it, the greatest movement on Earth is happening all around us, and it's growing like wildfire.** [**https://www.personalgrowthcourses.net/video/blessed_unrest_hawken**](https://www.personalgrowthcourses.net/video/blessed_unrest_hawken) Literally hundreds of thousands of groups representing many millions of people around the world are working together for a better world for all of us.

We think it is hate, but it is fear.* - Mahatma Gandhi Drones, snipers, razor wire, panic buttons, sniffer dogs, body armor, bulletproof glass. These are some of the [security measures](https://www.wired.com/story/2024-us-election-polling-location-militarized-security/) American election officials are implementing for Tuesday's vote. Fear is useful for avoiding danger, yet it is too often used to hijack our thinking and obscure the bigger picture. The militarization of our elections, [driven by official warnings about right-wing extremists](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/oct/31/election-political-violence-surge), shows just how deeply fear has infected society. What we need is a more complete and nuanced understanding of the political forces shaping American society. More than that, we need narratives that turn our attention to what might bring us together-regardless of our political differences and who gets elected in office. While far-right extremism is undoubtedly a reality, political violence is actually very rare-representing [just over 1% of violent hate crimes](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2116870119) in the United States. In a [recent poll](https://www.vice.com/en/article/republican-voters-white-supremacy/), the majority of Republicans identified white supremacist extremism as a \"problem,\" yet mainstream media continues to [portray Republicans](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/06/27/opinion/republicans-extreme-abortion.html) in general as extremists. A groundbreaking [2022 study](https://perceptiongap.us/) by More in Common revealed that Americans significantly overestimated the extremity of the beliefs held by those with differing viewpoints, with Democrats and Republicans each \"overestimating the proportion of their political opponents holding immoderate views by about 20 percentage points or more.\" Contrary to fearful mainstream media narratives, these are a few of many examples that show [we're not as divided and polarized as we are led to believe](https://peerservice.substack.com/p/how-elections-and-both-political). \"We call this the \"perception gap\" in American politics,\" [the More in Common study says](https://www.cnn.com/2019/11/14/opinions/perception-gap-republican-democrat-yudkin/index.html), \"the yawning chasm between Americans' suspicions and reality.\" The reality may be more complex than we think, and the threat of political violence may be overblown. Going deeper, who's really behind the rise of far-right extremism? We're all familiar with the MAGA effect, but could there be deeper forces at work? Can we exclusively fear far-right political violence without acknowledging the historic role that the American empire has played in fueling right-wing extremism? Below, we take a look at the systems of power that have long manipulated and fueled the very extremism we're now being told to fear. Through [Operation Paperclip](https://www.wanttoknow.info/military-intelligence-corruption-information#paperclip), the CIA, NASA, and many other branches of government provided aliases for top Nazi officers and scientists to enter and be employed by the US after World War II. More than 1,500 Nazis were secretly embedded in the US scientific community and intelligence establishment.

A report from the Global Project Against Hate and Extremism [recently warned](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/oct/31/election-political-violence-surge) that ignoring the threat of post-election, far-right political violence in the US will only exacerbate election denialism and anti-democratic sentiment. Yet it's crucial to recognize that the issue of election integrity is not a partisan issue. In the US, [election corruption happens on both sides of the political aisle](https://peerservice.substack.com/p/how-elections-and-both-political). Internationally, the US government-[under the leadership of both political parties](https://www.wanttoknow.info/a-honduras-15-years-after-coup-interview-with-ousted-president-manuel-zelaya)-has manipulated elections and governments all over the world. This manipulation has [installed and propped up right-wing regimes](https://www.salon.com/2014/03/08/35_countries_the_u_s_has_backed_international_crime_partner/), supporting fascists, drug lords, and terrorists. And let's not forget [US support for neo-Nazis in Ukraine](https://therealnews.com/the-us-is-arming-and-assisting-neo-nazis-in-ukraine-while-congress-debates-prohibition). Throughout the global war on drugs, [American ties to right-wing extremism was on full display](https://peerservice.substack.com/p/the-dark-truths-behind-the-us-war). It was also discovered that the Democratic Party fueled the very extremism they claim to oppose by [financing the most prominent figures in election denial](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/09/12/democrats-interfere-republican-primaries/) to the tune of [tens of millions of dollars](https://www.opensecrets.org/news/2022/07/democrats-spend-millions-on-republican-primaries/) during the 2022 Republican primaries. [Democrats in nine states](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/interactive/2022/democrat-ad-spending-republican-trump) worked to amplify more extreme Republican candidates, believing they would be easier to defeat in the general election compared to Trump. This approach ultimately increased the reach of the most extreme voices and further radicalized the electorate. **FBI Involvement in Terrorism** *The gigantic catastrophes that threaten us today are not elemental happenings of a physical or biological order, but psychic events. To a quite terrifying degree we are threatened by wars and revolutions which are nothing other than psychic epidemics. At any moment several million human beings may be smitten with a new madness, and then we shall have another world war or devastating revolution. Instead of being at the mercy of wild beasts, earthquakes, landslides, and inundations, modern man is battered by the elemental forces of his own psyche.* - Carl Jung The [Oklahoma City bombing](https://www.okhistory.org/publications/enc/entry?entry=OK026) in the 90s was one of the most impactful terrorist attacks on US soil. The attack was carried out by far-right extremists with suspicious ties to the FBI, as evidenced by a sworn declaration from Terry Lynn Nichols, the only surviving convict in the case. Nichols claimed that his co-conspirator, Timothy McVeigh, [revealed](https://www.wanttoknow.info/a-nichols-says-bombing-was-fbi-op) he was taking orders from a high-ranking FBI official, [raising serious questions](https://www.wanttoknow.info/a--conspiracy-so-vast-how-crimes-become-obsessions) about the extent of government involvement in the bombing plot.

But it was barely reported that the leader of the Proud Boys, [Enrique Tarrio was an FBI informant](https://www.wanttoknow.info/a-proud-boys-leader-was-prolific-informant-the-fbi-report-says). In fact, the FBI had as many as [eight informants](https://www.yahoo.com/news/fbi-reportedly-had-eight-informants-153404947.html) within the Proud Boys during the Capitol storming. Yet as *New York Times* [reported](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/03/01/us/politics/proud-boys-jan-6-trial-bertino.html), \"despite the vast amount of evidence the government collected in the case - including more than 500,000 encrypted text messages - investigators never found a smoking gun that conclusively showed the Proud Boys plotted to help President Donald J. Trump remain in office.\" *The vast majority of those caught up in the incursion of the Capitol did not commit serious crimes, engage in violence or know what they would do in Washington other than protest the election results. We are exacerbating the growing tribalism and political antagonisms that will increasingly express themselves through violence. We are complicit, once again, of using the courts to carry out vendettas. We are corroding democratic institutions. We are hardening the ideology and rage of the far-right.* - Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist Chris Hedges Chris Hedges, [Lynching the Deplorables](https://chrishedges.substack.com/p/lynching-the-deplorables) While the Oklahoma City bombing led to far greater loss of life than the events on January 6, both incidents share a troubling similarity: the involvement of the FBI with the perpetrators. After all, the FBI has had a [notorious history](https://www.wanttoknow.info/a-government-agents-directly-involved-most-highprofile-us-terror-plots) of [manufacturing terrorist plots](https://www.wanttoknow.info/a-why-does-fbi-have-manufacture-its-own-plots-if-terrorism-isis-such-grave-threats), often [targeting vulnerable minors](https://www.wanttoknow.info/a-predator-or-prey-undercover-federal-agents-target-vulnerable-teens) who have significant cognitive and intellectual disabilities yet no history of harming anyone. Prosecuting innocent teenagers like this not only pads the FBI's arrest and prosecution statistics but also helps justify its budget by misrepresenting the threat of terrorism. National security expert Sahar Aziz reflects on the nature of the FBI's tactics, saying, \"If there were genuine terrorist threats in America, the FBI wouldn't be diverting its resources to ensnaring a mentally ill minor.\" **A Call to Rise Above Fear and Polarization-Regardless of Who's Elected** *I want there to be a place in the world where people can engage in one another's differences in a way that is redemptive, full of hope and possibility. **Without an ethic of love shaping the direction of our political vision and our radical aspirations, we are often seduced, in one way or the other, into continued allegiance to systems of domination.** The ability to acknowledge blind", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:inspiration__insights-from-ndes copy.txt:2:14da083dd000", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 11847, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "inspiration__insights-from-ndes copy.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "inspiration__insights-from-ndes copy", "chunk_index": 3, "text": "ill minor.\" **A Call to Rise Above Fear and Polarization-Regardless of Who's Elected** *I want there to be a place in the world where people can engage in one another's differences in a way that is redemptive, full of hope and possibility. **Without an ethic of love shaping the direction of our political vision and our radical aspirations, we are often seduced, in one way or the other, into continued allegiance to systems of domination.** The ability to acknowledge blind spots can emerge only as we expand our capacity to care about the oppression and exploitation of others. A love ethic makes this expansion possible.* - poet and social justice activist bell hooks Far-right, white supremacist extremism is a legitimate threat, and we need to find ways to heal the cycle of violence and hate in our communities. For example, Black musician Daryl Davis [befriended hundreds of KKK and white supremacists with love and acceptance](https://www.wanttoknow.info/a-im-black-musician-who-has-befriended-encouraged-over-200-ku-klux-klan-members-give-up-their-robes), leading these individuals to disavow their allegiances and thus unravel generations of hate. The work of Smith college professor Loretta Ross provides a [constructive alternative to the dehumanizing cancel culture](https://www.wanttoknow.info/a-what-if-instead-calling-people-out-we-called-them-) that has become widespread in our society. As a social justice activist, she lived through [COINTELPRO](https://www.wanttoknow.info/ia/cointelpro-fbi), a secret FBI program that sought to destroy lives, ruin reputations, and disrupt socially progressive organizations that challenged establishment interests. Over the years, she's built unexpected yet transformative relationships with KKK members and incarcerated men convicted of serious crimes against women. In response to the growing polarization in our society, she once said \"if you're more wedded to destabilizing than unifying, part of me is gonna think you're naive, and the other part of me is gonna think you're a plant. And neither one of those is going to look good on you.\" She lives by a motto that was shared with her by her mentor Reverend C. T. Vivian: **\"When you ask people to give up hate, you have to be there for them when they do.\"** Perhaps a greater threat to society is the misrepresentation of extremism to make people afraid and easier to manipulate. Who benefits from creating mass fear in the public about right-wing extremism? Politicians and government agencies consolidating their power, the national security and surveillance state profitably expanding its reach, and corporate media capitalizing on strong emotions. After all, the fear of Communism benefitted Adolf Hitler, and [made people more willing](https://www.yesmagazine.org/issue/science/2017/02/16/how-norway-avoided-becoming-a-fascist-state) to conform to harsh militant rule and turn a blind eye to genocide.

In fact, a [recent poll](https://www.axios.com/2023/04/17/poll-americans-independent-republican-democrat) revealed that a record 49% of Americans see themselves as politically independent - the same percentage as the two major parties put together. Regardless of who's elected in office, society's greatest problems will remain, far outweighing the threat of far-right terrorism. If we really wanted to protect the American people, we could save millions of lives by dismantling the [corporate cartels controlling our food and healthcare systems](https://peerservice.substack.com/p/historic-senate-panel-exposes-how). We could also hold our intelligence agencies accountable for their longstanding history of funding and supporting repressive terrorist regimes all over the world. Perhaps most importantly, we could begin addressing the corporate practices and government policies responsible for the extreme levels of financial inequality holding our entire society back. No matter who we vote for, each of us has the responsibility to work with our fears in the face of complex issues that lack clear answers. Destabilization, chaos, and polarization may provoke deeper questions that could help us turn to one another-across our echo chambers and political differences.

I used to see death as a dark void, a nothingness that swallowed everything. This fear would sometimes cause sleep paralysis and intense anxiety throughout the day. Yet now, my fears are changing. My journey with PEERS and [WantToKnow.info](https://www.wanttoknow.info/) has opened my eyes to something bigger-even beyond the politics and problems we help bring to light. The fascinating stories we've collected in our [Inspiration Center](https://www.wanttoknow.info/inspirational) about what happens when people face death profoundly expanded my worldview and began to transform my thinking. Instead of letting the fear of death paralyze me, I'm learning to meet it with compassion, curiosity, and wonder. My personal journey mirrors the larger struggle we face as a society. Fear of the unknown, the unfamiliar, and death shape most of our lives. According to neuroscientist Rick Hanson, the misuse of fear comes from two mistakes in perception: *overestimating threats* and *underestimating resources and possibilities*. Mythologist and scholar of anthropology Michael Meade once [observed](https://www.wanttoknow.info/g/hidden-purpose-of-fear) that too much fear can lead to unnecessary panic as well as a **paralysis of imagination.** What life practices and conscious behavior choices empower us to cultivate courage and creative responses to fear? *At critical junctures, outer trouble and the inner need to grow conspire to set each of us on a path of awakening and initiation.* ― Michael Meade In a world facing significant challenges, our current stories about the world are falling short. **Who are we? Why are we here? What are we truly capable of? **These questions are at the heart of a collective shift in consciousness. **Nothing shows this more clearly than the incredible phenomena of near-death experiences (NDEs).** **The incredible phenomena of near-death experiences (NDEs)** [Near-death experiences](https://www.wanttoknow.info/nde/near-death-experiences-ndes) (NDEs) happen when people come close to death or are even declared clinically dead, yet return to life. During these moments, many have vivid and life-changing experiences. Something greater than their ego, personality, and physical body takes over. Common experiences include the entering of different realms or dimensions, time distortion, images of life events, telepathic communication with spiritual beings or deceased family members and ancestors, and many other fascinating experiences that defy our conventional understanding of reality. Researchers [report](https://www.wanttoknow.info/a-outofbody-experiences-can-lead-profound-lasting-psychological-transformations-new-research-reports) that 55% of individuals who had an out-of-body experience reported that the experience profoundly changed their lives, and 71% described it as providing lasting benefit. *If there is consciousness without brain activity, then consciousness must dwell somewhere beyond the brain.

Doctors predicted that she would never wake up again. Yet little did they know, her journey into deeper dimensions was just beginning. Before leaving her body, Moorjani vividly recalled seeing her husband and overhearing doctors discuss her impending death. *Hovering between life and death, she said she was surrounded by people who loved her. Her [deceased] best friend, Soni, was there. So was her father, who had died years earlier from heart failure. There were others there, too. She knew they loved her and cared for her. It was a feeling unlike anything she says she had ever felt. \"At first, I did not want to come back. Why would I want to come back into this sick body?\" she said. About 30 hours after being hospitalized, Moorjani awoke. Within days, she said, her organs began to function again. **Within weeks, doctors could find no evidence of cancer in her body.*** - \"[Stories of life, death and faith: 'To Heaven and Back'](https://edition.cnn.com/2013/11/29/us/to-heaven-and-back),\" CNN A [recent study](https://nyulangone.org/news/lucid-dying-patients-recall-death-experiences-during-cpr) reveals that one in five people who survive CPR after cardiac arrest recall vivid experiences of death, even though they appeared unconscious and close to dying. In a [study](https://www.wanttoknow.info/a-near-death-experiences-heaven-wait) of 710 kidney dialysis patients, researchers discovered that out of 70 who faced life-threatening events, 45 reported having near-death experiences. Researchers now believe [one in 20](https://www.nbcwashington.com/news/health/near-death-experiences-heres-what-researchers-have-found/3464461/) people will have a near-death experience. *This is why NDEs are so fascinating and perfect for the current moment.

His supervising resident had left to take a nap, and he was left alone when a patient in cardiac arrest was brought in. From the early morning until the afternoon, he continued to shock the man's heart while delivering grim updates to the patient's wife. When the patient's lunch showed up, he ended up eating his lunch himself. After a long day, the patient eventually stabilized and spent 30 days recovering in the hospital. When the patient was ready to go home, he asked to speak with Tom about what happened when he died. He recounted floating above the room and watching Tom struggle to save his life. He noted the moments when Tom spoke to his wife in ways that weren't very positive, and that \"if that wasn't bad enough, you ate my lunch.\" Yet what got Aufderheide's attention the most was when the patient said, **\"The one thing that I wanted to tell you was that here I was dying in front of you and you were standing there feeling sorry for yourself because your senior resident didn't back you up and left you alone.\" Aufderheide couldn't understand how he was able to read his mind!** The patient went on to describe a beautiful life review, reuniting with loved ones who had passed, and speaking with a being of light that ultimately told him he needed to return to life. *The only courage that is demanded of us: to have courage for the most strange, the most singular, and the most inexplicable that we may encounter.\"* - Rainer Maria Rilke, Austrian poet and novelist [Dannion Brinkley](https://www.8newsnow.com/investigators/dannionbrinkley/) was a successful businessman and US Marine, who was recruited into an elite squad assigned to assassinate enemy politicians and military leaders. Yet everything changed when a bolt of lightning struck a telephone pole, traveled down the phone line, and slammed into his body-melting the phone he was holding.

Brinkley left his body, floated along with the ambulance as it raced to a hospital, and watched from above as doctors declared him dead. Less than an hour later, he awoke in the hospital morgue. During that time, Brinkley left his body and entered a realm of unconditional love. He encountered a being of light that radiated pure compassion and a powerful presence he had never experienced. He was shown a grueling replay of his entire life, where he witnessed the pain he caused on everyone impacted by his actions-including the lives shattered by his deadly actions as a US Marine. More beings of light showed him visions of war and collective suffering in the future. In his New York Times bestselling book, *[Saved by the Light](https://www.amazon.com/Saved-Light-Profound-Revelations-Received/dp/0061662453)*, Brinkley revealed a profound message he received from one of the beings: *\"The flow of human events can be changed, but first people have to know what they are,\" said the Being. He communicated to me again their belief that humans were great, powerful, and mighty spiritual Beings. He then told me my purpose on earth. \"You are there to create spiritualistic capitalism,\" he said. \"You are to engage this coming system by changing people's thought processes. Show people how to rely on their spiritual selves instead of the government and churches. Religion is fine, but don't let people be entirely controlled by it. \"Humans are mighty spiritual beings. All they need to realize is that love is treating others the way they themselves want to be treated.\" **Then the Being let me know what I was supposed to do back on earth. I was to create centers where people could come to reduce stress in their lives. Through this reduction of stress, said the Being, humans would come to realize, \"as we do,\" that they are higher spiritual beings. They would become less fearful and more loving of their fellow man.*** When he returned back into his body, Dannion faced unspeakable pain and suffering.

Key to ending fear, he believes, is training people to help make the transition to death a loving, gentle, and normal experience.*** - Dannion Brinkley Psychology professor Dr. Kenneth Ring [engaged](https://www.wanttoknow.info/a-kenneth-ring-you-never-recover-your-original-self) with hundreds of people of all ages who came close to physical death. Strikingly, those who had a near-death experience almost totally lost their fear of death. In an interview with *[The New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/1988/08/28/nyregion/connecticut-q-a-kenneth-ring-you-never-recover-your-original-self.html)*, Ring reflected, \"Death vanishes for them. There's only life. They are so aware of what life is. **One man said, 'I finally knew what it was like to be really alive.'' They're profoundly appreciative of being alive. They've got a greater sense of self-worth and care more deeply for others and are able to give love more freely.\"** Neurosurgeon [Dr. Eben Alexander](https://www.newsweek.com/proof-heaven-doctors-experience-afterlife-65327) was skeptical about near-death experiences until he fell into a deep coma for seven days due to a rare bacterial meningitis caused by E. coli, which had invaded his cerebrospinal fluid and was damaging his brain. During this time, he journeyed into a \"brain-free consciousness.\" He realized that \"death is not the end of consciousness but rather a chapter in a vast, and incalculably positive, journey.\" A female being was with him, who spoke to him without words. He reflects: \"The message had three parts, and if I had to translate them into earthly language, I'd say they ran something like this: **You are loved and cherished, dearly, forever. You have nothing to fear. There is nothing you can do wrong.**\" The famous Swiss psychologist Carl Jung had his own [extraordinary experience](https://cominghomechannel.substack.com/p/revisiting-carl-jungs-near-death). At age 70, he slipped on ice and broke his foot. During his hospital stay, a heart attack left him unresponsive for days. What followed was a profound near-death experience, years before the concept was widely recognized. Jung described his phenomenal experiences in his memoir, *[Memories, Dreams, Reflections](https://www.amazon.com/Memories-Dreams-Reflections-C-Jung/dp/0679723951)*: *It seemed to me that I was high up in space.

My field of vision did not include the whole Earth, but its global shape was plainly distinguishable, and its outlines shone with a silvery gleam through that wonderful blue light. I knew that I was on the point of departing from the earth . . . Later I discovered how high in space one would have to be to have so extensive a view-approximately a thousand miles! The sight of the Earth from this height was the most glorious thing I had ever seen. Something new entered my field of vision. A short distance away I saw in space a tremendous dark block of stone, like a meteorite. It was floating in space, and I myself was floating in space . . . an entrance led into a small antechamber. To the right of the entrance, a black Hindu sat silently in lotus posture upon a stone bench. He wore a white gown, and I knew that he expected me. As I approached the steps leading up to the entrance into the rock, a strange thing happened: I had the feeling that everything was being sloughed away; everything I aimed at or wished for or thought, the whole phantasmagoria of earthly existence, fell away or was stripped from me-an extremely painful process. Nevertheless something remained; it was as if I now carried along with me everything I had ever experienced or done, everything that had happened around me. I might also say: it was with me, and I was it. I consisted of all that, so to speak. I am this bundle of what has been and what has been accomplished. This experience gave me a feeling of extreme poverty, but at the same time of great fullness. There was no longer anything I wanted or desired . . . I had everything that I was, and that was everything.* **Integrating the Wisdom of NDEs Into Our Everyday Lives** As traditional touchstones of meaning like faith, family, and friendship have fallen by the wayside in recent decades, people are increasingly [finding their meaning and identity in political issues](https://www.wanttoknow.info/a--disposition-the-heart-exploring-power-civility-heal-divides).

Quantum physicist and consciousness researcher Dr. Amit Goswami [observed](https://www.wanttoknow.info/a-what-quantum-physics-can-tell-us-about-nonviolence) that **if this same consciousness works through all of us, then we're all in a sense a part of the same larger being, and it is complete ignorance to be violent to each other.** Those who've had transformative near-death experiences are our teachers. They often return forever changed. Many have found a renewed faith in something higher that governs life, a restored sense of goodness in themselves and others, and a deeper understanding of what truly matters in life. I choose to embrace the unknown with an open heart. The possibilities about who we are and where we come from truly amaze me. **The fear of death that once cast a shadow over my life is now giving way to awe and wonder. Whatever might be happening in the world, we can seek meaning beyond our immediate fears and challenges. ** We need a larger story-one that connects us on a fundamental level. Soon, we'll be launching the **PEERS Awe and Wonder Library** video series, where we explore the depths of human consciousness, spirituality, the meaning of life, and the mysterious nature of reality.

Another poll found that [71% of people](https://www.cato.org/blog/poll-71-americans-say-political-correctness-has-silenced-discussions-society-needs-have-58) say political correctness has shut down important conversations, and [over half](https://www.cato.org/survey-reports/poll-62-americans-say-they-have-political-views-theyre-afraid-share#) are afraid to even share their political views with others. \"*The fact that we're increasingly socially isolated means also that we're not testing our ideas about the world with other people ... And the more you sit around the table with other people who might have somewhat different views, the more you start moderating your own views. And the increasing lack of social interaction and social isolation as a result, for a lot of people - amplified by echo chambers - makes people more radical.*\" -\"[Americans Are Unhappier Than Ever.

In today's media landscape, this ancient \"negativity bias\" is constantly triggered, flooding us with an endless barrage of character attacks and smears, existential worst-case scenarios, distorted fear-based narratives, and who's to blame. Despite all the gifts that technology has brought to our lives, this hyper-connected digital world we live in has left us more alone and afraid of each other. *In 2023, [US Surgeon General] Vivek Murthy ... published an 81-page warning about America's \"epidemic of loneliness,\" claiming that its negative health effects were on par with those of tobacco use and obesity. A growing number of public-health officials seem to regard loneliness as the developed world's next critical public-health issue. The United Kingdom now has a minister for loneliness. So does Japan.* Richard V. Reeves, the president of the [American Institute for Boys and Men](https://aibm.org/), told me that for men, as for women, something hard to define is lost when we pursue a life of isolationist comforts. He calls it \"neededness\"-the way we make ourselves essential to our families and community. \"I think at some level, **we all need to feel like we're a jigsaw piece that's going to fit into a jigsaw somewhere.\"** Today's young men do not seem to be constructing these relationships in the same way that they used to. In place of neededness, despair is creeping in. **Feeling unneeded \"is actually, in some cases, literally fatal,\" Reeves said. \"If you look at the words that men use to describe themselves before they take their own lives, they are worthless and useless.\"** Since 2001, hundreds of thousands of men have died of drug overdoses. These drugs, he emphasized, are defined by their solitary nature: Opioids are not party drugs, but rather the opposite. -\"[The Anti-Social Century](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2025/02/american-loneliness-personality-politics/681091/),\" *The Atlantic* Cognitive scientist and psychologist Dr. John Vervaeke calls this the Meaning Crisis, the pervasive feeling of alienation and disconnection from the world and from each other. In an [interview](https://www.resilience.org/stories/2025-01-09/john-vervaeke-the-meaning-crisis-wisdom-purpose-and-the-search-for-coherence/) with Resilience, John Vervaeke cites a [UK survey](https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/9637619/young-brits-life-lacks-purpose/) revealing a tragic finding: 89% of 16- to 29-year-olds in the UK say their life lacks meaning.

Vervaeke explains that a lack of meaning in life occurs when people become stuck in a rut, paralyzed by suboptimal assessments of the world such that they no longer feel like they fit into it well. Yet something powerful is stirring beneath the noise. Across ideological lines and in everyday life, people all over the world are cultivating abundance, security, and safety in relationship and community with one another. This matters now more than ever, because the future is not guaranteed to be stable. We're facing converging crises-rising national debt, failing institutions, ecological collapse, the chronic disease epidemic, authoritarianism on both sides of the political aisle, and a growing sense that business as usual cannot hold. The more united and grounded we are in real relationship, the harder it becomes for the powers that be to manipulate us, polarize us, or pit us against one another. Even in this uncertainty, the longing remains: to be part of something real. To create something more human than the systems unraveling around us. So the question becomes: **How do we find our way back to the kind of democracy that lives not just in institutions, but in how we treat one another? And how do we create the cultural and social conditions that bring out the best in each other?** As Dr. Andreas Heisler said, \"**The currency of the future will be relationships of trust.\"** Trust isn't built through political ideologies or some fixed set of \"agreed-upon facts.\" In today's world, even deciding what's true has become a battleground. On the other hand, trust grows from something deeper: the values and practices that bind us in relationship-mutual care, shared responsibility, and the belief that we're better off when we look out for one another. These are democratic values in the truest sense, rooted not in partisanship, but in the everyday ways we help each other survive, heal, and thrive. *When one lives in a society where people can no longer rely on the institutions to tell them the truth, the truth must come from culture and art.* -John Trudell, Native American poet, activist, and musician Below are some of the most moving examples of human connection, community resilience, and gift economy solutions-each one a powerful, grounded alternative to the loneliness and economic instability we face. In a time when centralized systems are faltering, these stories remind us where real security and strength come from: showing up for one another, sharing our gifts and skills with each other, and rebuilding the commons.

Perhaps this diminished collective creativity is our ultimate crisis: a **crisis of imagination**. This crisis seems to be driven, in part, by today's media and journalistic practices shaping public opinion about key issues. **Most news is about what we fear.** The recurrence of human failures, war, terror, tragedy, and who's to blame contribute to a cycle of cynicism and disengagement. When society is polarized, we lose touch with what brings out the best in humanity: collaboration, creativity, openness to nuance and complexity, social-emotional intelligence, and shared purpose. Where's the empowering news that highlights these qualities? **In a world gone awry with bad news, we have become passive consumers instead of creative thinkers generating our own news, broadening our media diet, and taking collaborative action. ** When it comes to the news we consume, we suggest that there's one more question that belongs to the traditional questions of who, when, where, and how: *What's possible now?* Solutions to society's problems are often under-reported and reforms go unrealized. Every day, people all over the world are working to heal and transform the massive power imbalances and injustices evident throughout society.

For over 25 years, my physical disability threatened to define who I was and what others thought I could become. **I contracted meningococcal disease at 8 years of age. The infection overwhelmed my body's defenses, and I became a triple amputee**. The disease left me with just enough to survive and carry on: two full fingers of the left hand, the thumb and ring finger. The first few years were physically and emotionally grueling; I was in and out of the hospital for surgical procedures to make my lower limbs fit better into prosthetic legs. I couldn't walk for nearly three years. I grew so quickly, my prosthetic legs could not keep up. My father would give me piggyback rides from the car to our house. My mother, who became blind as a teen, learned how to help me dress and put on my prosthetic legs every morning for school. My younger brother, Tarring, would help bring things to me since my mobility was limited. And my older sister, Nellie, was and is my inspiration and role model. I have been extremely lucky to have a strong and resilient family. I was lucky to be in a place where I had great medical care and where I had a community of friends and schools that supported my recovery and believed in my ability to succeed despite my disability. But luck is only part of my success; it takes courage, determination, honesty and integrity to pursue your dreams. **Note:** Dr. Kellie Lim, author of this article received her medical training from the David Geffen School of Medicine at the University of California, Los Angeles.

You have to want that summit. Erik Weihenmayer, 33, wasn't just another yuppie trekker. **Blind since he was 13 ... he began attacking mountains in his early 20s.** For Erik ... excelling as an athlete was the result of accepting his disability rather than denying it.\" Climbing with Erik isn't that different from climbing with a sighted mountaineer. You wear a bell on your pack, and he follows the sound ... using his custom-made climbing poles to feel his way along the trail. His climbing partners shout out helpful descriptions: \"Death fall 2 ft. to your right!\" Almost 90% of Everest climbers fail to reach the summit. Many - at least 165 since 1953 - never come home at all. When Erik and the team began the final ascent from Camp 4 ... they had been on the mountain for two months ... getting used to the altitude and socking away enough equipment [before they made the final, successful] summit push. \"He was the heart and soul of our team,\" says Eric Alexander. **\"The guy's spirit won't let you quit.\" It could be called the most successful Everest expedition ever**, and not just because of Erik's participation. A record 19 climbers from the N.F.B. team summited, including the oldest man ever to climb Everest - 64-year-old Sherman Bull. Perhaps the point is really that there is no way to put what Erik has done in perspective because no one has ever done anything like it. It is a unique achievement, one that in the truest sense pushes the limits of what man is capable of. **Note:** Don't miss the entire inspiring blind to failure story at the link above.

This ... opened up a whole new way of looking at her.\" This is what Carly wants people to know about autism. \"It is hard to be autistic because no one understands me. People look at me and assume I am dumb because I can't talk or I act differently than them. I think people get scared with things that look or seem different than them.\" Carly had another message for people who don't understand autism. \"Autism is hard because you want to act one way, but you can't always do that. It's sad that sometimes people don't know that sometimes I can't stop myself and they get mad at me. If I could tell people one thing about autism it would be that I don't want to be this way. But I am, so don't be mad.

Ryan Weimer understands that concept better than most. When his oldest son, Keaton, was 3 years old, he told his dad he wanted to be a pirate for Halloween. **Instead of simply dressing him up, Weimer spent months building Keaton - who lives with muscular dystrophy - a pirate ship made of wood, tablecloth sails and specially-crafted cannons, all fitted to his wheelchair. Keaton was ecstatic - and his dad never forgot the feeling**. \"When you know that you have few memories to make with your kids, you want to make priceless ones,\" Weimer told NBC News, \"and epic ones.\" His second son, Bryce, also lives with muscular dystrophy. Over the years, their wheelchair costumes have gotten more elaborate and attracted more attention. And this year, the Weimer family project became a hugely successful non-profit, called [Magic Wheelchair](https://www.magicwheelchair.org/). Volunteers from around the country donated their time, talents and resources to create dream costumes for eight lucky children - six from Weimer's home state of Oregon and two from Georgia. \"When we have challenges and trials and hard times, those are the things that define us,\" Weimer said. \"It doesn't' matter your circumstances, you can still make beautiful things ... and it's great to see other people get behind that.\" **Note:** Don't miss this [very touching video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQXvSb-ZC7U) on Magic Wheelchairs. **The Story Of Frank 'Bopsy' Salazar, Make-A-Wish's First Wish Kid, Will Stay", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:inspiration__inspiring-disabled-people-news-articles.txt:3:c58aee9abeaa", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 11873, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "inspiration__inspiring-disabled-people-news-articles.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "inspiration__inspiring-disabled-people-news-articles", "chunk_index": 4, "text": "dream costumes for eight lucky children - six from Weimer's home state of Oregon and two from Georgia. \"When we have challenges and trials and hard times, those are the things that define us,\" Weimer said. \"It doesn't' matter your circumstances, you can still make beautiful things ... and it's great to see other people get behind that.\" **Note:** Don't miss this [very touching video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQXvSb-ZC7U) on Magic Wheelchairs. **The Story Of Frank 'Bopsy' Salazar, Make-A-Wish's First Wish Kid, Will Stay With You Forever** **2013-01-11, *Huffington Post*** [http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/11/01/bopsy-fireman-make-a-wish_n_4181841....](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/11/01/bopsy-fireman-make-a-wish_n_4181841.html) In 1978, 5-year-old Frank \"Bopsy\" Salazar was diagnosed with leukemia. A woman named Linda Pauling ... had lost her 7-year-old son, Chris, to leukemia that spring. But before Chris passed, the Arizona Department of Public Safety had fulfilled the little boy's dream of becoming a police officer. DPS officers Jim Eaves and Frank Shankwitz had met Chris with a patrol car and motorcycle and made him the only honorary Arizona Highway Patrol Officer in the department's history. The incredible effort inspired Pauling and Shankwitz to start the [Make-A-Wish Foundation](http://wish.org/about-us/our-story/how-it-started). \"[Pauling] told me that **instead of letting the kids just feel sorry for themselves, they wanted to grant wishes, to do something every kid would benefit from, to fulfill their dream while they're still a part of this world**,\" Trujillo said. Shankwitz took over from there, and he went to visit Bopsy to find out more about the boy's dreams. After learning that he'd be granted a wish, the 7-year-old mulled it over. \"I want to ride in a hot air balloon,\" he told Shankwitz. Then he thought about it some more. \"No, I want to go to Disneyland.\" He paused again. \"No, I want to be a fireman.\" But Shankwitz didn't make him pick. All of Bopsy's wishes would be granted. He got his balloon ride and his trip to Disneyland. Fireman Bob - whose real name is Bob Walp - did more than was asked of him to help the sick boy. \"We didn't want to just give him a tour,\" Walp [recalled]. \"We decided to give him a badge and a jacket. We let him use the hose. We took him in the truck.\" **Note:** For more on this inspiring story, see [this webpage](http://www.weboflove.org/boyslastwish). **Lessons from the 'World's Ugliest Woman': 'Stop Staring and Start Learning'** **2012-09-13, Yahoo!** [https://web.archive.org/web/20120926012350/http://shine.yahoo.com/beauty/less...](https://web.archive.org/web/20120926012350/http://shine.yahoo.com/beauty/lessons-worlds-ugliest-woman-stop-staring-start-learning-184400606.html) When she was in high school, Lizzie Velasquez was dubbed \"The World's Ugliest Woman\" in an 8-second-long YouTube video. Born with a medical condition so rare that just two other people in the world are thought to have it, Velasquez has no adipose tissue and cannot create muscle, store energy, or gain weight.

She's even reclaimed YouTube, video blogging about everything from bullying to hair-styling tips to staying positive. Of course, the horrible comments left on that old YouTube video stung. \"I'm human, and of course these things are going to hurt,\" she said.** \"Their judgments of me isn't who I am, and I'm not going to let these things define me.

I had been told so, had read that he was very able for someone his age and who had been blind and crippled since birth. Patrick's eyes are not functional; his body and legs are stunted. He is in a wheelchair. When we first shook hands, his fingers seemed entirely too thick to be nimble. So when he offered to play the piano for me and his father rolled his wheelchair up to the baby grand, I confess that I thought to myself, \"Well, this will be sweet. He has overcome so much. How nice that he can play piano.\" But then Patrick put his hands to the keyboard, and his fingers began to race across it -- the entire span of it, his fingers moving up and back and over and across the keys so quickly and intricately that my fully-functional eyesight couldn't keep up with them.

I was stunned. The music his hands drew from that piano was so lovely and lyrical and haunting, so rich and complex and beyond anything I had imagined he would play that there was nothing I could say. All I could do was listen. **\"God made me blind and didn't give me the ability to walk. I mean, big deal.\" Patrick said, smiling. \"He gave me the talent to play piano and trumpet and all that good stuff.\"** This is Patrick's philosophy in life, and he wants people to know it. \"I'm the kind of person that's always going to fight till I win,\" he said. Patrick also attends the University of Louisville and plays trumpet in the marching band. The band director suggested it, and Patrick and his father, Patrick John Hughes, who have faced tougher challenges together, decided \"Why not?\" \"Don't tell us we can't do something,\" Patrick's father added, with a chuckle. He looks at Patrick with a mixture of love and loyalty and admiration, something not always seen in the eyes of a father when he gazes at his son. \"I've told him before. He's my hero.\" **Note:** For amazingly inspiring video clips of this unusual young musician on both Oprah and ESPN, [click here](https://vimeo.com/62807706) and [here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qTiYA1WiY8). **Glenn Cunningham, 78, Premier Miler of 1930's** **1988-03-11, *New York Times*** [https://www.nytimes.com/1988/03/11/obituaries/glenn-cunningham-78-premier-mil...](https://www.nytimes.com/1988/03/11/obituaries/glenn-cunningham-78-premier-miler-of-1930-s.html) Glenn Cunningham, a former world-record holder in the mile run who in 1979 was named the greatest track performer in the history of Madison Square Garden, died yesterday. He was 78 years old. **That Mr. Cunningham could win 21 of 31 mile races on the indoor track at the Garden during his prime in the 1930's was impressive.

After being told there was a strong possibility he would never walk again, he spent seven months in bed, and then received daily massages from his mother, who kneaded his damaged muscles and sped his way to walking, and then running. In high school, he played baseball and football and boxed and wrestled. At 13, he entered his first high school mile race and won easily.

She also has autism. Julia has been a part of the \"Sesame Street\" family via its storybooks and was so popular that the decision was made to add the character to the TV series. \"I think the big discussion right at the start was, 'How do we do this? How do we talk about autism?,'\" one of the show's writers, Christine Ferraro, told \"60 Minutes\" correspondent Lesley Stahl. Over the almost five decades \"Sesame Street\" has been on the air, it has established a reputation for inclusion with its characters. Joan Ganz Cooney, one of the founders of the Children's Television Workshop which developed \"Sesame Street,\" said it has also not been afraid to deal with real life issues. Julia's debut episode will deal with what autism can look like. The brain disorder can make it difficult for people with autism to [communicate with and relate to others](http://www.cnn.com/2013/10/14/health/autism-fast-facts/). The character of Big Bird talked to Stahl about his first interaction with Julia in which she ignored him. \"I thought that maybe she didn't like me,\" he said. \"Yeah, but you know, we had to explain to Big Bird that Julia likes Big Bird,\" the Elmo character added. \"It's just that Julia has autism. So sometimes it takes her a little longer to do things.\" **Ferraro hopes that along with educating viewers about autism the new character will settle in as a part of the neighborhood. \"I would love her to be not Julia, the kid on Sesame Street who has autism,\" the writer said. \"I would like her to be just Julia**.\" **Note:** Explore a treasure trove of concise summaries of incredibly [inspiring news articles](http://www.wanttoknow.info/inspirationalnewsarticles) on other topics which will inspire you to make a difference. **How an Aussie Man With Cerebral Palsy Tackled the Kokoda Trail** **2016-09-25, SBS (Australia's Special Broadcasting Service)** [https://www.sbs.com.au/news/the-feed/how-an-aussie-man-with-cerebral-palsy-ta...](https://www.sbs.com.au/news/the-feed/how-an-aussie-man-with-cerebral-palsy-tackled-the-kokoda-trail) **Andrew Short lives with spastic cerebral palsy**, which", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:inspiration__inspiring-disabled-people-news-articles.txt:8:c75dd179c720", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 11878, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "inspiration__inspiring-disabled-people-news-articles.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "inspiration__inspiring-disabled-people-news-articles", "chunk_index": 9, "text": "of the neighborhood. \"I would love her to be not Julia, the kid on Sesame Street who has autism,\" the writer said. \"I would like her to be just Julia**.\" **Note:** Explore a treasure trove of concise summaries of incredibly [inspiring news articles](http://www.wanttoknow.info/inspirationalnewsarticles) on other topics which will inspire you to make a difference. **How an Aussie Man With Cerebral Palsy Tackled the Kokoda Trail** **2016-09-25, SBS (Australia's Special Broadcasting Service)** [https://www.sbs.com.au/news/the-feed/how-an-aussie-man-with-cerebral-palsy-ta...](https://www.sbs.com.au/news/the-feed/how-an-aussie-man-with-cerebral-palsy-tackled-the-kokoda-trail) **Andrew Short lives with spastic cerebral palsy**, which he contracted during birth.

Spastic is my mother tongue.\" Andrew is currently completing a Masters Degree in Disability Studies, but **his most impressive achievement has been walking the Kokoda Trail, which he describes as \"the toughest physical challenge of [his] life\"**. In Andy's late twenties, his motor function appeared to begin deteriorating. \"We were told to accept that that's what it would be,\" said [Andrew's father] David.

Andrew's physical condition is due in part to his trainer, Lee Campbell, a former army trainer and Sydney Swans team member. The two have been training together for five and a half years, and in that time Lee estimates that his physical condition has risen from 2.5 to a 7 or 8. \"You watch Andy pull a sled with 20 or 30 kilos of weights in it, he stands up, his posture is corrected,\" said Lee. \"His finer motor skills now are getting refined.

But they were sorely, extraordinarily mistaken. Today, Barnett -- now 14 -- is a Master's student, on his way to earning a PhD in quantum physics. **The teen, who boasts an IQ of 170, has already been tipped to one day win the Nobel Prize. Since enrolling at Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis (IUPUI) at the age of 10, Barnett has flourished -- astounding his professors, peers and family with his spectacular intelligence. The teen tutors other college students in subjects like calculus and is a published scientific researcher, with an IQ that is believed to be higher than that of Albert Einstein. In fact, according to a 2011 TIME report, Barnett, who frequently tops his college classes, has asserted that he may one day disprove Einstein's Theory of Relativity. Outside of his rigorous university commitments, Barnett, who has Asperger's Syndrome, is also an entrepreneur and aspiring author. The teen, who, with his family, runs a charity called Jacob's Place for kids on the spectrum, has used his story to raise awareness and dispel myths about autism.

She was 94. A two-time cancer survivor, Thompson was a regular at the San Diego Rock 'n' Roll Marathon, running with Team in Training for the Leukemia and Lymphoma Society. She started running the marathon in San Diego in 1999, and ran the race every year through 2015, except for 2003, when she was undergoing treatment for cancer. She raised more than $115,000 for cancer research through her efforts. **In 2015, at 92 years and 93 days, she finished the marathon in 7:24:36, breaking the record for oldest woman to run a marathon previously held by Gladys Burrill, who at 92 years and 19 days ran 9:53 at the Honolulu Marathon in 2010**. Thompson was slowed by many admirers who sought pictures with her during races. \"Since I'm so old, everybody wants to have their picture taken with me,\" Thompson told Runner's World in 2015. \"Brenny says, 'Don't stop her, just take a selfie,' rather than stop and take pictures all the time, because I'd never get to the end. But it's funny, all you need to do is get to be 90-something and you get lots of attention.\" In June, at age 94, Thompson completed the half marathon at San Diego in 3:42:56, also a record for oldest woman to complete the 13.1-mile distance. \"I never thought of myself as an athlete, but I feel like running is just something we all do naturally,\" Thompson said. **100-Year-Old Man Completes Marathon** **2011-10-17, NBC New York (New York City NBC affiliate)** [http://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/weird/100-Year-Old-Man-Completes-Marathon-1319...](http://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/weird/100-Year-Old-Man-Completes-Marathon-131971733.html) The most impressive performance at a Toronto marathon Sunday was turned in by the man who came in last place - and is 100 years old.

It was the eighth marathon for Singh, who was born India in 1911 and did not start running marathons until he was 89, after he moved to England following the death of his wife and son. **He says not smoking or drinking alcohol throughout his life, combined with a vegetarian diet and up to 10 miles of walking or running per day are the secrets to his health.** The Association of Road Racing Statistician already had Singh as the oldest person to complete a marathon, for one he ran seven years ago. But the Guinness Book of World Records recognized Dimitrion Yordanidis, 98, who ran in Athens in 1976. Singh recently set eight world records for his age group in one day at a special invitational meet in Toronto.

But that doesn't seem to be concern for 84-year-old Flo Meiler. In fact, this grandmother is just hitting her stride. Meiler, of Shelburne, Vermont, is a regular at the state's senior games each year. There, she competes in all of the events, [from the hurdles to the pole vaulting](https://twitter.com/bbcthree/status/1018072613237772288). **Meiler was a late bloomer to track and field. A sales rep for 30 years, she hit the track for the first time at age 60**. Five years later, she tried pole vaulting. Why? It simply seemed like fun, she believed. So she bought herself a \"How to pole vault\" video and essentially taught herself the skills she needed to compete. **With roughly 750 medals under her belt so far for her age group and senior games victories, Meiler has no plans of stopping**. She wants to continue going after records, many of which she already owns. One notable one is her six-foot pole vaulting clearance when she was 80, a world record. So if you're ever feeling insecure about your ability to start something new or reach a goal, just think about Meiler: That 84-year-old is still pole vaulting in Vermont.

By then she was heavily involved in the Catholic church after becoming a nun at the age of 23.

Duan couldn't even bend over without a big sigh,\" says Yakovlev, who photographed him in July 2011, at the age of 73. \"After 50 years of working at a glass factory ... Duan could barely walk.\" But Duan joined the group, practising stretching and breathing exercises ... and now, aged 76, can perform moves that would challenge much younger people. Yakovlev has travelled to nine countries for his project, including France, Italy and India. **Yakovlev describes the attitude that seems to link many of his subjects. \"Pat Moorehead, a skydiver, celebrated his 80th birthday by making 80 skydives in a row, non-stop. He says: 'Happiness is just a choice, a life-style. I think that is true - about happiness ... and about staying young as well**.\" **Note:** Don't miss the beautiful photos from this incredible project at the link above.

The climb marks the third time Miura has summited Everest, a successful feat in itself, but even more remarkable considering his age and his medical history. **Discussing the hurdles of climbing at such an old age, the octogenarian said, it was to challenge his \"ultimate limit.\" \"It is to honor the great Mother Nature,\" he said on a statement posted on his website. \"Hoping to raise even an inch of human possibility.\"** Miura didn't attempt his first climb to the top of Everest until 2003, when he was 70 years old.

He made that trek with his son, a former Olympian, and set a world record as the oldest climber to successfully scale the mountain. Five years later, he returned again -- at 75 years old -- to set another record. Yuichiro Miura has spent a lifetime defying the odds. In his younger years, he skied down Mount Everest's South Col, an adventure that was documented in the 1975 Academy Award winning documentary, \"The Man Who Skied Down Everest.\" Not satisfied, Miura summited and skied down all seven summits of the world, by his 50s. Miura has already discussed his next venture -- skiing down the Himalayan mountain of Cho Oyu, the sixth highest mountain in the world. He hopes to take on that challenge five years from now when he is 85 years old. **Bodybuilder, 93, with winning muscles** **2012-10-28, BBC News** [http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-20048675](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-20048675) At 93, Dr Charles Eugster cuts a dapper figure in his navy suit and matching silk handkerchief and tie. But he looks just as good in the Lycra gym suit he has on underneath, ready to spring into action like a nonagenarian superhero. This former dentist took up bodybuilding just six years ago, aged 87, yet looks very at home surrounded by the whirring fitness machines. His reasons for picking up weights in his 80s are simple. \"The idea is to turn the heads of the sexy young 70-year-old girls on the beach,\" he says. He now works out three to four times a week, often for two hours at a time, with his regime varying depending on his goals. Sometimes this involves a \"heavy session of muscle building or rowing on the lake\". And his vigorous training has clearly paid off. At a recent championship he achieved 57 dips, 61 chin-ups, 50 push-ups and 48 abdominal crunches, each in 45 seconds. Dr Eugster is no stranger to competitions. Since starting his bodybuilding training he has won several world titles for fitness and picked up many rowing medals. For 30 years while working long hours as a dentist he didn't manage to exercise regularly and began to realise his body wasn't what he wished it to be. **\"I'm extremely vain and I noticed I was getting fat,\" he said. \"In my opinion anybody can do it.

It starts [in] Squaw Valley and ends ... in Auburn, California, 100 miles distant with a cumulative altitude gain of 15,000 feet and a 22,000 foot descent. The lead runners take about 16 hours to finish. In comparison running a marathon is trivial. Thirty seven years ago my wife Ruth Anne and I created prizes for the oldest male and female finishers as a celebration of the human potential. 3500 masochists apply, 350 gain a lottery start, 280 finish, the ultimate goal is to finish under 24 hours which is rewarded by a silver buckle, the second prize is finishing under 30 hours and a bronze buckle. Last year, 2015, was Ruth Anne's last hurrah. Her Alzheimer's disease was brutal, she scarcely knew what was going. She died three weeks later, but she was there to join in the ecstasy as Gunhild Swanson became the first woman over 70 years of age to win a buckle. This year the joint was jumping as **72-year-old Wally Hesseltine hoped to be the oldest ever finisher. He made the finish in thirty hours and one minute**. I presented our awards to the oldest female and male as usual. But I gave an extra shout out to Bruce Labelle, 60 years of age who finished nobly just as he had 35 years before. Any youngster can do the 100 mile race and keep it up once or twice, but for a 60-year-old to keep it up for 35 years should be celebrated and emulated. **Note:** Watch a [12-minute video](https://vimeo.com/181118448) of 72-year-old Wally Hesseltine's attempt to complete 100 miles in 30 hours.

It might have started there, but Daprano's life as a runner took off in ways she never could have predicted. She began running competitively with 5K and 10K road races before moving to the track. **She is now the world record holder in the women's 70-year-old age group mile and the women's 75-year-old age group 400 meters and 800 meters. And she's not done. In February, Daprano took on a new challenge: her first indoor rowing competition. In classic fashion, she broke the world record in the 80-to-84 age group**, rowing 2,000 meters in 9:23.7. For those hoping to either start getting in shape or stay in shape for a long time, she offers this advice: \"Listen to your body. What are you passionate about?

He says it's why he is still sharp-minded, enjoys good balance and drives. \"I don't have any trouble with my joints, my hands are steady, my balance is good, I don't have to walk with a cane,\" he [said]. Wareham lives in Loma Linda, California, which is one of five so-called [Blue Zones](https://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_ss_i_11_14/142-3337037-1059742?url=search-alias%3Daps&field-keywords=the+blue+zones+second+edition&sprefix=the+blue+zones%2Caps%2C178&crid=CVXOIHT43T5J), so named by longevity researcher Dan Buettner because people tend to live longer, healthier lives within them. Residents of Loma Linda, many of whom like Wareham are Seventh Day Adventists, have a life expectancy that's nine to 11 years greater than that of other Americans. Seventh Day Adventists avoid smoking and alcohol, include exercise in their lifestyle and follow a vegetarian diet. The city of Loma Linda ... has several community programs in place that support its older residents. Loma Linda men in particular live six to seven years [longer than the average American man](http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=91285403). As for Dr. Wareham, he said he has \"never cared for animal products,\" so maintaining a vegan lifestyle was \"a very easy thing\" for him to do. But while what you eat certainly impacts your health, even Buettner has noted that the Blue Zones have other longevity-increasing factors. **Can Exercise Keep You Young?** **2011-03-02, *New York Times* blog** [http://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/03/02/can-exercise-keep-you-young/?hp](http://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/03/02/can-exercise-keep-you-young/?hp) We all know that physical activity is beneficial in countless ways, but even so, Dr. Mark Tarnopolsky, a professor of pediatrics at McMaster University in Hamilton, Ontario, was startled to discover that exercise kept a strain of mice from becoming gray prematurely.**", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:inspiration__inspiring-elders.txt:10:2cd6f6732791", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 11895, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "inspiration__inspiring-elders.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "inspiration__inspiring-elders", "chunk_index": 11, "text": "easy thing\" for him to do.

By the time they reached 8 months, or their early 60s in human terms, the animals were extremely frail and decrepit, with spindly muscles, shrunken brains, enlarged hearts, shriveled gonads and patchy, graying fur. All were dead before reaching a year of age. Except the mice that exercised. At 8 months, when their sedentary lab mates were bald, frail and dying, the running rats remained youthful. They had full pelts of dark fur, no salt-and-pepper shadings. They also had maintained almost all of their muscle mass and brain volume. At 1 year, none of the exercising mice had died. The researchers were surprised by the magnitude of the impact that exercise had on the animals' aging process. They had not expected that it would affect every tissue and bodily system studied. Dr. Tarnopolsky's students were impressed. \"I think they all exercise now,\" he said. **Note:** For a treasure trove of other inspiring articles published in the major media, [click here](http://www.wanttoknow.info/inspirationalnewsarticles). **The World's Oldest Barber Is 107 and Still Cutting Hair Full Time** **2018-10-07, *New York Times*** [https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/07/nyregion/worlds-oldest-barber-anthony-manc...](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/07/nyregion/worlds-oldest-barber-anthony-mancinelli.html) Anthony Mancinelli shook out a barber towel and welcomed the next customer to his chair in Fantastic Cuts, a cheery hair salon in a nondescript strip mall. \"Hey, paisan - same as usual,\" said John O'Rourke to Mr. Mancinelli, who began layering Mr. O'Rourke's hair with his steady, snipping scissors. \"I don't let anyone else touch my hair,\" said Mr. O'Rourke. \"The guy's been cutting hair for a century.\" **Mr. Mancinelli is 107 and still working full time, cutting hair five days a week from noon to 8 p.m. He has been working in barbershops since he was 11.

For Phyllis, her son was killed in the attacks on the World Trade Center. For Aicha, her son sits in jail for the rest of his life after being charged with conspiracy in connection with the attacks. Although Aicha's son was an Islamic extremist, there is no evidence to suggest he knew anything about the attacks. When Phyllis and Aicha met at a meeting supporting families impacted by the 9/11 attacks, they immediately fell into each other's arms and cried for a long time. This gave birth to an unexpected, profound friendship that transcended cultural and religious divides. As [Phyllis says in her story](https://www.theforgivenessproject.com/stories-library/phyllis-rodriguez-aicha-el-wafi/), \"meeting Aicha gave me strength and took away my anger and bitterness.\" **What does it mean to heal and forgive, in the face of the unspeakable? Or in the face of toxic cycles of dehumanization and polarization in society?** This question is at the core of [The Forgiveness Project](https://www.theforgivenessproject.com/), which explores the power of human resilience and meaningful remedies to end the cycles of war and violence in our world. Recently, I had the honor of interviewing the founder of The Forgiveness Project, journalist and peace activist Marina Cantacuzino. From gang members on opposites sides of the game to countless victims and perpetrators of war and genocide, her organization has collected [hundreds of inspiring stories](https://www.theforgivenessproject.com/stories/) of people who are finding freedom and profound healing-even in the most challenging and morally complicated of circumstances. Now, Marina has written her third book on forgiveness: [*Forgiveness: An Exploration*](https://www.amazon.com/Forgiveness-Exploration-Marina-Cantacuzino-ebook/dp/B09G3JQS8F). Marina suggests that \"**forgiveness is multifaceted, multidimensional, easily misunderstood, open to interpretation, not always welcome, and not always appropriate.**\" Yet if forgiveness is a choice, and not a prescription, the stories of the people who have chosen to forgive serve as powerful examples of what's possible.

How have Rwandans navigated forgiveness in the 25 years since the genocide in that country? Rachel Martin talks to journalist and author Philip Gourevitch, who has been documenting that process. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST: It happened 25 years ago - up to 800,000 people in Rwanda killed - mostly from the minority Tutsi community, all of that over the course of just a hundred days. Today the hundreds of thousands of people who carried out those killings live among their victims. Journalist and author Philip Gourevitch has witnessed the unique way Rwandans have defined and navigated forgiveness after the massacre. And for the majority of Rwandans who are too young to remember what happened, he says the genocide often shaped their lives in similar ways. PHILIP GOUREVITCH: It's obviously a huge shadow over them. But the difference of not having direct memory changes the relationships. But you do feel that the weight of it on the young is quite differently distributed, that they feel it differently. But obviously, if you grew up an orphan or a child of rape or in a family where, instead of 50 people, there are five and they are deeply traumatized and impoverished - or you grew up in a family where you were carrying food to your father every day in prison", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:inspiration__inspiring-story-a-constructive-path-forward-geopolitical-violence-and-suffering.txt:1:94c941d8f605", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 11901, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "inspiration__inspiring-story-a-constructive-path-forward-geopolitical-violence-and-suffering.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "inspiration__inspiring-story-a-constructive-path-forward-geopolitical-violence-and-suffering", "chunk_index": 2, "text": "not having direct memory changes the relationships. But you do feel that the weight of it on the young is quite differently distributed, that they feel it differently. But obviously, if you grew up an orphan or a child of rape or in a family where, instead of 50 people, there are five and they are deeply traumatized and impoverished - or you grew up in a family where you were carrying food to your father every day in prison and being looked at in the community as that boy, the child of a killer. **And then you both wind up, those two kids, let's say, in college from the same place. They recognize each other, and they find a way of relating to each other. That's pretty remarkable.** And it happens on a regular basis. It's something that people talk about with a kind of sense of amazement at the same time as they talk about it with a shrug, as if it were normal. And I'm not sure which one gets them through better. MARTIN: In order to navigate the aftermath of the genocide, the Rwandan government set up this nationwide reconciliation process. Can you describe how it worked? GOUREVITCH: Essentially, there was a big question. Do you have trials? Do you hold everybody accountable or attempt to? Or do you essentially say - we're going to say this was the political order, and we're going to try and hold the people at the top accountable? And the rest, as we change the political system, we're not afraid of them. And in Rwanda, there was the feeling - but no. **There was a lot of agency in the local level. And the experience of the genocide was extremely localized. People were killed by neighbors. It was intimate. They knew each other. And to simply ignore that wouldn't work.** So they set up a system of community courts - without lawyers - to sort of repurpose a system that really had only been used for small claims mitigation in traditional Rwanda, called gacaca, and have open, communal - what we might call a town hall - format for trials. And then the idea was to hold people accountable and have a system of punishment. **And this system banked very heavily on encouraging confession and rewarding it. But the confessions were supposed to be also verified by the community.** MARTIN: And what was the specific role of the victims or their surviving family members? They had to be there. And then, after verifying a certain account, were they expected to then make a public state of forgiveness or reconciliation? GOUREVITCH: They weren't necessarily in a position to verify. Many of them knew that so-and-so was always said to have killed their family members. But they weren't direct witnesses because, by virtue of their survival, that usually meant that they were", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:inspiration__inspiring-story-a-constructive-path-forward-geopolitical-violence-and-suffering.txt:2:b5b2b3673782", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 11902, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "inspiration__inspiring-story-a-constructive-path-forward-geopolitical-violence-and-suffering.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "inspiration__inspiring-story-a-constructive-path-forward-geopolitical-violence-and-suffering", "chunk_index": 3, "text": "And what was the specific role of the victims or their surviving family members?

GOUREVITCH: They weren't necessarily in a position to verify. Many of them knew that so-and-so was always said to have killed their family members. But they weren't direct witnesses because, by virtue of their survival, that usually meant that they were either somewhere else or well-hidden or had escaped or... MARTIN: Not present, yeah. GOUREVITCH: Yes. So in many cases, it's the testimony of other members of the community that would be specific and then these confessions, which were very, very graphic. **And so the motto of the gacaca courts was, truth heals.** But as we know, truth can also be really traumatizing and, in this case, retraumatizing because, to go from the idea that - that person is the killer of my family, and I want him to answer for it - to then hearing him describe in quite gory detail and often quite coarsely how he'd gone about killing, let's say, your family members and, at that moment, be asked to accept and forgive him, that's an awful lot to ask at that moment. But what's interesting to me, too, is - what does forgiveness mean? I mean, to some extent, when I went and I heard the word forgiveness, I thought it sort of meant you'd restore whatever the relationship was before. MARTIN: Yeah. GOUREVITCH: And they would say, no, that involves trust. That's a whole different thing. **Forgiveness doesn't require trust. Forgiveness simply means letting go of the idea of getting even, forgoing the idea of revenge. Right? Now, even that's a big ask. But it means accepting coexistence.** MARTIN: Right. I mean, is there any way to determine if the gacaca reconciliation process was the reason why Rwanda was able to move forward? I mean, it was an exceptional, nationwide reckoning. GOUREVITCH: **There's never been as comprehensive a reckoning with such communal violence or mass atrocity. **I think Rwandans at the time found it very tough. It created a lot of tension because it was an ongoing, multi-year confrontation with the past in the communities. I think in the aftermath of it, you find that the genocide is no longer an unaddressed, looming problem that, in a sense, is both behind and before them - that it was something that had to be done in order for whatever one might call reconciliation. And one of the things that I often heard people say - you'd ask them how it was going. And they'd start to say, well, for me, it's really very tough still. You know, I'm not at all at ease with this or that or the other thing.

You know, I'm not at all at ease with this or that or the other thing. But then they would say, even as they complained about much of what was being asked of them by having to live together, they would say - but you know, in general - in society, things are much better. I started to hear this, especially towards the end of gacaca and in the years since. I took that as a very interesting thing - saying, well, you know, my pains are not gone; my struggles are not over. But the general balance is good. **And that means that they felt like something had been gained even if they themselves were not fully at peace - in other words, that the societal peace had been served maybe better than any given individual peace.** MARTIN: It's a starting point. GOUREVITCH: Yeah. Yeah, I think so - because one wants not to have to accept certain things. It feels like something should be unforgivable. And yet, confronted with that alternative, you can end up in a situation where, you know, just the urge for punitive resolution makes it impossible to continue.

How have Rwandans navigated forgiveness in the 25 years since the genocide in that country? Rachel Martin talks to journalist and author Philip Gourevitch, who has been documenting that process. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST: It happened 25 years ago - up to 800,000 people in Rwanda killed - mostly from the minority Tutsi community, all of that over the course of just a hundred days. Today the hundreds of thousands of people who carried out those killings live among their victims. Journalist and author Philip Gourevitch has witnessed the unique way Rwandans have defined and navigated forgiveness after the massacre. And for the majority of Rwandans who are too young to remember what happened, he says the genocide often shaped their lives in similar ways. PHILIP GOUREVITCH: It's obviously a huge shadow over them. But the difference of not having direct memory changes the relationships. But you do feel that the weight of it on the young is quite differently distributed, that they feel it differently. But obviously, if you grew up an orphan", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:inspiration__inspiring-story-a-path-beyond-geopolitical-violence-and-suffering.txt:1:e206b0450192", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 11906, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "inspiration__inspiring-story-a-path-beyond-geopolitical-violence-and-suffering.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "inspiration__inspiring-story-a-path-beyond-geopolitical-violence-and-suffering", "chunk_index": 2, "text": "and navigated forgiveness after the massacre.

But the difference of not having direct memory changes the relationships. But you do feel that the weight of it on the young is quite differently distributed, that they feel it differently. But obviously, if you grew up an orphan or a child of rape or in a family where, instead of 50 people, there are five and they are deeply traumatized and impoverished - or you grew up in a family where you were carrying food to your father every day in prison and being looked at in the community as that boy, the child of a killer. **And then you both wind up, those two kids, let's say, in college from the same place. They recognize each other, and they find a way of relating to each other. That's pretty remarkable.** And it happens on a regular basis. It's something that people talk about with a kind of sense of amazement at the same time as they talk about it with a shrug, as if it were normal. And I'm not sure which one gets them through better. MARTIN: In order to navigate the aftermath of the genocide, the Rwandan government set up this nationwide reconciliation process. Can you describe how it worked? GOUREVITCH: Essentially, there was a big question. Do you have trials? Do you hold everybody accountable or attempt to? Or do you essentially say - we're going to say this was the political order, and we're going to try and hold the people at the top accountable? And the rest, as we change the political system, we're not afraid of them. And in Rwanda, there was the feeling - but no. **There was a lot of agency in the local level. And the experience of the genocide was extremely localized. People were killed by neighbors. It was intimate. They knew each other. And to simply ignore that wouldn't work.** So they set up a system of community courts - without lawyers - to sort of repurpose a system that really had only been used for small claims mitigation in traditional Rwanda, called gacaca, and have open, communal - what we might call a town hall - format for trials. And then the idea was to hold people accountable and have a system of punishment. **And this system banked very heavily on encouraging confession and rewarding it. But the confessions were supposed to be also verified by the community.** MARTIN: And what was the specific role of the victims or their surviving family members? They had to be there. And then, after verifying a certain account, were they expected to then make a public state of", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:inspiration__inspiring-story-a-path-beyond-geopolitical-violence-and-suffering.txt:2:09631263b474", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 11907, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "inspiration__inspiring-story-a-path-beyond-geopolitical-violence-and-suffering.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "inspiration__inspiring-story-a-path-beyond-geopolitical-violence-and-suffering", "chunk_index": 3, "text": "- format for trials.

And then, after verifying a certain account, were they expected to then make a public state of forgiveness or reconciliation? GOUREVITCH: They weren't necessarily in a position to verify. Many of them knew that so-and-so was always said to have killed their family members. But they weren't direct witnesses because, by virtue of their survival, that usually meant that they were either somewhere else or well-hidden or had escaped or... MARTIN: Not present, yeah. GOUREVITCH: Yes. So in many cases, it's the testimony of other members of the community that would be specific and then these confessions, which were very, very graphic. **And so the motto of the gacaca courts was, truth heals.** But as we know, truth can also be really traumatizing and, in this case, retraumatizing because, to go from the idea that - that person is the killer of my family, and I want him to answer for it - to then hearing him describe in quite gory detail and often quite coarsely how he'd gone about killing, let's say, your family members and, at that moment, be asked to accept and forgive him, that's an awful lot to ask at that moment. But what's interesting to me, too, is - what does forgiveness mean? I mean, to some extent, when I went and I heard the word forgiveness, I thought it sort of meant you'd restore whatever the relationship was before. MARTIN: Yeah. GOUREVITCH: And they would say, no, that involves trust. That's a whole different thing. **Forgiveness doesn't require trust. Forgiveness simply means letting go of the idea of getting even, forgoing the idea of revenge. Right? Now, even that's a big ask. But it means accepting coexistence.** MARTIN: Right. I mean, is there any way to determine if the gacaca reconciliation process was the reason why Rwanda was able to move forward? I mean, it was an exceptional, nationwide reckoning. GOUREVITCH: **There's never been as comprehensive a reckoning with such communal violence or mass atrocity. **I think Rwandans at the time found it very tough. It created a lot of tension because it was an ongoing, multi-year confrontation with the past in the communities. I think in the aftermath of it, you find that the genocide is no longer an unaddressed, looming problem that, in a sense, is both behind and before them - that it was something that had to be done in order for whatever one might call reconciliation.

And one of the things that I often heard people say - you'd ask them how it was going. And they'd start to say, well, for me, it's really very tough still. You know, I'm not at all at ease with this or that or the other thing. But then they would say, even as they complained about much of what was being asked of them by having to live together, they would say - but you know, in general - in society, things are much better. I started to hear this, especially towards the end of gacaca and in the years since. I took that as a very interesting thing - saying, well, you know, my pains are not gone; my struggles are not over. But the general balance is good. **And that means that they felt like something had been gained even if they themselves were not fully at peace - in other words, that the societal peace had been served maybe better than any given individual peace.** MARTIN: It's a starting point. GOUREVITCH: Yeah. Yeah, I think so - because one wants not to have to accept certain things. It feels like something should be unforgivable. And yet, confronted with that alternative, you can end up in a situation where, you know, just the urge for punitive resolution makes it impossible to continue.

At that time, I was the State Department's top Indonesian language interpreter. I had interpreted for Bill Clinton, George W. Bush, and other top dignitaries in the White House and elsewhere. It all started in December 1999, when I went on a three-week vacation to the Yucatan in Mexico with my girlfriend. After a week there, she was feeling bored. Having seen the engaging movie *Buena Vista Social Club*, which richly depicts the lively music and culture of Cuba, she insisted that we visit this sub-tropical island nation, so I reluctantly agreed. At the time we decided to go, I hadn't heard about any problems with people traveling there. If I had any idea what was to come, I would never have gone to Cuba and threatened my job as a language interpreter with the State Department. Our 10 full days in Cuba were filled with great times. On the flight over, we were excited to befriend a fun, vibrant Afro-Cuban drummer sitting next to us who lived in Havana with his family. He not only set us up to stay in the apartment of a friend, he invited us to his beautiful 15-year-old daughter's colorful quincinera or coming of age celebration. We also enjoyed swimming at the warm sandy beaches, exploring Cuba's rich music and culture, and lots more in our time there. Two days before flying there, I found a used Cuba guidebook in the Yucatan. **The guidebook stated it was not illegal to go to Cuba, but that technically Americans were not allowed to spend money there, as it is considering aiding the enemy.** Yet the guidebook also mentioned they had never heard of anyone having a problem with this, and that well over 100,000 Americans were visiting Cuba every year. So on returning to the U.S. from our trip, I wasn't expecting any problem from writing on the customs form that we had visited Mexico and Cuba. Upon then going through customs, we were shocked to be pulled aside and then detained for two hours. They first read us our Miranda rights and then separated and interrogated us all because we had gone to Cuba. During the interrogation, I asked the customs agent if it was illegal to go to Cuba. I was most curious that, though we were being treated like criminals, the agent avoided answering this question and wouldn't tell me why we were being detained. We were eventually released and told that we didn't have to do anything, but that we might hear from them again. About six", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:inspiration__investigation_heart_connection.txt:0:43f18541acef", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 11911, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "inspiration__investigation_heart_connection.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "inspiration__investigation_heart_connection", "chunk_index": 1, "text": "rights and then separated and interrogated us all because we had gone to Cuba.

I was most curious that, though we were being treated like criminals, the agent avoided answering this question and wouldn't tell me why we were being detained. We were eventually released and told that we didn't have to do anything, but that we might hear from them again. About six months later, we received letters stating that we were under investigation, but didn't need to do anything. Then **nothing happened until over three years later, when I was shocked to receive a letter stating that I had to pay a penalty of $7,590 for my visit to Cuba!** I later confirmed that it was not illegal to go to Cuba. I was facing this fine because of the regulation against spending money there. This regulation was designed as a way of bypassing the Supreme Court's decision that Americans have the [right to travel](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kent_v._Dulles) freely anywhere in the world. This all seemed very unfair to me, as it thankfully does to a whole team of lawyers across the US. One member of this team is representing me for free in challenging this fine in court. The case is still in limbo now, well over 20 years after my Cuba visit. Yet as a result of this ongoing case, in early 2004 the State Department sent a special investigator to my house to question me about the case. His duty was to evaluate if I was still fit to work as a language interpreter with the U.S. government. Remember that at the time I was the top Indonesian interpreter for the State Department ([click here](https://www.inspiringcommunity.org/inspiringstories0111#fred) to read the many little miracles that led to this). I was very well liked by my boss and many others at the Office of Language Services there. Yet, if serious concerns were aroused by this investigation into my Cuba visit and the ensuing court case, I might lose my fascinating work as an interpreter. Upon hearing I would be investigated, I knew immediately what to do. I first opened to my deepest life intention of [what's best for all](https://www.weboflove.org/keystolife#whatsbest) in this situation, fully trusting that I am always guided to what's best for me and for all in everything I do. **I then opened my heart and energetically communicated with the heart of the investigator who was to visit. I mentally communicated to him that I had no desire to hide anything, and that I warmly welcomed his visit. ** As I opened the door on the day of the investigation a week later, I also opened my heart to this investigator and warmly invited him to my room.

Within minutes, a deep feeling of friendship bonded us. He commented that he was very impressed at how open I was, and at how I was so willing to tell him anything and everything about myself and my Cuba visit. As he then ran through pages of questions regarding my Cuba case and more, he even told me how to answer some questions. For example, one question was, \"Have you ever used any illegal drugs?\" I responded, \"Well, back when I was young, I did a few...\" But he cut me off saying, \"We'll say no.\" I countered, \"I am deeply committed to speaking the truth. I think it's best to write down the true answers to these questions.\" He looked at me very seriously and stated emphatically, \"I know what they mean by this question, and we'll say no.\" When I questioned him, he said I didn't have to sign anything, so as he was doing the writing, I agreed to let him do what he felt was best. Towards the end of the long list of questions, he read this one: \"Have you ever been involved in any activities which might embarrass the United States government?\" I told him that I manage a website ([WantToKnow.info](https://www.WantToKnow.info)) which is all about exposing major government cover-ups, which some people might feel embarrasses the government. I added that I personally didn't at all feel that this is embarrassing to the government, but rather that this website was designed as a call to caring American citizens to help bring our government back to full democracy. At this unexpected response, the investigator put down his clipboard. He looked me straight in the eyes for several seconds with a stern look before finally saying, \"Well ... I worked for 25 years with the FBI, and I want to tell you about some cover-ups I saw there.\" He went on to reveal some valuable information on corruption and cover-ups in the FBI that I had not heard before. I was truly amazed. **Here this man was sent by the government to investigate me, yet he ended up not only actively helping me to keep my job, but also revealing to me some major cover-ups he had personally seen in his time working with the government!** Life often works in wondrous, unexpected ways, especially with those who are deeply dedicated to doing what is best.

Yet everyday, this safety net of love continues to show up in our daily lives as well as in in extraodinary experiences. **[Love brings the best of heart intelligence](https://www.wanttoknow.info/inspiration/love-in-action-inspiring-story) to all aspects of our lives.** And [through science](https://www.heartmath.org/research/science-of-the-heart/), we know that the heart has its own electromagnetic field that affects others around us. Many wisdom traditions see the heart as an organ of inner vision, allowing us to see the deeper meaning in everything we do, from ordinary daily events to the most challenging of circumstances. As nonviolent activist Kazu Haga once said, \"if we carry intergenerational trauma, we also carry intergenerational wisdom\" inside all of us. As we open up to the holiday spirit of giving thanks, we hope you enjoy our collection of beautiful human stories, where love effortlessly weaves its magic-connecting (and saving) us in ways we often overlook.

Wan Zuocheng and Hong Gengxiang have been doing this charity work for two decades. \"No matter what life throws at you, you must eat good food,\" Mr. Wan told *South China Morning Post*. **For just 3 RMB, the equivalent of around $0.32, anyone can use the kitchen spaces they've set up in the alleyway to cook meals.

So we let them use our kitchen.\" As time passed they added more utensils, appliances, stoves, and ovens to their stall. This came with gradually increasing use of water, electricity, and coal, but as the costs rose, so too did the community, supporting the couple and their efforts to provide the invaluable service they relied on. Donations began to outpace expenditures, and now nearly 10,000 people come to cook in the cancer kitchen. It's been thoroughly observed in medicine that the odds of beating cancer can be improved with positivity, and what could be more positive than a loved one bringing you a home-cooked meal? **Note:** Explore more positive stories like this on [healing our bodies](https://wanttoknow.info/healing-our-bodiesmediaarticles) and [healing social division](https://wanttoknow.info/healing-our-relationshipsmediaarticles). **Growing Food Instead of Lawns in California Front Yards** **November 5, 2024, *New York Times*** [https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/05/climate/microfarms-cropswapla...](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/05/climate/microfarms-cropswapla-food-deserts.html) Tangles of grapes and blackberries grow in clusters along a trellis. Leafy rows of basil, sweet potatoes and mesclun spring from raised garden troughs. Most striking are corridors of elevated planters stacked four high, like multilevel bunk beds, filled with kale, cabbage, arugula, various lettuces, eggplants, tatsoi and collard greens. **Run by a gardening wizard named Jamiah Hargins, this wee farm in the front yard of his bungalow provides fresh produce for 45 nearby families, all while using a tiny fraction of the water required by a lawn**. At just 2,500 square feet, this farm forms the heart of Mr. Hargins's nonprofit, Crop Swap LA, which transforms yards and unused spaces into microfarms. It runs three front yard farms that provide organic fruits and vegetables each week to 80 families, all living in a one-mile radius, and often with food insecurity. Rooted in the empowering idea that people can grow their own food, **Crop Swap LA has caught on, with a wait list of 300 residents wanting to convert their yards into microfarms.** The mini farms bring environmental benefits, thanks to irrigation and containment systems that capture and recycle rain.

In late 2012, Brice Royer was lying on a bed in terrible pain, thinking about how to kill himself. Today, the pain is still there and the malignant tumour in his stomach is no smaller. But he has never been happier. **A year ago, Royer, 31, decided to give and receive freely without the use of money in an effort to build community**. Thinking he was staring down a death sentence, Royer [researched] and reflect on the causes of illness. Toxins in the environment. Loneliness. Stress. The root cause (is) a lack of love in our society, Royer says. Royer researched where the healthiest people in the world live. They all take care of each other. They all have something called the gift economy. They are isolated from the market economy. [He] suggested to a friend that they practise this within their own circle using a Facebook group. [Roy] offered to pay someone else's rent ... for a year instead of his own. The woman he helped was a chronically ill single mother. He helped another stranger, a war veteran with an autistic son, by paying her dentist to remove the mercury amalgam fillings from her teeth that were making her sick. **\"After I started giving unconditional love to strangers, gifts came back to help me, sometimes in very unexpected ways.\"** Sometimes the gifts came in the form of carrots, the only food Royer can eat in any quantity without getting sick. (Shortly after Royer posted the Craigslist ad, people all over the world started posting pictures of themselves with carrots to show their support, using the hashtag #EatCarrotsForBrice.)

There are probably more than 40,000 members in over 500 time banks in the US. Many time banks are volunteer community projects, but the one in Sebastopol, [CA] is funded by the city. \"Every volunteer hour is valued around $29,\" Wyatt calculates. \"Now think about the thousands of dollars a city saves when hundreds of citizens serve their community for free.\" The Sebastopol time bank has banked more than 8,000 hours since its launch in 2016. Five core principles ... guide time banks to this day: First, everyone has something to contribute. Second, valuing volunteering as \"work.\" Third, reciprocity or a \"pay-it-forward\" ethos. Fourth, community building, and fifth, mutual accountability and respect. \"What captured me is that people are doing things out of their own good heart,\" Wyatt says. **\"Many years ago, a woman ... said to [civil rights lawyer] Edgar Cahn, 'I have nothing to give.'

He also noticed something concerning. \"I saw the unbelievable thinness of our planet's atmosphere,\" the astronaut remarked. **That \"paper-thin\" atmosphere is all that stands between humanity and disaster. Garan was troubled by how easily this fact is overshadowed by economic priorities. \"I saw an iridescent biosphere teeming with life. I didn't see the economy**. But since our human-made systems treat everything, including the very life-support systems of our planet, as the wholly owned subsidiary of the global economy, it's obvious from the vantage point of space that we're living a lie,\" he said.

There's this light bulb that pops up where they realize how interconnected and interdependent we all are,\" the astronaut explained. \"When we can evolve beyond a two-dimensional us versus them mindset, and embrace the true multi-dimensional reality of the universe that we live in, that's when we're going to no longer be floating in darkness.

Joseph Kony is the cruel rebel leader behind this orgy of hate. **Jason's warm and touching relationship with Jacob, a young escapee from Kony's army, becomes the vehicle which invites us to connect with this disturbing reality in a most inspiring way. ** It's definitely not a pleasant subject, yet this beautiful 30-minute film is not at all unpleasant to watch.

Highlighting key cases where individuals were declared clinically dead for a period of time and then came back to life, **powerful evidence is presented that consciousness can, in fact, separate from the body to see and experience things not possible from inside the body.** View this amazing exploration of life after death at this link: [**https://www.personalgrowthcourses.net/video/inspiring/nde_day_i_died_bbc**](https://www.personalgrowthcourses.net/video/inspiring/nde_day_i_died_bbc) In this thought-provoking documentary, you will meet [Vicki Noratuk](https://web.archive.org/web/20080408115407/http://www.seattleiands.org/stories/blind.htm), who has been blind from birth. Until Vicki's life after death experience, she had no concept of what the visible world was like. But upon leaving her body as a result of a bad car accident, she was astounded to suddenly be able to see. She went on to have a powerfully transformative experience. Once Vicki came back into her body in the hospital, she once again was blind, yet was incredibly grateful for having experienced sight and much more in her sojourn into the realms beyond. You will also meet [Pam Reynolds](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pam_Reynolds_%28singer%29), who was facing imminent death from a massive brain aneurysm. She opted for a highly risky procedure where neurosurgeon Dr. Robert Spetzler deliberately brought her to a state where all of her vital signs, including all brain activity, were stopped for an extended period of surgery. All blood was removed from her head. Clinically, Pam was dead for that period. Yet on being successfully revived, she came back a transformed woman with an amazingly inspiring story to share of where her consciousness went while her body functions stopped. And then there is the transformational story of Gordon Allen. Before his life after death experience Gordon was all about making money. And he was quite successful in his ruthless business world. After going through death, however, all of that changed. Learn about the most remarkable way the life of this once greedy man turned around in this beautifully compiled documentary. **A number of doctors and surgeons also give engaging interviews, including both skeptics of life after death and those who say that there is no explanation other than the possibility that consciousness can exist and perceive outside of the physical body.** A few doctors were so intrigued with what they heard from patients who had come back from clinical death that they initiated extensive studies into the near-death phenomenon. And the results are quite amazing. Another video and two well documented stories on near-death experiences and life after death are well worth exploring.

Why should I fear that which cannot exist when I do? * ~ Epicurus **When faced with the potential of imminent death, most people suddenly find that life takes on a whole new perspective.** Suddenly all of the belongings they might have accumulated seem quite meaningless, while the relationships formed and love shared take on great significance. Some have had the rare opportunity to pass through the portal of death and return, only to find their understanding of life radically transformed. A recently developed field of study for these near-death experiences (NDEs) has blossomed and provided us with inspiring, true stories of of those who have experienced life after death and come back. A number of doctors and scientists have even dedicated themselves to finding and studying these life after death stories - the experiences of those who were actually declared clinically dead, yet somehow came back to life. The amazing results have been published in numerous books and on inspiring websites (see end of lesson for a few of these). For a three-page summary of the astonishing, deeply moving experience of one man who traveled far into mystical realms after dying, yet came back to tell us about it, click below to read the riveting story of Mellen-Thomas Benedict.

During his experience out of his body, he went through a life review where he personally experienced every feeling and emotion he had caused in his life. **Dannion not only experienced the pain, suffering, and fear of those he killed, but also all of the grief and other emotions of family members of those he killed in his military work. ** Imagine for a moment what it would be like to experience every emotion that you ever caused to every person whose life you have touched. Imagine what it would be like to feel even the emotional ripple effects of your actions on others you don't know. How does that feel?

Those who take this course have a wide diversity of beliefs on reincarnation. Some have vivid memories of past lives. Others are skeptical. Some feel that past lives are only relevant to the extent that they affect our present experience. **We do not promote any particular beliefs, yet we welcome constructive dialogue and sharing of experiences on engaging topics like this.** We do feel that the present moment - the eternal sacred now - is the most important place to focus our attention and intention, yet past experiences and future concerns most certainly can have an impact on the here and now. Many have found that the rigid segmentation of time so prevalent in the old paradigm does not resonate with their experience of reality. Time may be much more fluid than we are raised to believe. Some have found it very powerful to breathe sacred love with themselves in the past and future. **Consider closing your eyes and imagining yourself at a particularly difficult time in the past. Once you have that difficult memory clear, connect with that past self that is you. When you can feel a connection, [breathe sacred love](https://www.weboflove.org/index#breathing) in and out with that past aspect of yourself.** Allow the sacred love you breathe now to envelope your past self and shift the difficult energy around the experience. Take a moment now to stop reading and explore this possibility. Now imagine yourself at a time in the future when you might want some support. Breathe love to that future self. Some involved with this course have been doing this for years, so that any time they go through challenging experiences, they have only to breathe and open their hearts to feel all of the love and support being sent to them by their past selves from the many times in the past when they have sent love to that future self. Take a moment now to breathe sacred love with your future self. **Expanding that further, you can breathe sacred love with all of your past and future selves**, whether or not you believe in reincarnation.

We can choose now to open ourselves to the infinite ways in which we can love and support ourselves and all around us.

Take some time now to put on some beautiful music and ask for spiritual guidance as you close your eyes, dive within, and create your own near-death experience with full life review. Notice how much of your understanding of life is based on the physical world around you. Are you open to the possibility that, as Einstein postulated, all matter is actually a form of energy? Rather than focusing on the words spoken and what your eyes see, play with feeling the energy of every person you meet and feeling the underlying energetics of your interactions. What are your views on reincarnation? Open to the possibility of past and future aspects or incarnations of yourself. Consider communicating with them and even asking for guidance. You can also offer love and guidance, and breathe love with your past and future selves. What is your relationship with your ancestors? How do they affect you? Are there places you would like to heal around this? Open to heart connection with anyone you know who has died. Do the same with any spirits or non-embodied spiritual guides who may be assisting in your spiritual development. Take a moment now to breathe sacred love and gratitude with them and with your ancestors. As you pass people casually on the street or in a store, play with sending a \"mental hello,\" where you simply think and feel a hello and send it to a person without any words or movement. Notice if you feel any response as you do. Close your eyes and send a mental hello right now to a friend or family member who lives far away. Again open your heart and notice if you feel any energetic response. Breathe some sacred love with them afterward. **For Those Who Want More** **[https://www.weboflove.org/inspiringres...](https://www.weboflove.org/nde/near-death-experiences-nde) - Near-Death Experience Resources** Links to several incredibly rich and inspiring documentaries and true stories on fascinating near-death experiences.

This alignment enhances the life energy that flows past the individual with the clear intent of gentle support. It is the action of opening to the highest motive in all people and in all life, and supporting the flow of this highest intention towards its ultimate expression. It involves simply nurturing the highest energy that flows from all people and all beings, and thus supporting the fullest expression of their deepest essence.\"** **Note:** For a two-page summary of this inspiring essay on life transformation, [click here](https://www.WantToKnow.info/transformation). Each individual on Earth is exploring in a physical body new ways of experiencing life. Through this process of discovery, each of us is developing a deeper level of understanding of life and a greater ability to express our unique essence. Profound life transformation is initiated by the realization that you are capable of connecting with All That Is, that you and all of us have direct access to the divine. This is the realization that the collective wisdom of the All That Is can be discovered deep within your own consciousness. There is a wide range of means that can facilitate self-mastery through personal transformation and disengage consciousness from external controls. Inasmuch as the means may vary, the intent behind the means is quite narrowly defined as the intent to expand into a state of integration whereby all aspects of your conscious self become increasingly aligned with your divine essence. **There are three particular principles that help to align your perspective with the perspective of divine essence and thus inspire profound life transformation. They are: 1) seeing the divine spark in all; 2) nurturance of life; and 3) gratitude.** When you apply these principles, a deeper meaning will be revealed to the seemingly random events of your life experience. **Seeing the Divine Spark in All** This is the principle that the divine is present and can be seen everywhere and in all manifestations of life. It is interwoven in all things like an intricate mosaic whose pieces adhere to the same wall, and are thus unified. However, it is not the picture that unifies the mosaic, but the underlying wall upon which its pieces adhere. Similarly, the divine paints a picture so diverse and seemingly unrelated that there appears to be no unification. Yet it is not the outward manifestations that unify. It is the inward center of divine energy upon which the pieces of diversity are layered that unifies all life. This centerpiece of divine energy is the collective storehouse of all life within the universe. It is the full expression of the divine, which invests itself in all forms through the projection of its divine intelligence into all manifestations", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:inspiration__life_transformation.txt:0:4c6e60fb1566", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 11935, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "inspiration__life_transformation.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "inspiration__life_transformation", "chunk_index": 9, "text": "just read is an edited translation into everyday English from the esoterically worded original.

Though there are an abundance of exciting things happening in our world, these are intense times for many people. **It is easy to slip into fear and be overwhelmed with all of the darkness out in the world and in our lives.** Yet what if we choose not to be afraid of the dark? What might happen if in the face of darkness we choose to open to opportunities for growth? What if we join forces as we endeavor to shine light into the darkness? The insightful essay below provides some rich inspiration along these lines. Enjoy, and have a beautiful day! With very best wishes for a transformed world, [Fred Burks](https://www.WantToKnow.info/aboutus#burks) for [PEERS](https://www.peerservice.org) and [WantToKnow.info](https://www.WantToKnow.info) **Are You Afraid of the Dark?** **These are very strange times on planet Earth.** You sit at the precipice. You sit at the edge of a great event. You have placed yourself here specifically at this moment, and many of you know that deep in your hearts. You know somewhere there is one thing that you came to do above everything else. We tell you that you are now getting the opportunity to do that. It is happening! Yes, there are difficult times ahead as you go through these changes, partly because of your own perceptions of what you believe to be difficult, and what you perceive as lack of support. We wish to speak to you about this, because in these times, this is when fear begins. You have shown incredible strength at your willingness to release old belief systems. Yet the first time you get scared, you jump back into the old belief systems. There is nothing wrong with that, it is simply the human way of advancing three steps forward followed by one step back. **As long as you do not judge yourself there is no problem, for it is your perception of yourself that creates your experience of reality. ** **How Do You Wish to See Your World?** You will see darkness. You will also see fear. Let us speak for a moment about fear and darkness ... and evil. We think it so humorous that even some world leaders have used the word 'evil.' What a silly thing to do, for they are looking in the mirror when they do that. Can your right hand call your left hand evil? It does not work. So, what is evil? What is darkness, and what is fear? That is what we wish to address today, because **as you move forward into your own evolution you will begin to perceive darkness, fear, loneliness and a lack of support differently than you ever have before.** That is where you stand today - right at the edge of this door that is opening.

Many of you will see darkness. We hope you will consider a different perception of it, because an empowered human sees darkness differently. They see fear differently. It is not right. It is not wrong. It is not black. It is not white. It is not good. It is not bad. Those are the polarities that have confused people up to this point. What we wish to ask you today is, how do you wish to see your world? **These same darknesses can be viewed as opportunities for light.** These same dark challenges can be viewed as the door opening to a whole new arena for you. These are opportunities for lightworkers to shine their light in new energetic ways. **Darkness is Only a Lack of Light** Darkness is only a lack of light. If you block the sun with your hand, a shadow results on the ground. Artists look at those shadows and say, \"Ooooh, I can do all sorts of things with these!\" **Photographers look at that shadow and say, \"Wouldn't this be fascinating to capture?\"** Many of you look at the shadows and say, \"Oh. That is darkness, and I only choose light in my life.\" There are even times when you turn and run from darkness which is actually there to feed your spirit. Darkness gives you an opportunity to shine your light, your confidence, your knowingness ... in a way that you have never done before. Yes, it will be scary the first time, but remember that you are not alone. Look around you. There is a huge family that is awakening to this at this time. This is no longer on the fringe of societies. You will not find that one day everyone has suddenly awakened from the dream, or see a lead story on the news about how the light came to Earth. It is going to be a very gradual process that filters into humanity very quietly from several sources to reach a critical mass, when it can then naturally reach the level of general consciousness. It is different this time, and **if you look at these opportunities for light, you will find things that you never dreamed were possible in your own world today.** This is the reason we have been giving [healing modalities](https://www.WantToKnow.info/healthnewsarticles); there are many more healing modalities coming to this Earth at this time. The good news is that", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:inspiration__light_and_darkness.txt:1:874a3d81eea8", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 11939, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "inspiration__light_and_darkness.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "inspiration__light_and_darkness", "chunk_index": 2, "text": "into humanity very quietly from several sources to reach a critical mass, when it can then naturally reach the level of general consciousness.

The good news is that all of them work. The bad news is that you will have to find out which ones work best for you. Nobody can do that except for you. So, why healing in the first place? In order for you to carry the light that you are going to do your work, it is important to release your own restrictions to that light. Heal and clear the energetic structures within so that you can anchor, as spirit, fully in the physical body. That is difficult, for spirits are not of the physical body. Your spirit is pretending to have a human experience right now, and that is what we wish to finally bring you this day - that human experience. It includes light and dark. It includes sadness. It includes finding the beauty in the darkness. **Activating the Network of Light** People in general try to avoid sadness, difficulties, and dark energies. However, we tell you that most music on this planet has been inspired by these dark energies. **Most of the beauty that you truly find comes from the shadows hitting light in a certain way. Finding the beauty in the darkness will be a key role as empowered beings and lightworkers.** Finding those opportunities for light is now at hand for all people. You have placed yourself in key positions all over the world to be there at the right time with the right energy. You have made it. You are here! The time is right, and now we ask you to look at the darkness for all the beauty that it holds. Look at those restrictions, those negativities, the horrible things that are being reported in your news. See them as opportunities for light, because these are the things that will catalyze your further growth. Keep in mind as you do this that you are not the physical body at all. Many of you push away those physical parts and deny those pieces of yourself in order to be spirits. We tell you, however, that in fact you have no problem being spirits. It is being human that is the problem. **You are here as spirits to have a human experience, and that includes light and dark, failure and success.** Those are only labels placed upon your journey as you go forward, but they mean nothing when you get Home.

The parts you will re-member are how you found beauty in the darkness - how you found your part of your world to share. That is the piece you came to do, and we tell you now is the time. ** Earth Hologram** There is a total re-working of many events that will happen over the next seven to ten years. As a result, this hologram of light is overimprinting the original hologram of Earth. **The Earth that you are creating through your own thoughts and your own process is creating a hologram that will now overimprint the [original hologram of Earth](https://www.personalgrowthcourses.net/stories/talbot.universe_hologram).** As that begins to happen, organizations and gatherings of souls that are not in harmony with this advanced state will start to fall apart and crumble. Some systems will not make it from one level to the next, yet that does not mean collapse. Much the same way we have shown you that as one system leaves, another comes right in to take that place, so will it be with your economic systems. You simply have to keep your eyes open for the possibilities, because that is what will create it. When you expect a miracle, it happens. We tell you that is more difficult to do because your ideas and concepts of miracles put limitations on the fulfillment of them. Many times when you say, \"I want this so I need to be specific. I have to say exactly what it is I want, I have to mention the color, how much it will cost and all the details.\" But specifics are the old energy. **You actually limit spirit's fulfillment of your dreams when you are specific.** Grab the essence of your heart energy around that creation and let Spirit fulfill it for you, because it will fulfill it in ways that will grow with you and not limit you to your belief systems. Those are the possibilities that are starting to happen right now. You are not accustomed to seeing the daily negativity in the news as opportunities for spreading light, so this message may be difficult for some. If you would simply step in that direction and look for those potentials and possibilities, you will find heaven being created on Earth as you speak.

You will also see many who will come to the forefront during difficult times, who will specifically request to be the new healers with 'the' answers. Please understand that as you move forward, you do not need leaders to lead you in the ways they once did. It is no longer necessary to have the types of leaders you have had on this planet. **It is time for you to take power yourselves, in your own reality first, and then your leaders will see what you need for support.** Those are the potentials and the direction humanity is heading at the moment. **An Overview** **As all of you change your evolutionary structure, you will step further into what you came to do, and you raise the collective vibrations of humanity on all levels.** That is what is taking place right now. We see the times that you cry because you are lonely for soul family, and have few who understand and empower you. We see the times you think you do not have anything to say, and all the dreams you have of something important you came to do here. You cannot be hurt in the ways that you think you can. It is like sending you out in the backyard of Earth to play. There are certain toys you might hurt yourself with, but yet you are not restricted from those toys. You go find yourself. You go play. You find your light. You find your darkness. You find a blend of a spirit being human. That is the most important part of the next stage of work - being fully grounded in your own physical being means that your spirit is anchored in the physical being. That is hard to do because you were not born that way. The reality is, you were never born. You simply evolved from one energy to the next and took another form, because as you leave one form, you enter another. There is no such thing as time on the other side of the veil. The illusion of time only exists here, so it is possible for you to weave many paths as a soul pretending to be a human.

The converging crises of rising national debt, failing institutions, ecological collapse, a deadly chronic disease epidemic, and authoritarianism across the political spectrum are signaling that business as usual cannot hold. If and when systems collapse, what will we choose to build together? The dominant form of power-centralized, money-driven, and extractive-continues to grow, while the power of the people rooted in trust, relationship, and collective wisdom has eroded in measurable and visible ways.

The report took it further, pointing to a quiet but powerful sign of our social unraveling: far more Americans are eating alone today than ever before. Nearly [three out of every four restaurant orders](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2025/02/american-loneliness-personality-politics/681091/) in the US are for takeout, delivery, drive-thru, or curbside pickup. **Well-being among under-30s in the US has [declined far more rapidly than older generations](https://www.theguardian.com/society/2024/mar/20/young-people-becoming-less-happy-than-older-generations-research-shows), while solo dining [increased by 80%](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/20/us/americans-solo-dining-happiness.html) among American adults under 25.** Entertainment and food have always served as powerful rituals for bringing people together. Shared meals, gathering spaces, and the civic commons aren't just relics of a bygone era-they are how we build trust, and how we find belonging with each other. Now, more often than not, these age-old rituals are being replaced with activities done in isolation-often behind a screen. *A baby starved of social contact has difficulty developing a regulated nervous system. Young men with few social acquaintances develop high adrenaline levels. Lonely students have low levels of immune cells. Prison inmates prefer violence to solitary confinement.

Solo Dining May Be a Sign](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/20/us/americans-solo-dining-happiness.html).\" *New York Times* **In our recent [31-min mini-documentary on transforming media polarization](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cia4mv0QyMk), we discuss how the real threat isn't each other-it's the engineered media narratives that are fragmenting our sense of reality and driving us apart.** These manipulative narratives exploit something deeply human: our evolutionary wiring to protect ourselves and our community from danger. Today's media machine hijacks these survival instincts, flooding us with an endless barrage of character attacks and smears, existential worst-case scenarios, distorted fear-based narratives, and who's to blame. The more we live in fear and division, the more disconnected and disempowered we become. *In 2023, [US Surgeon General] Vivek Murthy ... published an 81-page warning about America's \"epidemic of loneliness,\" claiming that its negative health effects were on par with those of tobacco use and obesity. **A growing number of public-health officials seem to regard loneliness as the developed world's next critical public-health issue.** The United Kingdom now has a minister for loneliness. So does Japan.* Richard V. Reeves, the president of the [American Institute for Boys and Men](https://aibm.org/), told me that for men, as for women, something hard to define is lost when we pursue a life of isolationist comforts. He calls it \"neededness\"-the way we make ourselves essential to our families and community. \"I think at some level, **we all need to feel like we're a jigsaw piece that's going to fit into a jigsaw somewhere.\"** Today's young men do not seem to be constructing these relationships in the same way that they used to. In place of neededness, despair is creeping in. **Feeling unneeded \"is actually, in some cases, literally fatal,\" Reeves said. \"If you look at the words that men use to describe themselves before they take their own lives, they are worthless and useless.\"** Since 2001, hundreds of thousands of men have died of drug overdoses. These drugs, he emphasized, are defined by their solitary nature: Opioids are not party drugs, but rather the opposite. -\"[The Anti-Social Century](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2025/02/american-loneliness-personality-politics/681091/),\" *The Atlantic* Cognitive scientist and psychologist Dr. John Vervaeke calls this", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:inspiration__lonely-world-failing-systems-what-sustains-us.txt:1:b445aa5f4796", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 11946, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "inspiration__lonely-world-failing-systems-what-sustains-us.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "inspiration__lonely-world-failing-systems-what-sustains-us", "chunk_index": 2, "text": "in. **Feeling unneeded \"is actually, in some cases, literally fatal,\" Reeves said. \"If you look at the words that men use to describe themselves before they take their own lives, they are worthless and useless.\"** Since 2001, hundreds of thousands of men have died of drug overdoses.

Yet even in the face of this grim reality, the longing remains to be part of something real. To create something more human than the systems unraveling around us. **How do we create the cultural and social conditions that bring out the best in each other? How do we find our way back to the kind of democracy that lives not just in institutions, but in how we treat one another?** Across ideological lines and in everyday life, people all over the world are cultivating abundance, security, and safety with one another. This matters now more than ever, because the future is not guaranteed to be stable. The more united and grounded we are in real relationship, the harder it becomes for the powers that be to manipulate us, polarize us, or pit us against one another. Dr. Andreas Heisler, president of Swiss-based independent medical and health network ALETHEIA, said it best: \"**The currency of the future will be relationships of trust.\"** Trust isn't built on political ideologies or some fixed set of \"agreed-upon facts.\" Real trust grows from something deeper: the values and practices that bind us in relationship-mutual care, shared responsibility, and the belief that we're better off when we look out for one another. At their core, true democratic values go beyond partisanship. They express themselves through common welfare, and the everyday ways we help each other survive, heal, and thrive. *When one lives in a society where people can no longer rely on the institutions to tell them the truth, the truth must come from culture and art.* -John Trudell, Native American poet, activist, and musician **Below are some of the most powerful, grounded alternatives to the loneliness and economic instability we face.

Leafy rows of basil, sweet potatoes and mesclun spring from raised garden troughs. Most striking are corridors of elevated planters stacked four high, like multilevel bunk beds, filled with kale, cabbage, arugula, various lettuces, eggplants, tatsoi and collard greens. **Run by a gardening wizard named Jamiah Hargins, this wee farm in the front yard of his bungalow provides fresh produce for 45 nearby families, all while using a tiny fraction of the water required by a lawn**.

In a promising experiment in an affluent swath of the borough, dozens of solar-panel arrays spread across rowhouse rooftops are wired into a growing network. Called the Brooklyn Microgrid, the project is signing up residents and businesses to a virtual trading platform that will allow solar-energy producers to sell excess-electricity credits from their systems to buyers in the group, who may live as close as next door. The project is still in its early stages - it has just 50 participants thus far - but its implications could be far reaching. The idea is to create a kind of virtual, peer-to-peer energy trading system [built on blockchain](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/04/business/dealbook/blockchain-ibm-bitcoin.html), the database technology that underlies cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. **The ability to complete secure transactions and create a business based on energy sharing would allow participants to bypass the electric company energy supply and ultimately build a microgrid with energy generation and storage components that could function on their own, even during broad power failure**s. \"The long-term goal is to be at least partially independent of the grid in emergencies, which was a reasonable argument to join,\" said Patrick Schnell, whose Gowanus basement flooded during Hurricane Sandy in 2012. \"Hopefully it will expand and more people will join and it will be more worthwhile.\" **Note:** Explore more positive stories like this in on [technology for good](https://wanttoknow.info/tech-for-goodmediaarticles). **Digital Justice: Internet Co-ops Resist Net Neutrality Rollbacks** **October 2, 2018, Project Censored** [https://www.projectcensored.org/15-digital-justice...](https://www.projectcensored.org/15-digital-justice-internet-co-ops-resist-net-neutrality-rollbacks/) More than 300 electric cooperatives across the United States are building their own Internet with high-speed fiber networks.

Detroit residents started a grassroots movement called the Equitable Internet Initiative, through which locals have begun to build their own high-speed Internet**. The initiative started by enlisting digital stewards-locals who were interested in working for the nonprofit coalition. They aim to build shared tools, like a forum and a secured emergency communication network-and to educate their communities on digital literacy. Just 30 of the more than 300 tribal reservations in the United States have Internet access. Seventeen tribal reservation communities in San Diego County have secured wireless Internet access under the Tribal Digital Village initiative. Another local effort, Co-Mo Electric Cooperative ... has organized to crowdfund the necessary resources to establish its own network. The biggest dilemma for cities is the erosion of the capacity for communities to solve their own problems.

There are probably more than 40,000 members in over 500 time banks in the US. Many time banks are volunteer community projects, but the one in Sebastopol, [CA] is funded by the city. \"Every volunteer hour is valued around $29,\" Wyatt calculates. \"Now think about the thousands of dollars a city saves when hundreds of citizens serve their community for free.\" The Sebastopol time bank has banked more than 8,000 hours since its launch in 2016.

When a household item - a clock, a vacuum cleaner, a chair - broke, people used to try to fix it. Now, their first impulse was to throw it away. As a writer focused on sustainability issues, she was disturbed by that. She came up with a solution that led to a career change and inspired an international grass-roots movement: a regular gathering at which people with broken items can bring them to a place where other people can try to fix them. In 2009, she did a trial run in Amsterdam - and it drew many more people than she expected. Word spread, and soon a network of what became known as [Repair Cafés](https://repaircafe.org/en/) began to spread across the Netherlands and beyond. Turning her attention to it full time, Postma started the Repair Café International Foundation. She wrote a manual on how to organize the cafes and put together a starter kit. There are now nearly 1,700 cafes in 35 countries, including 75 in the United States, 30 in Canada and 450 in the Netherlands. **The repairs do more than extend the life of the items: They also create community. \"You get to know your neighbors, to see that the person you pass on the street that you never talk to has some valuable knowledge and is not just a strange old guy**,\" Postma said. Repairers tend to skew older ... but Postma, 48, is trying to contact younger generations and has started holding demonstrations at schools. **Note:** Watch a [two-minute video](https://www.karmatube.org/videos.php?id=7430) on this wonderful project.

The increase in bartering is nowhere better exemplified than in Fiji. The country has a long tradition of barter, known as 'veisa'** ... and Fijians have harnessed modern technology to connect even more people. \"I knew that money would be tight to stretch out and even harder to come by. I asked myself what happens when there's no more money? Barter was a natural solution to that,\" says Marlene Dutta, who started the Barter for a Better Fiji group on 21 April. Its membership is just under 190,000 - more than 20% of Fiji's population. Items changing hands have run the gamut - pigs for kayaks, a violin for a leather satchel and doughnuts for building bricks - but the most commonly requested items have been groceries and food. Bartering isn't just for individuals looking for baking items or help with grocery shopping, however. Businesses are increasingly interested in joining barter exchanges, which have \"doctors, lawyers, service companies, retailers - you name it\", says Ron Whitney, President of the US-based International Reciprocal Trade Association, a non-profit organisation founded in 1979 that promotes and advances modern trade and barter systems. **Note:** Explore more positive stories like this in our comprehensive [inspiring news articles archive](https://www.wanttoknow.info/inspirationalnewsarticles) focused on solutions and bridging divides. **The Towns That Invent Their Own Money** **March 24, 2025, *Reasons to be Cheerful*** [https://reasonstobecheerful.world/towns-invent-community-currencies/](https://reasonstobecheerful.world/towns-invent-community-currencies/) Community currencies - alternative forms of money sometimes also referred to as local or regional currencies - are as diverse as the communities they serve, from grassroots [time-banking and mutual credit](https://reasonstobecheerful.world/time-banks-valuable-currency-aging-communities/) schemes to blockchain-based [Community Inclusion Currencies](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJL9-FFleow).

Borrowing from a Depression-era idea, they are aiming to help consumers make ends meet and support struggling local businesses. **Businesses and individuals form a network to print currency.

In my previous work as the restorative justice and wellness coordinator for a public high school, I was deeply humbled by my efforts to help transform unjust and dysfunctional systems eroding the health of our educational institutions and communities. Going deeper, I've witnessed profound transformations in the troubled youth I served, as well as in the families, teachers, administrators, and police officers I closely worked with. Despite the great challenges, love and human goodness continued to show up powerfully, revealing itself in the form of community and meaningful relationships being built across differences. **Martin Luther King Jr. felt that cultivating a vision of love in the midst of injustice and community conflict was a moral imperative.** Beyond boldly shaping the U.S. civil rights movement, he was also a courageous voice in speaking out about the growing concerns of the U.S. military industrial complex during the Vietnam War. He identified the Greek word *agape* as a form of love that is key to the human experience. Instead of it meaning something sentimental or affectionate, **agape is the understanding, redeeming goodwill for all. **Furthermore, agape is the willingness to go to any length to restore community. This includes the people we deem as enemies and oppressors, whose actions dehumanize and detract from society. **Below is a personal story that speaks to what love in action like this can look like. **May we remember the simple power of telling a story, letting it inform us of what it means to be human and what connects us across our (often) vast differences. As medical doctor Rachel Remen shares, \"*Everybody is a story. Telling stories is the way the wisdom gets passed along. The stuff that helps us to live a life worth remembering. Despite the awesome powers of technology, many of us still do not live very well. We may need to listen to each other's stories once again.\"* With faith in a transforming world, [Amber Yang](https://www.amberyang.love/) for [PEERS](https://www.peerservice.org) and [WantToKnow.info](https://www.wanttoknow.info) *Your task is not to seek for love, but merely to seek and find all the barriers within yourself that you have built against it.* - Rumi He was fifteen years old when I first met him.

Teachers were terrified to be near him, and even his special education case manager had given up on him, expediting the expulsion process just to get him out of his hair. What most people saw was a kid who drank and smoked cannabis all the time, got into countless fights with sharp knives, and aggressively confronted any adult who got in his way. In the beginning, I was no exception to his distrust in authority. But I kept showing up, talking to him in the hallways when he was actually at school. Eventually, I began calling him into my classroom where we slowly got to know each other over the course of several months. I showed him I wasn't afraid of who he was. Over time, I learned that he got into fights because kids would make fun of his older brother, who was born with serious birth defects and cognitive impairments due to his mother's opioid use during pregnancy. I learned that he was 7 years old when he witnessed both of his uncles get shot in the car, dying right in front of him, while he hid in the backseat. I learned that much of his anger came from watching his father get drunk and beat his mother endlessly almost every night. I learned that he witnessed his brother attempting to end his own life many times, and would drive him to the hospital without a driving permit, after experiencing too many times where ambulances failed to show up in a timely manner. At one point, I invited the young man into a circle I held for boys impacted by the juvenile hall system. I was surprised when he showed up later that week, standing at the doorway for the first few circles. The next time, he sat in a chair and joined the circle, refusing to make eye contact. That session, I asked each of us to speak to this question: **What was something you wish people you love would say to you? **I still vividly remember the responses as if it happened yesterday. \"I forgive you.\" \"I'm here.

He balled up his fists, knees bobbing up and down, feeling the discomfort of the vulnerability that he brought into the circle. *The greatest thing you'll ever learn, is just to love and be loved in return.*\" - \"Nature Boy,\" Nat King Cole Many of us don't know the difference between approval and real love. Our family, cultural, and institutional systems teach us to fit into boxes and suppress our own needs to be accepted. Going deeper, most of us find that it's rare to have a person in our life that truly sees and accepts us as we are, including our mistakes, imperfections, blind spots, and limits. Yet this is exactly what it takes for us to heal, and to bloom in our own radiance. The more we learn how to give this unconditional love to ourselves, the more we attract people who can reflect this back to us. *You know, a lot of people don't love themselves. And they go through life with deep and haunting emotional conflicts. So the length of life means that you must love yourself. And you know what loving yourself also means? It means that you've got to accept yourself.* - Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., \"The Three Dimensions of a Complete Life\" Sermon The Dalai Lama once said that love is the absence of judgment. I would modify that slightly, and say that ***love is the suspension of judgment*.** It's deeply human to judge. Judgment is rooted in our survival, our ability to sense threats and possible harm. Yet judging is how most of us solely relate to ourselves, each other, and the world. They're usually based off of unchecked assumptions and projections that reveal more of who we are. Love transcends the judgments of differences within ourselves or others, making room for managing those differences with understanding and open communication. *I want there to be a place in the world where people can engage in one another's differences in a way that is redemptive, full of hope and possibility. Not this \"In order to love you, I must make you something else\".

Turning to each boy, I said their chosen words out loud to them. For 30 seconds before moving onto the next person, all of us would meditate quietly for this boy, wishing him the strength and courage needed for him to believe those words. By the end of the circle, most of us were in tears, silently processing the whole experience. The energy in the room was palpable. **This was a deeply significant moment, as many of these boys couldn't stand to be in the same room with each other at one point, caught up in judgments showing up as gang affiliation and racial pride, but deeply rooted in traumatic childhood experiences and unhealthy beliefs about masculinity. ** At the end of the school year, the young boy that I closely worked with worked his way up to B's and C's, and had a 90% attendance rate. He stopped doing drugs, got a job, and used his paycheck to buy new clothes and level up his fashion style. He was laughing more. He played basketball with other kids from the school. Teachers were shocked by how different his energy was, and how smart he actually was. While a part of me rejects the notion that people are considered successful just by measuring the grades they get or the clothes they wear, his behavior and choices showed that he was gaining self-confidence. For the first time in his life, he began to care about his life. He started to trust his own humanity. *One moment of unconditional love can invalidate an entire lifetime of uncertainty and doubt.* -Rachel Remen Rachel Naomi Remen, a medical doctor who advocates for humanizing and recovering the sacred in medicine, once said that the heart is an organ of vision, a way of seeing and knowing.

We learn love through the ways in which we were cared for (or not) growing up. In my own abusive childhood, I developed my own version of seeing love and vulnerability as a painful experience, inseparable from shame, drama and violence. As poet and historian Aurora Levins Morales puts it, *\"We are a society of people living in a state of post-traumatic shock.*\" A society in which toxic social conditions produce internalized experiences of powerlessness and fear, which cause people to turn to systems of violence and domination for self-protection. This isn't just for the troubled kids I worked with, or those impacted by socio-economic disparities. **Trauma plays a role in how human rights abuses and covert corruption can even occur at the hands of special interests within our own government and corporate systems. **As [ponerology studies](https://lust-for-life.org/Lust-For-Life/_Textual/AndrewMLobaczewski_PoliticalPonerology_RedHillPress1998_330pp/AndrewMLobaczewski_PoliticalPonerology_RedHillPress1998_330pp.pdf) reveal, a small percentage of our society are sociopathic, and they often rise to power and engage in abusive deeds that we \"normals\" can't even begin to fathom... to the extent that we remain unaware of the very real existences of these atrocities. **Most, if not all, of these sociopaths came from households devoid of real love or a secure attachment.** Thus, their lives are spent organizing around what they've learned: abusive power and control. **For Martin Luther King Jr., love constituted a kind of power, the power that is adequate to the task of overcoming cycles of injustice and oppression. **If the right conditions of community and love emerge like they did with these young boys in the circle, this inspires us to take responsibility for our lives, awakening to the greatest challenges in our lives as we work to", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:inspiration__love-in-action-inspiring-story.txt:4:1aa2de0f1bfe", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 11964, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "inspiration__love-in-action-inspiring-story.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "inspiration__love-in-action-inspiring-story", "chunk_index": 5, "text": "Thus, their lives are spent organizing around what they've learned: abusive power and control. **For Martin Luther King Jr., love constituted a kind of power, the power that is adequate to the task of overcoming cycles of injustice and oppression. **If the right conditions of community and love emerge like they did with these young boys in the circle, this inspires us to take responsibility for our lives, awakening to the greatest challenges in our lives as we work to transform humanity's great challenges. **Love is an end in itself, as well as a means to good ends.** Centering an ethic of love with what we do in the world reminds us of what is most important, and what is possible... beyond solely focusing on what's going wrong in the world.

Acquafondata ** In the landmark book *[The Soul of Money](http://www.amazon.com/Soul-Money-Reclaiming-Wealth-Resources/dp/039332950X/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1/105-8477226-4271649?tag=wanttinfo-20&ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1189020864&sr=1-1)*, author Lynne Twist powerfully inspires each of us to learn how to speak with our money. In this book, Lynne writes about an experience she had as a fund raiser for the Hunger Project. One day she met a corporate executive in his high rise office in Chicago. All she knew about the huge food corporation for which he functioned as CEO was that it had recently suffered a major image problem due to inappropriate actions. **The corporation apparently had decided upon the idea of contributing to a cause aimed at ending world hunger as a way to \"clean up its image.\" ** She wrote: \"I was ushered into the CEO's office. There he sat at his desk, and I sat facing him on the other side. The backlighting made it so that I could barely see his face. I only had fifteen minutes of his time, so I spoke quickly about the mission and work of our organization and the challenges of ending world hunger. \"I talked about the courage of the hungry people and the partnership that we all needed to provide them in their courageous commitment to feed themselves and their children and build the conditions for a healthy and productive life. **When I was done and had made my request, he opened his desk drawer and pulled out a preprinted check for $50,000 and passed it across the desk to me.** \"It was clear that he wanted me gone as quickly as possible.

The perfunctory presentation and the tone of his voice told me that he had no genuine interest in our work, in connecting with resource-poor people or in making any kind of a difference in the work to end world hunger. \"This was purely a strategic move. He wanted to off-load the guilt and shame from public mistakes the company had made. And he wanted to have the company look good in the media. \"In financial terms, it was to be a simple transaction. Handing me this check for $50,000 bought his company an opportunity to mend its reputation. But as he slid the check over to me, I felt the guilt of the company coming right across that desk with the money. He gave me the money and the company's guilt\" [[1]](#_edn1) **This was the largest check Lynne had ever received in her work as a fund raiser. Yet rather than feeling elated, it left her feeling empty and hollow. ** Immediately after that unusual meeting, Lynne flew to New York City. Here is the unexpected awakening she experienced there in her own words: \"I arrived in New York in the middle of a rainstorm and made my way to Harlem, to an old church building. I walked down the steps to the basement room where about seventy-five people had gathered for the fund-raising event. \"The surroundings couldn't have been more different from the penthouse office that I had left only a few hours before. It was raining, and there were leaks all over the room where we were meeting. Buckets were strategically placed all around the outer walls catching the dripping water. **\"I looked out at the audience, and I knew that the people sitting there did not have much money to give.** I spoke to them about The Hunger Project's commitment to Africa, as I thought it would be the most relevant to their own lives and their heritage. When it came time to ask for donations, my palms were sweating. I began to wonder if it was the right thing to do. I went ahead and made the request. \"The room fell absolutely silent. \"After what seemed like a long silent pause, a woman stood up. She was sitting on the aisle in a row near the back. She was in her late sixties or early seventies. She had gray hair parted down the middle and swept up into a tidy bun. When she stood up, she was tall, slender, erect, and proud. \"Girl,\" she", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:inspiration__money-matters-soul-of-money.txt:1:a37ffc230ab9", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 11974, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "inspiration__money-matters-soul-of-money.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "inspiration__money-matters-soul-of-money", "chunk_index": 2, "text": "it was the right thing to do. I went ahead and made the request. \"The room fell absolutely silent. \"After what seemed like a long silent pause, a woman stood up. She was sitting on the aisle in a row near the back. She was in her late sixties or early seventies. She had gray hair parted down the middle and swept up into a tidy bun. When she stood up, she was tall, slender, erect, and proud. \"Girl,\" she started, \"my name is Gertrude, and I like what you've said, and I like you. Now, I ain't got no checkbook, and I ain't got no credit cards,\" she continued. \"To me, money is a lot like water. For some folks, it rushes through their life like a raging river. For me, money comes through my life like a little trickle. But I want to pass it on in a way that does the most good for the most folks. I see that as my right and as my responsibility. It's also my joy. **I have fifty dollars in my purse that I earned from doing a white woman's wash, and I want to give it to you.\"** \"She walked up the aisle and handed me her fifty dollars. It was in one-dollar, five-dollar, and ten-dollar bills. Then she gave me a big hug. As she headed back to her seat, other people, inspired by Gertrude's words, started coming up and making their own contributions in singles, five, ten, and twenty-dollar bills. I was so moved that I found myself crying. I couldn't hold all the bills in my hands, so at one point, I opened my briefcase and put it on the table to act as a kind of basket for the money. \"These moments, with people streaming up to give their money, had the feeling of a sacred ceremony. There was a deep sense of integrity and heart. **The amount of money that we received - maybe $500 at the most - was more precious to me than any gift I'd ever received before. ** \"As I packed up getting ready to leave, I realized that at the bottom of that same briefcase, underneath all these bills, was the $50,000 check I had been given earlier that same day. As I saw it, I also realized that Gertrude's fifty dollars felt more valuable to me and ultimately would do more to end hunger than the check for an amount one hundred times more. \"The money I received from Gertrude carried the energy of her commitment to make a difference - the stamp of her soul. As I accepted the money from her, I felt inspired and renewed by her sincere expression of integrity and purpose. I felt my organization's principles and programs affirmed, not only by her fifty dollars, but also by her contributions of spirit.\" [[2]](#_edn2) This", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:inspiration__money-matters-soul-of-money.txt:2:af3efc04aa81", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 11975, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "inspiration__money-matters-soul-of-money.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "inspiration__money-matters-soul-of-money", "chunk_index": 3, "text": "do more to end hunger than the check for an amount one hundred times more. \"The money I received from Gertrude carried the energy of her commitment to make a difference - the stamp of her soul.

I felt my organization's principles and programs affirmed, not only by her fifty dollars, but also by her contributions of spirit.\" [[2]](#_edn2) This moving encounter started shifting something in Lynne's mind and heart. It gave her a newfound courage and determination. **The next day she sent a letter returning the $50,000 check to the Chicago CEO** with a note thanking him for his consideration. In this unusual note, she suggested that he choose an organization to which the company felt truly committed. Years later, Lynne had all but forgotten the returned check when she received a letter from that same executive. In this powerful letter, he shared how the single action of that returned check had made a huge difference in his life. Here's what Lynne says about it: \"Upon retiring, he had looked back on his long and fruitful career, and one thing that stood out for him was our interaction and the return of that $50,000 check, with the note explaining that we were looking for committed partners. It was for him as a seminal moment when all the rules of corporate America that he had so deeply learned - that you do anything and everything to increase profits - all those rules had been shattered by someone outside his world returning the company's money. \"Reflecting from retirement on meaningful moments, he realized that he did, in fact, want to make a difference in ending world hunger. He did want the money under his control to make a difference. And he could see now that it was possible to make a meaningful contribution to end world hunger. **So from his own pocket, and in affirmation of his own commitment, he made a contribution to The Hunger Project many times in excess of the $50,000 that had been returned.\"** [[3]](#_edn3) So, if you are going to give a $50,000 donation, do it with gusto and conviction or, you never know, the recipient might just return it. And if like me, you don't have that kind of money, give what you can with enthusiasm and conviction. Know that how you give matters. **Muhammad Yunus** Another amazing human being inspired me deeply on transforming my perceptions around money. As I learned more about this man, Muhammad Yunus, a few words stood out that sum up his philosophy. He said, \"We achieve what we want to achieve. If we are not achieving something, my first suspicion will fall on the intensity of our desire to achieve it.\" [[4]](#_edn4) His words got me thinking.

If we are not achieving something, my first suspicion will fall on the intensity of our desire to achieve it.\" [[4]](#_edn4) His words got me thinking. What do I want to achieve? Not in terms of personal gain, but in terms of what I would like to be a part of changing in this world. How would I like the world to be a better place? There are so many worthy goals. It's easy to get overwhelmed with choices or to get torn in so many directions that one's efforts are totally diluted. What can I get energized around to the point that I have an intensity of commitment? Then how can I use my money to further that goal or goals? How might my deeper values inform those decisions? **Bangladesh in 1974. Thousands of people died. At the time Muhammad Yunus was a young professor teaching economics at Chittagong University. At the time, Yunus wrote, \"People were dying on the street. We could see human bodies like skeletons, walking like zombies, lying on the street.\" [[5]](#_edn5) ** \"Nothing in the economic theories I taught reflected the life around me. How could I go on telling my students make believe stories in the name of economics? I needed to run away from these theories and from my textbooks and discover the real-life economics of a poor person's existence.\" [[6]](#_edn6) Yunus could no longer follow his original life plan. He stopped teaching economics and began to focus on the goal of finding an economic solution to poverty. He experimented with a variety of approaches, until in 1976 one unusual attempt succeeded. In that year, Yunus met a 21-year-old woman, Sufia Begum, who had to borrow money to buy bamboo to make stools. She earned 25 cents a day, yet after paying off the high interest on her debt from borrowing fees, she ended up taking home only two cents a day. She could barely feed herself. **Yunus' solution focused on trust and community. He trusted Sufia and took a risk by lending $27 of his own money.** He didn't lend the money just to her though, and that fact is a crucial part of his later success. He lent the money at low interest collectively to both Sufia and her neighbors, who shared her trade. He asked the group to pay it back over the course of the next year. His plan worked. He found that lending the money and dividing it among a small group made a difference in the success. Next, he agreed to serve as a", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:inspiration__money-matters-soul-of-money.txt:4:1ccecc535802", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 11977, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "inspiration__money-matters-soul-of-money.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "inspiration__money-matters-soul-of-money", "chunk_index": 5, "text": "lend the money just to her though, and that fact is a crucial part of his later success. He lent the money at low interest collectively to both Sufia and her neighbors, who shared her trade. He asked the group to pay it back over the course of the next year. His plan worked. He found that lending the money and dividing it among a small group made a difference in the success. Next, he agreed to serve as a guarantor on a larger loan from a traditional bank. This worked for a while, but **before long, he got fed up with the traditional banking system. He then developed the inspiring [Grameen Bank](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grameen_Bank). This unusual new bank was based on the principle of trust and focusing on small communities of people who share a commitment to help each other.** The system includes a willingness to take risks and a commitment to human rights. The now world-renowned Grameen Bank uses methods that are pretty much the opposite of conventional banking. For example: Conventional banking operates on the principle that the more you have, the more we will lend you. The poor are rarely given loans at all. Grameen Bank believes credit should be a human right. It lends money to those who posses nothing, but have potential to earn. Conventional banks are owned by rich people, mostly men. Poor women own Grameen Bank. Conventional banking is based on collateral. Grameen is based on trust. **Grameen does not lend to individuals, but to groups of people who are then responsible to each other.** New loans are available only after previous loans have been paid off. Conventional banks punish people who can't pay loans. Grameen bank helps borrowers with legitimate problems to reschedule loans. Conventional banks require lots of paperwork. Grameen lends money to illiterate people. Muhammad Yunus once set out to end poverty. He came up with an inspired idea and created a vast possibility where once there was none. **The Grameen Bank now has 6.6 million borrowers from around the globe who are pulling themselves out of poverty. Many can now afford to feed their families three good meals a day and pay the small government fees required to send their children to schools. ** The Nobel Committee acknowledged the pioneering efforts of Yunus for working toward world peace, because they believe that we can't have peace until we find ways to get people out of poverty. Yunus and the Grameen Bank were [awarded the Nobel Peace Prize](https://www.WantToKnow.info/a-nobel-winner-urges-defeat-poverty) in 2006. Yunus used basic, loving human values and creativity to speak with his money. His message carried far beyond his original dreams, opening a world of possibility. He once wrote: \"Grameen has taught me two things: first our knowledge base about people and their interactions is still very inadequate; second, each individual person is very important. Each person has tremendous potential. She", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:inspiration__money-matters-soul-of-money.txt:5:ea4f66c6a328", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 11978, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "inspiration__money-matters-soul-of-money.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "inspiration__money-matters-soul-of-money", "chunk_index": 6, "text": "to get people out of poverty.

He once wrote: \"Grameen has taught me two things: first our knowledge base about people and their interactions is still very inadequate; second, each individual person is very important. Each person has tremendous potential. She alone can influence the lives of others within communities [and] nations - within and beyond her own time. \"Each of us has much more hidden inside of us than what we have had a chance to explore so far. Unless we create [an] enabling environment to discover the limits of our potential, we will never know what we have inside of us. **Grameen has given me a faith, an unshakable faith in the creativity of human beings.** That leads me to believe that human beings are not born to suffer the misery of hunger and poverty. They suffer now and did in the past because we turn our mind away from the issue.\" [[7]](#_edn7) Reading this I thought, how could Yunus' approach to speaking with his money apply to us? When he said, \"We achieve what we want to achieve,\" he used a communal \"we.\" Ultimately it took a community of poor people working together to help each other. In our individualistic society we tend to ask the question, \"How can I make a difference? How would I like the world to change? What can I do?\" I suggest we look for a community perspective. The fact that you are [reading this] now indicates that you have at least a sense of the importance of community, maybe a deep commitment to it. We speak about our belief in the worth and value of every human being. We don't exclude people who we don't understand or who might seem very different from us. We stand for human rights and for peace and for the freedom to speak our conscience, even when others disagree. We celebrate many paths along the journey of life, and we learn from the diversity. We treasure the natural world, and we grapple with the responsibility of interdependence. It takes money to do this. I know that. I want to do my part. When I'm generous in my giving and my attitude, it opens my heart. **There are definitely people who struggle, but the majority of us, myself included, have plenty of money in comparison to the majority of people around the world. ** We all make choices.

To make sure that I am doing some good with my money, I set aside a certain percentage of my income every year to give away before I spend money on other things. For me that percentage is six. Other percentages might make sense for families in different circumstances. This method helps me to be disciplined in giving and make more generous choices. What about you? Are you up to the challenge? **How will you speak with your money in a way that transforms our world? ** **Footnotes** [[1]](#_ednref1) *The Soul of Money* by Lynne Twist, pp. 98-99 [[2]](#_ednref2) *The Soul of Money* by Lynne Twist, p. 100 [[3]](#_ednref3) *The Soul of Money* by Lynne Twist. p. 118 [[4]](#_ednref4) \"Overcoming Poverty through Entrepreneurial Empowerment\" by Muhammad Yunus, 1995 Max Schmidheiny Foundation at the University of St. Gallen.

My husband rushed me to hospital. After doing scans, they diagnosed me with grade 4B lymphoma (the highest grade). The senior oncologist looked at my report and told my husband that it was too late, that my organs were now shutting down. I only had 36 hours to live. The oncologist said he would do whatever he could, but prepared my husband that I would most likely not make it, as my organs were no longer functioning. They started me on a chemotherapy drip as well as oxygen. Then they started to take tests to determine what drugs to use. I was drifting in and out of consciousness during this time. I could feel my spirit actually leaving my body. I saw and heard the conversations between my husband and the doctors taking place outside my room, about 40 feet away down a hallway. I was later able to verify this conversation with my shocked husband. **Then I actually \"crossed over\" to another dimension. I was engulfed in a total feeling of love. I also experienced extreme clarity of why I had the cancer, why I had come into this life in the first place, what role everyone in my family played in my life in the grand scheme of things, and how life works in general. ** The clarity and understanding I obtained in this state is almost indescribable. Words cannot describe the experience. I was at a place where I understood how much more there is than what we are able to conceive in our three-dimensional world. I realized what a gift life is, and that I was surrounded by loving spiritual beings, who were", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:inspiration__near_death_story_inspiring.txt:0:47955af2b924", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 11982, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "inspiration__near_death_story_inspiring.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "inspiration__near_death_story_inspiring", "chunk_index": 1, "text": "everyone in my family played in my life in the grand scheme of things, and how life works in general. ** The clarity and understanding I obtained in this state is almost indescribable.

I realized what a gift life is, and that I was surrounded by loving spiritual beings, who were always around me even when I did not know it. The amount of love I felt was overwhelming. From this perspective, I knew how powerful I am and saw the amazing possibilities we as humans are capable of achieving during a physical life. I found out that if I survived, my purpose now would be to live \"heaven on earth\" using this new understanding, and also to share this knowledge with other people. However I had the choice of whether to come back into life, or go towards death. I was made to understand that it was not my time, but I always had the choice. And if I chose death, I would not be experiencing a lot of the gifts that the rest of my life still held in store. One of the things I wanted to know was that if I chose life, would I have to come back to this sick body, because my body was very, very sick and the organs had stopped functioning. I was then made to understand that if I chose life, my body would heal very quickly. I would see a difference in not months or weeks, but days! **I was shown how illnesses start on an energetic level before they become physical. If I chose to go into life, the cancer would be gone from my energy, and my physical body would catch up very quickly. I then understood that when people have medical treatments for illnesses, it rids the illness only from their body but not from their energy, so the illness often returns. ** I realized if I went back, I would return with a very healthy energy. My physical body would catch up to the energetic conditions very quickly and permanently. I was given the understanding that this applies to anything, not only illnesses, but physical conditions, psychological conditions, etc. I was \"shown\" that everything going on in our lives is dependant on this energy around us, created by us. Nothing is solid. We create our surroundings, our conditions, etc. depending on where this \"energy\" is at. The clarity I received around how we get what we do was phenomenal! It's all about where we are energetically. I was made to feel that I was going to see \"proof\" of this first hand if I returned back to my body.

It's all about where we are energetically. I was made to feel that I was going to see \"proof\" of this first hand if I returned back to my body. I was drifting in and out between the two worlds. Every time I drifted into the \"other side\", I was shown more and more scenes. There was one which showed how my life had touched all the people I had come in contact with. It was sort of like a tapestry and showed how I affected everyone's lives around me. There was another which showed my brother on a plane, having heard the news I was dying, coming to see me (this was later verified to me, as when I started to come round, my brother was there having just got off a plane). I then saw a glimpse of my brother and me and somehow seemed to understand it was a previous life, where I was much older than him and was like a mother to him (in this life, he is older than me). I saw in that life I was very protective towards him. I suddenly became aware he was on the plane to come and see me, and felt \"I can't do this to him. I can't let him come and see me dead\". Then I also saw how my husband's purpose was linked to mine, and how we had decided to come and experience this life together. If I went, he would probably follow soon after. **I was made to understand - as tests had been taken for my organ functions and the results were not out yet - that if I chose life, the results would show that my organs were functioning normally.

As I started to wake up (in a very confused state, as I could not at that time tell which side of the veil I was on), the doctors came rushing into the room with big smiles on their faces saying to my family, \"Good news! We got the results and her organs are functioning. We can't believe it!! Her body really did seem like it had shut down!\" After that, I began to recover rapidly.

The doctors waited for me to become stable enough to do a lymph node biopsy to track the type of cancer cells. Once completed, they could not find a single lymph node big enough to suggest cancer. Yet upon entering the hospital my body had been filled with swollen lymph nodes. They then did a bone marrow biopsy to assess the cancer activity so that they could adjust the chemotherapy according to the disease. Yet there wasn't any cancer in the bone marrow. The doctors were very confused, but told me it must have been a rapid response to the chemo. Because they themselves were unable to understand what was going on, they made me undergo test after test, all of which I passed with flying colors. Clearing every test empowered me even more! I had a full body scan, and because they couldn't believe they didn't find anything, they made the radiologist repeat it again!!!! **Because of my experience, I am now sharing with everyone I know that miracles are possible in our lives every day. After what I have seen, I realize that absolutely anything is possible, and that we did not come here to suffer. Life is supposed to be great, and we are very, very loved. The way I look at life has changed dramatically. I am so glad to have been given a second chance to experience \"heaven on earth\".** **Note:** Anita's miraculous near-death story has been read and appreciated by millions from around the globe.

The below comparison is an attempt to capture the spirit of the old and new paradigm without the intention of making one better than the other, yet also inviting us to join in welcoming inspiring new ways which can support us all in being the best we can be and making a difference in our lives and world. **New Paradigm Comparisons** **Old:** Man is born into sin, essentially corrupt at the core. **New:** All people in their core essence are beautiful and [worthy of love](https://www.momentoflove.org/). **Old:** Hatred and vengeance are justified for wrongs suffered.

Create a convincing persona to present to the world. **New:** Welcome [authenticity and vulnerability](https://www.weboflove.org/keystolife#acceptance). It's all about being honest and real with each other. **Old:** Emphasis on hierarchies. Focus on competition so that the best rise to the top of the hierarchy. **New:** [Emphasis on equality](https://www.WantToKnow.info/consciousnessparadigms#hierarchy). Focus on cooperation in order to support the greatest good for all. **Old:** Avoid personal responsibility by blaming those above or below in the hierarchy. **New:** [Take personal responsibility](https://www.momentoflove.org/g/victim_or_creator_vs) for actions and learn from our mistakes. **Old:** People need to be led or controlled by those believed to be better or more capable. **New:** Each individual is a [powerful creator](https://www.momentoflove.org/g/victim_or_creator_vs#transform) capable of meeting their needs with the help of others. **Old:** The mind and science are supreme. The scientific paradigm supersedes God and religion. **New:** The heart and personal relationships are of paramount importance.

[Flexible guidelines and beliefs](https://www.weboflove.org/wingmakers#beliefs). We all have our feet in both paradigms. How much we live in each paradigm is but a matter of degree. The old paradigm is not necessarily something to be shunned or avoided. There are times when principles of both paradigms can be useful and beneficial. Yet overall, the new paradigm invites more love, support, and deeper connection into our lives and world. In every moment, we can consciously choose the paradigm to which we give our focus, time, and energy. Remember that all of us to some degree are afraid of our shadows. At times we avoid looking at the [disturbing parts of ourselves](https://www.weboflove.org/coreissue) and [our world](https://www.WantToKnow.info). Yet consider that a willingness to explore and even dance with these shadows can be a potent catalyst to a new paradigm. And when we set a clear [life intention](https://www.weboflove.org/lifepurposeintentions) to support [what's best for all](https://www.weboflove.org/keystolife#whatsbest), our lives can't help but become richer and more fulfilling.

NVC gives us the tools to understand what triggers us, to take responsibility for our reactions, and to deepen our connection with ourselves and others, thereby transforming our habitual responses to life. Ultimately, it involves a radical change in how we think about life and meaning. **Nonviolent Communication is based on a fundamental principle: Underlying all human actions are needs that people are seeking to meet.** Understanding and acknowledging these needs can create a shared basis for connection, cooperation, and more harmonious relationships on both a personal and global level. Understanding each other at the level of our needs creates this possibility because, on the deeper levels, the similarities between us outweigh the differences, giving rise to greater compassion. When we focus on needs - without interpreting or conveying criticism, blame, or demands - our deeper creativity flourishes, and solutions arise that were previously blocked from our awareness. At this depth, conflicts and misunderstandings can be resolved with greater ease. **The language of Nonviolent Communication includes two parts: honestly expressing ourselves to others, and empathically hearing others.** Both are expressed through four components - observations, feelings, needs, and requests  though observations and requests may or may not be articulated. Practicing NVC involves distinguishing these components from judgments, interpretations, and demands, and learning to embody the consciousness embedded in these components. This compassionate approach allows us to express ourselves and hear ourselves and others in ways more likely to foster understanding and connection. It allows us to support everyone involved in getting their needs met, and to nurture in all of us a joy in giving and in receiving. The practice also includes empathic connection with ourselves - \"self-empathy.\" The purpose of self-empathy is to support us in maintaining connection with our own needs, thus encouraging us to choose our actions and responses based on self-connection and self-acceptance. NVC was developed by [Dr. Marshall B. Rosenberg](https://www.personalgrowthcourses.net/video/nonviolent_communication_nvc_video_rosenberg), who has introduced it to individuals and organizations world-wide.

NVC was developed by [Dr. Marshall B. Rosenberg](https://www.personalgrowthcourses.net/video/nonviolent_communication_nvc_video_rosenberg), who has introduced it to individuals and organizations world-wide. It has been used between warring tribes and in war-torn countries; in schools, prisons, and corporations; in health care, social change, and government institutions; and in intimate personal relationships. Hundreds of [certified trainers](https://www.cnvc.org/trainers) and many more non-certified trainers around the world are sharing NVC in their communities. ** The Components of Nonviolent Communication ** **1. Observations ** Observations are what we see or hear that we identify as the stimulus to our reactions. **Our aim is to describe what we are reacting to concretely, specifically and neutrally, much as a video camera might capture the moment. This helps create a shared reality with the other person.** The observation gives the context for our expression of feelings and needs. The key to making an observation is to separate our own judgments, evaluations or interpretations from our description of what happened. For example, if we say: \"You're rude,\" the other person may disagree, while if we say: \"When you walked in you did not say hello to me,\" the other person is more likely to recognize the moment that is described. When we are able to describe what we see or hear in observation language without mixing in evaluation, we raise the likelihood that the person listening to us will hear this first step without immediately wanting to respond, and will be more willing to hear our feelings and needs. Learning to translate judgments and interpretations into observation language moves us away from right/wrong thinking. **It helps us take responsibility for our reactions by directing our attention to our needs as the source of our feelings, rather than to the faults of the other person.** In this way, observations  paving the way towards greater connection with ourselves and with others  emerge as a crucial building block towards more meaningful connection. **2. Feelings ** Feelings represent our emotional experience and physical sensations associated with our needs that have been met or that remain unmet. Our aim is to identify, name and connect with those feelings. **The key to identifying and expressing feelings is to focus on words that describe our inner experience rather than words that describe our interpretations of people's actions.** For example: \"I feel lonely\" describes an inner experience, while \"I feel like you don't love me\" describes an interpretation of how the other person may be feeling. When we express our feelings, we continue the process of taking responsibility for", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:inspiration__nonviolent_communication_summary_nvc.txt:1:4e3f596eda00", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 11991, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "inspiration__nonviolent_communication_summary_nvc.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "inspiration__nonviolent_communication_summary_nvc", "chunk_index": 2, "text": "unmet. Our aim is to identify, name and connect with those feelings. **The key to identifying and expressing feelings is to focus on words that describe our inner experience rather than words that describe our interpretations of people's actions.** For example: \"I feel lonely\" describes an inner experience, while \"I feel like you don't love me\" describes an interpretation of how the other person may be feeling. When we express our feelings, we continue the process of taking responsibility for our experience, which helps others hear what's important to us with less likelihood of hearing criticism or blame of themselves. This increases the likelihood that they will respond in a way that meets both our needs. A list of feelings to explore is [available here](http://www.cnvc.org/node/176). **3. Needs ** Our needs are an expression of our deepest shared humanity. All human beings share key needs for survival: hydration, nourishment, rest, shelter, and connection to name a few. We also share many other needs, though we may experience them to varying degrees, and may experience them more or less intensely at various times. In the context of Nonviolent Communication, needs refer to what is most alive in us: our core values and deepest human longings. Understanding, naming, and connecting with our needs helps us improve our relationship with ourselves, as well as foster understanding with others, so we are all more likely to take actions that meet everyone's needs. The key to identifying, expressing, and connecting with needs is to focus on words that describe shared human experience rather than words that describe the particular strategies to meet those needs. **Whenever we include a person, a location, an action, a time, or an object in our expression of what we want, we are describing a strategy rather than a need.** For example: \"I want you to come to my birthday party\" may be a particular strategy to meet a need for love and connection. In this case, we have a person, an action, and an implied time and location in the original statement. The internal shift from focusing on a specific strategy to connecting with underlying needs often results in a sense of power and liberation. We are encouraged to free ourselves from being attached to one particular strategy by identifying the underlying needs and exploring alternative strategies. Feelings arise when our needs are met or not met, which happens at every moment of life. Our feelings are related to the trigger, but they are not caused by the trigger: their source is our own met or unmet needs. **By connecting our feelings with our needs, therefore, we take full responsibility for our feelings, freeing us and others from fault and blame.** And by expressing our unique experience in the moment of a shared human reality of needs, we create the most likely opportunity for another person to see our humanity and", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:inspiration__nonviolent_communication_summary_nvc.txt:2:ac51e7a14390", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 11992, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "inspiration__nonviolent_communication_summary_nvc.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "inspiration__nonviolent_communication_summary_nvc", "chunk_index": 3, "text": "moment of life.

A list of needs to explore is [available here](http://www.cnvc.org/node/179). It is offered as a resource for identifying and experiencing your own needs and guessing others' needs. The needs on this list appear in their most abstract, general and universal form. Each person can find inside herself or himself the specific nuance and flavor of these broader categories, which will describe more fully her or his experience. **4. Requests ** **In order to meet our needs, we make requests to assess how likely we are to get cooperation for particular strategies we have in mind for meeting our needs.** Our aim is to identify and express a specific action that we believe will serve this purpose, and then check with others involved about their willingness to participate in meeting our needs in this way. In a given moment, it is our connection with another that determines the quality of their response to our request. Therefore, when using NVC, our requests are \"connection requests,\" intended to foster connection and understanding and to determine whether we have sufficiently connected to move to a \"solution request.\" An example of a connection request might be: \"Would you tell me how you feel about this?\" An example of a solution request might be \"Would you be willing to take your shoes off when you come in the house?\" The spirit of requests relies on our willingness to hear a \"no\" and to continue to work with ourselves or others to find ways to meet everyone's needs. Whether we are making a request or a demand is often evident by our response when our request is denied. A denied demand will lead to punitive consequences; a denied request most often will lead to further dialogue. We recognize that \"no\" is an expression of some need that is preventing the other person from saying \"yes\". **If we trust that through dialogue we can find strategies to meet both of our needs, \"no\" is simply information to alert us that saying yes to our request may be too costly in terms of the other person's needs. We can then continue to seek connection and understanding to allow additional strategies to arise that will work to meet more needs.** To increase the likelihood that our requests will be understood, we attempt to use language that is as concrete and doable as possible, and", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:inspiration__nonviolent_communication_summary_nvc.txt:3:bcffdf0a9d30", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 11993, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "inspiration__nonviolent_communication_summary_nvc.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "inspiration__nonviolent_communication_summary_nvc", "chunk_index": 4, "text": "we can find strategies to meet both of our needs, \"no\" is simply information to alert us that saying yes to our request may be too costly in terms of the other person's needs. We can then continue to seek connection and understanding to allow additional strategies to arise that will work to meet more needs.** To increase the likelihood that our requests will be understood, we attempt to use language that is as concrete and doable as possible, and that is truly a request rather than a demand. For example, \"I would like you to always come on time\" is unlikely to be doable, while \"Would you be willing to spend 15 minutes with me talking about what may help you arrive at 9 am to our meetings?\" is concrete and doable. While a person may assent to the former expression (\"Yes, I'll always come on time\"), our deeper needs  for connection, confidence, trust, responsibility, respect, or others - are likely to remain unmet. If someone agrees to our request out of fear, guilt, shame, obligation, or the desire for reward, this compromises the quality of connection and trust between us. **When we are able to express a clear request, we raise the likelihood that the person listening to us will feel that they are given a realistic choice in their response.** As a consequence, while we may not gain immediate assent to our wishes, we are more likely to get our needs met over time because we are building trust that everyone's needs matter. Within an atmosphere of such trust, goodwill increases, and with it a willingness to support each other in getting our needs met. Learning to make clear requests and shifting our consciousness to making requests in place of demands are very challenging skills for most people. Many find the request part to be the hardest, because of what we call a \"crisis of imagination\" - a difficulty in identifying a strategy that could actually meet our needs without being at the expense of the needs of others. Even before considering the needs of others, the very act of coming up with what we call a positive, doable request is challenging. We are habituated to thinking in terms of what we want people to stop doing (\"don't yell at me\"), and how we want them to be (\"treat me with respect\") rather than what we want them to do (\"Would you be willing to lower your voice or talk later?\"). With time, and a deeper connection to our needs, our creativity expands to imagine and embrace more strategies. This fourth step in NVC of making a concrete request is critical to our ability to create the life we want. In particular, **shifting from demands to requests entails a leap in focus and in faith: we shift from focusing on getting our needs met, to focusing", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:inspiration__nonviolent_communication_summary_nvc.txt:4:efb93ec3f888", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 11994, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "inspiration__nonviolent_communication_summary_nvc.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "inspiration__nonviolent_communication_summary_nvc", "chunk_index": 5, "text": "want them to do (\"Would you be willing to lower your voice or talk later?\"). With time, and a deeper connection to our needs, our creativity expands to imagine and embrace more strategies. This fourth step in NVC of making a concrete request is critical to our ability to create the life we want. In particular, **shifting from demands to requests entails a leap in focus and in faith: we shift from focusing on getting our needs met, to focusing on the quality of connection that will allow both of our needs to truly matter, and ultimately also to be met. ** ** Empathy ** Expressing our own observations, feelings, needs and requests to others is one part of Nonviolent Communication. The second part is empathy: the process of connecting with another by guessing their feelings and needs. **Empathic connection can sometimes happen silently, but in times of conflict, verbally communicating to another person that we understand their feelings and that their needs matter to us can be a powerful turning point in problem situations. ** Demonstrating that we have such understanding doesn't mean we have to sacrifice our own needs. Connecting empathically with another person can be a catalyst to meeting our needs for understanding, connection, contribution, or others. At the same time, empathy can be a powerful tool to meet the other person's needs. The ability to understand and express the other person's feelings can aid us in finding strategies that meet both of our needs. The language of NVC often helps us relate with others, but the heart of empathy is in our ability to compassionately connect with our own and others' humanity. Offering our empathic presence, in this sense, is a means through which we can meet our own needs. It is a gift to another person and to ourselves of our full presence. When we use NVC to connect empathically, we use the same four components in the form of a question, since we can never be certain of what is going on inside the other. We respect that the other person is the ultimate authority on what is going on for them. Our empathy may meet other people's needs for understanding, or it may spark their own self-discovery. We may ask something like: Observation: When you [see, hear, etc] .... Feeling: Are you feeling ..... Need: Because you need ..... Request: And would you like .....? In an ongoing process of dialogue, there is often no need to mention either the observation (it is usually clear in the context of communication) or the request (since we are already acting on an assumed request for empathy). We might get to guessing a request only after we have connected more and are ready to explore strategies. **In the process of sharing empathy between two people, if both parties are able to connect at the level of", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:inspiration__nonviolent_communication_summary_nvc.txt:5:466f39d4ca05", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 11995, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "inspiration__nonviolent_communication_summary_nvc.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "inspiration__nonviolent_communication_summary_nvc", "chunk_index": 6, "text": "like .....? In an ongoing process of dialogue, there is often no need to mention either the observation (it is usually clear in the context of communication) or the request (since we are already acting on an assumed request for empathy). We might get to guessing a request only after we have connected more and are ready to explore strategies. **In the process of sharing empathy between two people, if both parties are able to connect at the level of feelings and needs, a transformation often happens in which one or both parties experience a shift in attention. This can lead to a shift of needs or generate new reserves of kindness and generosity. **In seemingly impossible situations, it can even open us to remarkable bursts of creative solutions that were unimaginable when clouded by disconnection. ** Self-Empathy ** Both expression of our own feelings and needs, and empathic guesses of others' feelings and needs are grounded in a particular awareness which is at the heart of nonviolent communication. This awareness is nurtured by the practice of self-empathy. **In self-empathy, we bring the same compassionate attention to ourselves that we give to others when listening to them using NVC. **This means listening through any interpretations and judgments of ourselves that we are making in order to clarify how we are feeling and what we are needing. This inner awareness and clarity supports us in expressing ourselves to others, or receiving them with empathy. It allows us to make a request to ourselves about where we want to focus our attention. The practice of NVC entails an intention to connect compassionately both with ourselves and with others, and an ability to keep our attention in the present moment - which includes being aware that sometimes in this present moment we are recalling the past, or imagining a future possibility. Often self-empathy comes easy, as we access our sensations, emotions and needs, to attune to how we are. However, in moments of conflict or reactivity to others, we may find ourselves reluctant to access an intention to connect compassionately, and we may falter in our capacity to attend to the present moment. **Self-empathy at times like this has the power to transform our disconnected state of being and return us to our compassionate intention and present-oriented attention. With practice, many people find that self-empathy alone sometimes resolves inner conflicts and conflicts with others as it transforms our experience of life.** **Summary of Principles of Nonviolent Communication ** (From [http://www.wikihow.com/Practice-Nonviolent-Communication](http://www.wikihow.com/Practice-Nonviolent-Communication)) State concrete actions you observe in yourself or the other person.

This negativity is in part due to our evolution. For more than two million years, the human nervous system has evolved to constantly monitor for threats- real and unreal, reacting more intensely to negative stimuli than ones that we interpret as good and safe. This threat awareness helped keep our ancestors alive. Yet this fear-based perspective by itself, creates three core challenges in the modern era: We separate ourselves from other ways of thinking and being, we overestimate threats, and we underestimate our inner and outer resources. When our fears dominate, we lose touch with what brings out the best in humanity: creativity, collaboration, wonder and awe, social-emotional intelligence, shared purpose, and love. **For every problem you see reported in the news, there are almost always people responding.** And some are doing amazing things. **Just as our negativity bias has helped us to survive, we need to know what is going right and well in the world, and that new ways of seeing and understanding the world are possible.** Emerging neuroscience shows that the brain is designed to change and rewire itself.

Many wisdom traditions see the heart as an organ of inner vision, allowing us to see the deeper meaning in everything we do, from ordinary daily events to the most challenging of circumstances.

Challenge Day has profoundly transformed the lives of countless teenagers and even entire schools around the world. Thousands of [testimonials](https://web.archive.org/web/20120302090516/http://www.challengeday.org/testimonials.php) every year describe in glowing words how this one-day program dramatically changes lives for the better. Challenge Day so inspired me that shortly after I learned about it, I volunteered for one of their day-long programs. I was astounded at how deeply I was affected and how I personally witnessed the lives of so many teenagers being transformed in front of my eyes. **Challenge Day is a one-day program offered in hundreds of high schools every year which opens students to seeing their common humanity in a way that is simply miraculous.** It is not uncommon by the end of the day to find rival gang members hugging each other and saying I'm sorry, even with tears in their eyes. Watch the powerful clip of this profound video at the link below and see if you aren't moved and inspired by this life-changing program.

[**www.sharetheprophecy.com**](https://www.sharetheprophecy.com) This highly intriguing message is from a woman who has had many contacts with ETs since her first dramatic experience in 2003. **They have now been relating to her a bigger picture of what is happening on planet Earth for many years. **Though she initially had serious doubts about their future scenarios, after many of these scenarios came true, she decided to go public with this message about the future, which she calls a prophecy. If the word prophecy or contact with ETs turns you off, I invite you to suspend judgment and give a listen to her story. She shares a fascinating prophecy of visions given by various inter-dimensional contacts relating to the current state of the world and a potential trajectory showing where humanity may be headed. **The message is concerning, yet ultimately very inspiring**. Here's the thrust of her message in a nutshell: Do not engage with the fear being spread. Remain focused on the greater picture. We are powerful creators. Our thought consciousness plays a major role in what unfolds. And if we collectively agree that we are weak and want others to control how we live and think, then that is the reality we will live into.** The biggest lie that has ever been put on humanity is that we are limited, that we are powerless, and that we are unworthy. If humans truly knew what we were capable of, we could rapidly change the whole of our existence with our collective intentional thoughts. **Remember that even a small candle can illuminate a whole room of darkness. I listened to to this incredible, intriguing message/prophecy and ended up feeling that somehow something important up-leveled inside me. I most highly recommend you listen to this most intriguing prophecy. You may appreciate the profound message as much as I did.

Using a technique known as chain analysis, the program targets not only those in direct phone contact with a criminal suspect but anyone with whom those individuals have been in contact as well. The DAS program, formerly known as Hemisphere, is run in coordination with the telecom giant AT&T, which captures and conducts analysis of US call records for law enforcement agencies, from local police and sheriffs' departments to US customs offices and postal inspectors across the country, according to a White House memo reviewed by WIRED. Records show that the White House has provided more than $6 million to the program, which allows the targeting of the records of any calls that use AT&T's infrastructure-a maze of routers and switches that crisscross the United States. [Documents released](https://www.eff.org/cases/hemisphere) under public records laws show the DAS program has been used to produce location information on criminal suspects and their known associates, a practice [deemed unconstitutional](https://www.wired.com/story/carpenter-v-united-states-supreme-court-digital-privacy/) without a warrant in 2018.

One of them shows that we can be brutal, competitive, selfish, and cruel. However, for much of the human experience, we've existed in close communities with our lives depending on each other: cooperating, protecting, and sharing with our community and tribes. In light of these two realities, the question for humanity seems to be: What brings out the worst vs. the best in us? We now live in a world in which our social fabric is in great disrepair. Our ability to work together across our differences seems dangerously degraded. People cluster to groups and media organizations that fit their beliefs, and dismiss other views and outlets. The [loneliness epidemic](\"https://www.wanttoknow.info/a-loneliness-poses-risks-as-deadly-as-smoking-surgeon-general\") poses risks as deadly as smoking. Corporate interests have taken over everything, from social media, food, medicine, and land ownership. For many, the future looks uncertain. **Thankfully, there are powerful remedies and solutions out there to effectively address these issues.** At PEERS, we passionately believe in the **commons:** the democratic norms and practices, public spaces, technological and natural resources, and the open, uncensored flow of information about important issues shaping our lives that we share with each other. In a time where the commons are being eroded, we believe we can use this time wisely to create the world we want to live in. In a [fifteen-year study](https://crab.rutgers.edu/users/goertzel/CollectiveEfficacyEarls.html), Harvard public health professor Felton Earls found that **collective efficacy, the capacity of people to act together on matters of common interest,** made the greatest difference in the health and well-being of individuals and neighborhoods. **Collective efficacy was more influential to the health of a community than wealth, access to healthcare, low crime levels, or other factors.** He suggested that what was most important is neighbors' willingness to act, when needed, for one another's benefit, and particularly for the benefit of one another's children. **Today, we explore rebuilding the commons through sharing and other creative, alternative models for collective resilience. PEERS Executive Director Amber Yang recently interviewed Tom Llewellyn, the executive director for [Shareable](https://www.shareable.net/), a nonprofit news and action hub promoting people-powered solutions for the common good.** In our interview, we discuss the inspiring and creative ways that communities are sharing together and healing the loneliness epidemic.

There are probably more than 40,000 members in over 500 time banks in the US. Many time banks are volunteer community projects, but the one in Sebastopol, [CA] is funded by the city. \"Every volunteer hour is valued around $29,\" Wyatt calculates. \"Now think about the thousands of dollars a city saves when hundreds of citizens serve their community for free.\" The Sebastopol time bank has banked more than 8,000 hours since its launch in 2016. Five core principles ... guide time banks to this day: First, everyone has something to contribute. Second, valuing volunteering as \"work.\" Third, reciprocity or a \"pay-it-forward\" ethos. Fourth, community building, and fifth, mutual accountability and respect. \"What captured me is that people are doing things out of their own good heart,\" Wyatt says. **\"Many years ago, a woman ... said to [civil rights lawyer] Edgar Cahn, 'I have nothing to give.' Edgar Cahn listened and finally responded, 'You have love to give.'

First, they are protecting open Internet access from the Internet service providers (ISPs) that stand to pocket the profits from the rollbacks of net neutrality the Trump administration announced. Second, they are making affordable and fast Internet accessible to anyone. **In Detroit, for example, 40 percent of the population has no access of any kind to the Internet.

Services like the Library of Things and the Stuff-brary in Mesa, outside Phoenix, are part of a broad cultural shift** in which libraries increasingly view themselves as hands-on creative hubs, places where people can learn new crafts and experiment with technology like 3-D printers. Last year, the Free Library of Philadelphia pulled together city, state and private funds to open a teaching kitchen, which is meant to teach math and literacy through recipes and to address childhood obesity. It has a 36-seat classroom and a flat-screen TV for close-ups of chefs preparing healthy dishes. Libraries are looking for ways to become more active places, said Kate McCaffrey of the Northern Onondaga Public Library, outside Syracuse, which lends out its garden plots and offers classes on horticulture. People are looking for places to learn, to do and to be with other people. The Ann Arbor District Library has been adding to its voluminous collection of circulating science equipment. It offers telescopes, portable digital microscopes and backyard bird cameras, among other things - items that many patrons cannot afford to buy. In Sacramento, each item in the Library of Things bears a bar code, since the Dewey Decimal System was not intended for sewing machines or ukuleles. **Note:** Explore more positive stories like this in our comprehensive [inspiring news articles archive](https://www.wanttoknow.info/inspirationalnewsarticles) focused on solutions and bridging divides. **Why Is the Moneyless Economy Thriving in America?** **August 29, 2023, *LA Progressive*** [https://www.laprogressive.com/economic-equality/moneyless-economy](https://www.laprogressive.com/economic-equality/moneyless-economy) The free, moneyless economy is flourishing in America.

When a household item - a clock, a vacuum cleaner, a chair - broke, people used to try to fix it. Now, their first impulse was to throw it away. As a writer focused on sustainability issues, she was disturbed by that. She came up with a solution that led to a career change and inspired an international grass-roots movement: a regular gathering at which people with broken items can bring them to a place where other people can try to fix them. In 2009, she did a trial run in Amsterdam - and it drew many more people than she expected. Word spread, and soon a network of what became known as [Repair Cafés](https://repaircafe.org/en/) began to spread across the Netherlands and beyond.

In Luc's neighborhood, this has meant trimming back bushes that attract malaria-spreading mosquitoes, and making sure roads are clear. **According to Luc, these monthly gatherings have helped his community recover from a long, devastating period of genocide, making it clean, innovative, loving and self-reliant. Across the country ... the tradition of Umuganda has unfolded in similar fashion, helping Rwanda to piece itself back together and recover from ruin**. Though Umuganda is a national phenomenon, the mobilization of it takes place at the community level - specifically, in \"cells\" of at least 50 households called Umudugudu. Spearheaded by a community leader, members of a cell often use the mobile messaging service WhatsApp to work out the logistics. This small-scale organizational structure is key to making Umuganda work. Luc thinks Umuganda has value beyond the projects themselves, promoting self-reliance among Rwandans. \"When you see something wrong within your surroundings, you do not wait for someone else to come and do it for you, you just go for it and do it,\" he says. \"Do Umuganda.

From spreading misinformation and hate speech to undermining democracy and privacy, social media can have negative impacts on the public good. How can we harness the power of social media for positive purposes, such as civic engagement, social justice, and education? One possible solution is to create a new kind of social media platform that is designed to serve the public interest, not the profit motive. This platform would be owned and governed by its users, who would have a say in how it operates and what content it promotes. Such a platform may sound utopian, but it is not impossible. In fact, there are already some examples of social media platforms that are trying to achieve these goals, such as Mastodon, Diaspora, and Aether. **These platforms are based on the principles of decentralization, federation, and peer-to-peer communication, which allow users to have more control and autonomy over their online interactions.** Civic Works ... is an emerging social networking platform that provides a more democratic, inclusive, and responsible online space for everyone. It is built on the idea that social media can be a force for good when the objective is not subverted by advertisers, marketers, or shadowy political operatives. It is a platform that inspires people to become active citizens, through civic, political, economic, and/or educational actions. **Note:** The [social media platform PeakD](https://peakd.com/) is censorship-proof and is governed by network operators who are elected by the community.

One of them shows that we can be brutal, competitive, selfish, and cruel. However, for much of the human experience, we've existed in close communities with our lives depending on each other: cooperating, protecting, and sharing with our community and tribes. In light of these two realities, the question for humanity seems to be: What brings out the worst vs. the best in us? We now live in a world in which our social fabric is in great disrepair. Our ability to work together across our differences seems dangerously degraded. People cluster to groups and media organizations that fit their beliefs, and dismiss other views and outlets. The [loneliness epidemic](https://www.wanttoknow.info/a-loneliness-poses-risks-as-deadly-as-smoking-surgeon-general) poses risks as deadly as smoking. Corporate interests have taken over everything, from social media, food, medicine, and land ownership. For many, the future looks uncertain. **Thankfully, there are powerful remedies and solutions out there to effectively address these issues.** At PEERS, we passionately believe in the **commons:** the democratic norms and practices, public spaces, technological and natural resources, and the open, uncensored flow of information about important issues shaping our lives that we share with each other. In a time where the commons are being eroded, we believe we can use this time wisely to create the world we want to live in. In a [fifteen-year study](https://crab.rutgers.edu/users/goertzel/CollectiveEfficacyEarls.html), Harvard public health professor Felton Earls found that **collective efficacy, the capacity of people to act together on matters of common interest,** made the greatest difference in the health and well-being of individuals and neighborhoods. **Collective efficacy was more influential to the health of a community than wealth, access to healthcare, low crime levels, or other factors.** He suggested that what was most important is neighbors' willingness to act, when needed, for one another's benefit, and particularly for the benefit of one another's children. **Today, we explore rebuilding the commons through sharing and other creative, alternative models for collective resilience. PEERS Executive Director Amber Yang recently interviewed Tom Llewellyn, the executive director for [Shareable](https://www.shareable.net/), a nonprofit news and action hub promoting people-powered solutions for the common good.** In our interview, we discuss the inspiring and creative ways that communities are sharing together and healing the loneliness epidemic. Every day, ordinary people are learning the skills to govern themselves, share their gifts with each other, build an economy that serves all, and create powerful community networks in the face of the world's greatest challenges.

In today's attention economy, the voices who polarize, provoke, and hijack emotions are the ones who get heard. Yet our failure to listen to the sound of the genuine is destroying community, weakening our health, and eroding our sense of safety and trust in life. In times like these, we need MORE viewpoint diversity, not less. **Interwoven with the breathtaking words of visionary theologian and civil rights leader Howard Thurman's 1980 sermon at Spelman College, this [9-minute visual journey](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysktz9vtAuY) captures the real faces, social movements, and societal issues that call us back to the genuine. What does it mean to truly listen to ourselves and each other beneath all the societal noise and the dehumanizing, distorted narratives dominating our media systems?** **Most importantly, we are biologically wired for resonance and shared meaning. This video is made to awaken your mirror neurons-specialized brain cells that activate not just when we act or feel, but when we see others doing the same.** When we witness someone's raw, authentic emotion, something incredible happens: our neurons fire as if the experience were happening to us. This isn't imagination or metaphor, it's straight up biology. We're constantly shaping and being shaped by each other's presence. We can't shift the chaos we're in until we name it clearly. When we can recognize what's really pushing us-in our personal lives and as a society-we already have a degree of freedom from it. **The more grounded and united we are, the harder it becomes for the powerful to distract, manipulate, polarize, and exploit our disconnection from ourselves, each other, and all life on Earth.** Join us in being part of this global team of loving, courageous people dedicated to transformation on this planet. ** [Watch the 9-minute visual journey here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysktz9vtAuY)** [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysktz9vtAuY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysktz9vtAuY) **If this touches something genuine in you, share this widely.

If I were to ask you what is the thing that you desire most in life, you would say ... things that I thought you ought to think that you should say. But I think that if you were stripped to whatever there is in you that is literal and irreducible, and you tried to answer that question, the answer may be something like this: I want to feel that I am thoroughly and completely understood so that now and then I can take my guard down and look out around me and not feel that I will be destroyed with my defenses down. I want to feel completely vulnerable, completely naked, completely exposed and absolutely secure.That I can run the risk of radical exposure and know that the eye that beholds my vulnerability will not step on me. Now if I hear the sound of the genuine in me, and you hear the sound of the genuine in you, it is possible then for me to go down in me, and come up in you. So that when I look at myself through your eyes, having made that pilgrimage, I see in me what you see in me. And the wall that separates and divides will disappear. And we will become one because the sound of the genuine makes the same music. * -Howard Thurman ([listen to full speech here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kkSDCvcvYI) or [read full text here](https://breakingground.us/the-sound-of-the-genuine/)) **RELATED RESOURCES:** Our site serves as a research tool and comprehensive archive for educating the public on deep government and corporate corruption.

They are better at killing pests, reducing plant damage and increasing crop yields, according to the first systematic review of ants' contributions to crop production. Ants are generalist predators and hunt pests that damage fruits, seeds and leaves, leading to a drop in crop yields. A greater diversity of ants generally provides more protection against a wider range of pests, the study found. The analysis looked at 17 crops, including citrus, mango, apple and soya bean in countries including the US, Australia, the UK and Brazil. **\"In general, with proper management, ants can be useful pest controls and increase crop yield over time. Some ant species have similar or higher efficacy than pesticides, at lower costs,\" researchers wrote in the [paper](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rspb.2022.1316) published in Proceedings of Royal Society B**. There are more ants than any other insect, making up [half](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/43145363_Ants_and_sustainable_agriculture_A_review) of the planet's insect biomass. There are at least 14,000 known species of ant, with many more likely to remain unknown.
