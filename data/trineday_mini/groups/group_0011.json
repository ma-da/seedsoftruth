But, as this superb article in San Francisco's leading newspaper makes very clear, **the deeper, hidden purpose of this \"stimulus\" plan is to create a smokescreen which further enables the same mortgage lending scams that have already wreaked havoc to continue at ever higher levels**. This will likely lead to a taxpayer bailout of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and endless future debt payments flowing into the pockets of the bankers and their friends. By spreading the word, we can avoid this and build a brighter future for us all. With best wishes, Tod Fletcher and [Fred Burks](http://www.myspace.com/fredburks) for [PEERS](https://www.peerservice.org) and the [WantToKnow.info Team](https://www.WantToKnow.info/aboutus) [http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2008/02/03/IN8LUO095.DTL](http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2008/02/03/IN8LUO095.DTL) **Stimulus Plan a Scam to Benefit the Rich** **Higher loan limits will lead to Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac bailout** Congress is about to sell us the biggest fraud in American history. It's been highly touted as an economic stimulus bill that will help millions of Americans - and has the backing of both President Bush and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. In the coming year, individuals would receive rebates of up to $600 and families up to $1,200. There are other goodies, too, including tax write-offs for small businesses and an expansion of the child tax credit. But, as the old adage goes, nothing comes for free.** As part of the bill, Congress is set to rush through an increase in the mortgage loan limits for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac (and Federal Housing Administration insurance, too) - from $417,000 to $729,750 - the first step toward a massive financial disaster in which taxpayers will end up paying through the nose.** Here's how we got to this point. Domestic and international investors hold hundreds of billions of dollars in bad debt, because U.S. investment houses sold them junk securities based on often fraudulent mortgages. Many of these mortgages were sold to unqualified buyers under terms that made widespread foreclosures a certainty once", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:008__080206mortgagefraudeconomicstimulusplan.txt:0:075e7b6d2aa8", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 6613, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "008__080206mortgagefraudeconomicstimulusplan.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "008__080206mortgagefraudeconomicstimulusplan", "chunk_index": 1, "text": "Federal Housing Administration insurance, too) - from $417,000 to $729,750 - the first step toward a massive financial disaster in which taxpayers will end up paying through the nose.** Here's how we got to this point. Domestic and international investors hold hundreds of billions of dollars in bad debt, because U.S. investment houses sold them junk securities based on often fraudulent mortgages. Many of these mortgages were sold to unqualified buyers under terms that made widespread foreclosures a certainty once the housing market began to fall. Investment banks and bond rating agencies sat down and tried to figure out how to describe Americans with insufficient incomes and little for a down payment as great credit risks on loans too big for their incomes. The new rules focused on credit scores, because it was a good excuse to avoid looking at income and down payment, factors that would have restricted this moneymaking fiasco. **Now, thanks to Congress, junk bond investors will be able to pawn off their bad debt to Fannie and Freddie, instead of suing the big investment houses for ripping them off. This shift will certainly doom Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, so don't be surprised if we, the taxpayers, have to bail out poor Fannie and Freddie - to the tune of more than $1 trillion.** Why more than $1 trillion? If Goldman Sachs is correct in its recent projections that home prices in California are going to drop 35 to 40 percent, the state's losses alone would top $2 trillion, because California has a disproportionate number of jumbo loans. The irony here is that the collapse in housing prices could make Fannie insolvent even without raising the loan limit. Increasing Fannie's limit is like going on a spending spree with your credit cards because you know you are going to file for bankruptcy in a few months. Only here the taxpayer is left holding the bag. Our children will pay interest on this debt in perpetuity. It is our debt. It is inescapable. In the coming months, Fannie and Freddie will buy up mortgages based on old, fraudulent appraisals and on loans with bogus inflated incomes. Unfortunately, many of these loans will still default. But that's just the start. Brace yourself for another wave of faxes, phone calls and junk mail urging you to refinance at only 1 percent. With zero new regulation, the same bad actors that caused this crisis can once again inflate property appraisals and begin a new cycle of fraud. There are firms that rent assets to people to help them fraudulently qualify for a mortgage - like loaning them money to keep in their bank account for a couple months so they can fool the lender with documented savings that evaporate the day after the mortgage is signed.

Another popular ruse: The borrower pays an employer to pay him a lot of money in a fake job for a month or two so he can show a fat paycheck in his loan docs. Some real estate agents and mortgage brokers actually refer buyers to these services. Contrary to popular myth, Fannie holds a lot of subprime debt, option ARM debt and other dodgy securities. Fannie and Freddie owned or guaranteed almost 45 percent of all mortgages in America last year. BusinessWeek noted in 2007 that Fannie and Freddie have \"moved more prominently into low-documentation loans, which require little or no proof of the borrower's income.\"** Expansion of Fannie and Freddie's reckless lending is exactly what Congress wants because it's plausibly deniable. Teary-eyed lawmakers can take to the airwaves a year from now and declare: \"We had no idea Fannie could go under, but we can't cut and run now.** We have to bail out Fannie and Freddie for the good of America! It's going to be a tough slog, but you're getting used to those, no?\" **Those same lawmakers won't mention the fact that they get paid far more by real estate lobbyists than they do from our Treasury.** I've spoken with borrowers who stopped making mortgage payments seven or more months ago. None has received a default notice. Defaults may be much higher than banks are letting on. The data lags are growing suspiciously long. Nobody knows what's going on. Seven months without making a single payment! Will Fannie guarantee those loans because they aren't in formal default yet? Nobody wants to know, because if they know, they might be called to testify next year. That's why lawmakers want to raise the limits now and ask questions later. **This shortsighted plan poses a terrible risk to every American taxpayer, especially retirees, because Social Security money will be needed to bail out Fannie and Freddie.** And even if you live in high-priced San Francisco, Los Angeles or New York - and stand to benefit from the increased loan limit - this is a horrible fraud on you, too, because raising the limit to $730,000 risks a systemic crisis that will cost far more than any temporary rebate check. In support of the economic stimulus bill, Bush will have to face \"working American families\" and explain that some of their tax money is going to be spent guaranteeing $730,000 mortgages on $1 million homes.

It's like some sort of upside-down communism where the poor pay the rich welfare. Why should taxes from families earning $48,000 a year be used to support expensive mortgages in New York, Los Angeles and San Francisco? Welfare for the hungry and homeless is evil, but welfare for million-dollar homeowners facing a tough refi ... well, that's called \"helping the economy.\" I can imagine the president's radio address playing in the heartland: \"We have some families with million-dollar homes on the coasts who are really hurting and so we need you, the working families of America, to stand together with them and help them avoid the kind of home price depreciation that might leave them without a new Lexus for years.\" I guess Congress' hope is that median-income families will be too busy using their rebates to buy much-needed groceries to notice that the rich folk are getting way with a new scam. **Several months ago, economist Nouriel Roubini of New York University's Stern School of Business suggested that the housing market has been effectively nationalized. At first it seemed crazy, but now it's fairly obvious.** In August alone, Fannie and Freddie increased their loan portfolios by $62 billion, and the Federal Home Loan Bank by $110 billion. That total of $172 billion would come to just over $2 trillion annually - not much less than the entire federal budget. Everyone seeking a loan, securitizing a mortgage, and buying or selling a mortgage security will now be dealing, in one way or another, with the U.S. government. This type of intervention is very expensive and will eat everything in its path, including Social Security. If we're going to have a government-financed intervention, it should be to make sure that Social Security benefits go to those who paid for them, that the poor are fed and housed, or that the army of uninsured receive health benefits. If, as they say, we don't have enough money for those important things, then I think we don't have enough money to bail out banks and bond investors. **Don't let me down, my fellow Americans.

The below message describing the Web of Love is a call for all of us to open to sharing love with all whose lives we touch. By spreading the word of our interconnectedness through love, we can help to powerfully transform our world. **The Web of Love is an energetic web which connects the sacred essence of all beings on this planet.** In that deepest part of our beings, there is in each of us a beautiful, [divine essence](https://www.weboflove.org/transformation#seeing) which wants nothing more than [to love and be loved](https://www.momentoflove.org). The Web of Love, though invisible to our eyes, interconnects all of us through that deepest essence. It literally surrounds and envelops our planet and all who live here. We are all interconnected through sacred love. It is up to each of us how much we choose to be aware of this connection. We are all capable of giving and receiving limitless amounts of love. Many of us have forgotten this and ended up feeling alone or uncared for in our lives. **The Web of Love calls us to remember our true nature. It is a call to join together in sharing the abundance of love that flows within and between us all** through consciously connecting with the Web of Love. **Connecting with the Web of Love** **Breathing the Web.** Here is a simple, yet powerful way of connecting with the Web of Love through breath. Close your eyes for a minute and imagine a sparkling, energetic web connecting the deepest essence of all people in the world. Consider placing your hands over your heart or the center of your chest as you do this. Take a few deep breaths as you open to this image. Now, while taking a slow, very deep inhale, say to yourself: **Your sacred love flows in to me. **Then slowly exhale fully while thinking and feeling: **My sacred love flows out to you.** Repeat this a few times while opening your heart fully to all the love present. Make sure to fill your lungs completely on the in breath and to exhale fully on breathing out. Doing this for just a minute or less can powerfully shift you into a more loving space. Try it now, and invite yourself to really let the love flow! The \"you\" in these sacred love statements can be all people on the planet, or it can be any individual you choose. For some, it might be easier to start this exercise by imagining the one to whom you feel closest in your life. Breathe the web with that special someone in mind and let the love flow between you.

Then envision other people in your life and do the same. When you are ready, envision groups with which you are involved and eventually all people who share our world. This simple breathing exercise can be deeply meaningful in either a personal or a global context. There may be times when you want to breathe the web, but can't remember the words used above. \"Love to me, love to you,\" is all you need to feel the web. You can create your own sayings, too, with words that are more meaningful to you. **The most important element is your intention to connect with all people on this beautiful planet through the Web of Love.** **Bringing the Web of Love into the World** If you are ready to powerfully transform your life, consider taking the Web of Love into your every day world. You might start your day upon awakening and end your day before sleeping with the above exercise. As you start your work, or whenever you feel stressed, take a minute to stop and deeply breathe in the ever present sacred love of the web and of everyone around you. Then on the exhale, fully breathe your sacred love out to all. You can do it with your eyes open or closed. If it helps to start by imagining only the person closest to you, then by all means do so. Throughout the day you can breathe the Web of Love during your daily activities. You can silently breathe the web while waiting at a stoplight, with the checker at the checkout stand, or as you pass someone on the street. Each time you open to this heart connection and practice it, you strengthen the love both in yourself and in the world. **This simple exercise can be done in less than a minute, yet as you practice it more and more, don't be surprised if you find your life transforming in big ways! ** **Important Note.** In opening to loving connection with all people while breathing the Web of Love, a few have experienced difficulty when a person with very strong negative energy came into their thoughts.

It may be best to consciously tell this person's energy to leave your thoughts, so that you can again open to connecting with the hearts", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:008__080214valentinesdayloveideas.txt:1:b122988acafc", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 6619, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "008__080214valentinesdayloveideas.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "008__080214valentinesdayloveideas", "chunk_index": 2, "text": "opening to loving connection with all people while breathing the Web of Love, a few have experienced difficulty when a person with very strong negative energy came into their thoughts.

Find what feels right and best to you in this. **Breathing the Web of Love With a Friend** Once you are comfortable with this exercise on your own, consider going to greater depth by inviting a special friend to join you. Choosing either to gaze into each other's eyes or to keep your eyes closed, feel the love while breathing deeply together: **Your sacred love flows in to me. My sacred love flows out to you. **It doesn't matter that you might both be breathing love in or out at the same time. Just let it flow in whatever way feels best. Once you feel complete, don't forget to take a minute to join in sharing the sacred love you've just generated with all beings on the planet.

Our baby cots were covered with brightly coloured lead-based paint which was promptly chewed and licked. We had no childproof lids on medicine bottles, or latches on doors or cabinets and it was fine to play with pans. When we rode our bikes, we wore no helmets, just flip flops and fluorescent 'clackers' on our wheels. As children, we would ride in cars with no seat belts or air bags. Riding in the passenger seat was a treat. We drank water from the garden hose and not from a bottle - tasted the same. We ate dripping sandwiches, bread and butter pudding and drank fizzy pop with sugar in it, but we were never overweight because we were always outside playing. We shared one drink with four friends, from one bottle or can and no one actually died from this. We would spend hours building go-carts out of scraps and then went top speed down the hill, only to find out we forgot the brakes. After running into stinging nettles a few times, we learned to solve the problem. We would leave home in the morning and play all day, as long as we were back before it got dark. No one was able to reach us all day and no-one minded. We did not have Playstations or X-Boxes, no video games at all. No 99 channels on TV, no videotape movies, no surround sound, no mobile phones, no personal computers, no Internet chat rooms. We had friends, we went outside and found them. We played elastics and street rounders, and sometimes that ball really hurt. We fell out of trees, got cut and broke bones and teeth, and there were no lawsuits. They were accidents. We learnt not to do the same thing again. We had fights, punched each other hard and got black and blue - we learned to get over it. We walked to friend's homes. We made up games with sticks and tennis balls and ate live stuff, and although we were told it would happen, we did not have very many eyes out, nor did the live stuff live inside us forever.

We rode bikes in packs of 7 and wore our coats by only the hood. Our actions were our own. Consequences were expected. The idea of a parent bailing us out if we broke a law was unheard of. They actually sided with the law. Imagine that! This generation has produced some of the best risk-takers and problem solvers and inventors, ever. The past 50 years have been an explosion of innovation and new ideas. We had freedom, failure, success and responsibility, and we learned how to deal with it all. And you're one of them.

Many wonderful supporters from around the globe send us powerful information and suggestions from which we are able to make the high quality messages we bring to you. Until April of last year, all of our work was done by volunteers. Then last April we were thrilled to hire our very first employee, Tod Fletcher, who has done a wonderful job on our weekly news summaries and more. Yet because half of the $40,000 annual budget for our work was coming from my own limited savings, we were sad to have to cut Tod back to 12 hours a week just last month, though he has graciously offered to continue doing news summaries even on that limited compensation. I continue to volunteer full-time on WantToKnow.info and the other five websites managed by [PEERS](https://www.peerservice.org), the nonprofit under which we operate. I am amazed that thanks to a very simple life style, I have been able to stretch my savings to allow me the joy of doing that about which I am most passionate in my life for the last five years. As I sold my car and stopped my health insurance, I am now able to get by on about $1,200 a month. I've learned to consume very little and enjoy the simple pleasures in life in order to do what I feel called to do here. **Yet in order for our work to continue to grow and thrive, I and others involved with WantToKnow.info and PEERS would like to ask for your support.** With a small budget to run all six websites and two email lists managed by PEERS, I am sometimes amazed at how much we get done.

This awareness also fueled my years of research since on common challenges that can be healed more efficiently in a cultural rather than strictly personal context. * The discovery of a sexuality-spirituality split came during a weekend spirituality retreat that I presented in 1984 at Veritas Villa in New York's Catskill Mountains. On Friday evening, I polled the group of forty women and men to determine what areas of recovery they would like to focus on. **A young man in the back of the room sheepishly yelled out, \"Let's talk about sex!\"** Since this was scheduled to be a workshop on \"spirituality in recovery\" everyone found the suggestion amusing. A raucous conversation took place in the room, after which the group implored me to address sex. Always up for a good challenge, I agreed to schedule a Saturday afternoon workshop to investigate sexuality in recovery. In 1984, this was more challenging than it is today. Since the weekend had been created to explore spirituality issues, I felt challenged to integrate the two.

There was another aspect of challenge that tested me in the fifteen hours I would have to prepare for the Saturday afternoon workshop. My co-facilitator was a Catholic nun named Sister Greta! A significantly painful aspect of my own internalized sexual-spiritual split was planted by a nun when I was about seven. I had never totally healed from that trauma - talk about synchronicity! Although I knew Sister Greta to be a highly compassionate addictions counselor, I could feel a critical mass building inside. The universe was going to heal me whether I liked it or not. Friday evening, before I went to sleep, I felt deep within that this situation offered a serendipitous occasion for healing. At that point I still didn't know what to do to create interactive participation around this theme of sexuality within the framework of a spiritual retreat. **With all the symbolic transference that Sister Greta elicited, the lingering awareness that she would be observing and participating, embarrassed and unsettled me.** It triggered all my unconscious fears surrounding my own split. It was hell! In the few spare moments I had between facilitating other aspects of the retreat, I observed my experience with sex as it relates to my concept of spirituality in addictions recovery. I decided that I would share my personal experiences with the group as a stimulus for discussion. As the afternoon approached, I could feel both a fear and a mysterious power building inside of me. At lunch I told Sister Greta how nervous I was discussing sex with her in the room. Of course, I see in retrospect that this was highlighting my own sexual-spiritual split even before I had named it. She fortuitously replied, \"Oh, go ahead, go for it Michael! You aren't going to say anything I haven't already heard; and if you do, I look forward to hearing it.\" As the session started, I stood in front of the room nervously holding a piece of chalk. Sister Greta was sitting on a piano bench in the back corner. I looked back at her and we both began to laugh, and at that moment it came to me. I would share with the group my most recent discovery - how I have been separating the concepts of intimacy, sensuality, and sex in my own mind, and how helpful that realization has been to my own sexuality breakthroughs. **I darted to the blackboard and put those three words, intimacy, sensuality, and sex, in that order, from left to right at the top of the board, and started discussing the words. ** Initially, the group was enlivened though chaotic. They tended to want to lump the words together. I could actually see participants' faces twisted in confusion as they attempted to define these words as independent concepts.

They tended to want to lump the words together. I could actually see participants' faces twisted in confusion as they attempted to define these words as independent concepts. When the confusion was well established, I suggested that group members call out words they associated with the word \"intimacy.\" As they did so, I wrote the following words under the intimacy column on the board: \"warmth,\" \"communication,\" \"honesty,\" \"caring,\" \"smile,\" \"knowing,\" \"trust,\" \"openness,\" and so on. Then we moved to the center column headed by the word \"sensuality.\" As people got silly and awkward they began calling out these words: \"touching,\" \"candlelight,\" \"smell,\" \"lick,\" \"biting,\" \"tickling,\" \"music,\" \"whispering,\" \"massage.\" The list went on and on. Last, I called for words associated with sex, requesting that we not repeat words already used even though they may have sexual associations. People were obviously embarrassed, as I observed them slyly looking at each other. The presence of Sister Greta was ominous. One woman in front of the room whispered \"penis,\" and everyone in the room giggled as I put it on the board. **Then Sister Greta shouted out \"orgasm,\" and the room went into a roar.** I listed it on the board, too. Then the words just started coming: \"vagina,\" \"cum\" (everyone was curious as to where that spelling originated), \"fuck,\" \"suck,\" \"fantasy,\" \"cunnilingus,\" and a few others. Sister Greta laughed and laughed with a magical healing energy. Without needing to overtly acknowledge or define it, everyone knew that a very special healing was touching us all. This laugher fueled another insight in me. I was reminded of my own recent thoughts on how difficult it had been to merge my sexuality with an on-going, loving relationship. My fear of self-disclosure relaxed, and I saw how I might bring the group to a second tier of discovery by sharing my own polarizations in these areas for the group to identify with. For a few more minutes we lingered with our creation on the board. There were still some confused expressions in the room and some quasi-enlightened remarks. Sam, a 22-year-old former marijuana addict shared, \"I have never thought of separating those ideas before. To me they are all the same thing. Looking at them separately sort of twists my brain. I don't know what to do with it, but it looks like an important discovery. What should I do with it?\" Allowing this question to provide a transition into the next level of the exercise, I asked Sam if he would join me in the front of the room to help demonstrate an answer to his question. He agreed.", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:008__080630_sexuality_spirituality_healing.txt:2:7e0413b8d22e", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 6631, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "008__080630_sexuality_spirituality_healing.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "008__080630_sexuality_spirituality_healing", "chunk_index": 3, "text": "separating those ideas before.

He agreed. Sam and I stood facing the blackboard. I suggested that he was representing the entire group in this exercise. I already knew that Sam was not married, he did not have a significant other, and he wasn't dating at the time. I asked him, **\"Sam, if you met someone that you were attracted to, what would you aim toward first, intimacy or sex?\"** While doing this I paced back and forth in front of the board pointing at the three headings, first in one direction, then the other. As I \"walked the board,\" I demonstrated the \"journey\" from each side, first starting with sex (a very common starting point when one has an addictions history), through sensuality and finally to intimacy. Reversing myself, I started at intimacy, moved through sensuality, and then to sex. I then asked Sam and the group to tune into their bodies and feelings and imagine that they were entering a dating situation from both sides, and note their feelings and sensations. Sam blurted out, \"I can't do it. I can't go either way. I can start OK, I can do that from either side, although the intimacy would be new to me. But I don't think I can have both. When I was using pot, it was easy to just have sex. Now that I'm clean, it doesn't work that way. My sponsor says I should date and get to know someone first, but I get terrified and just shut down.\" As I continued walking the board, I asked all the participants to raise their hands as soon as I got to a place where they felt they got stuck or paralyzed. In one walk across, every hand in the room, including Sister Greta's, went up. Everyone looked around in surprise - no one more surprised than me. **Every one of the forty participants experienced the same paralysis that I had thought was my unique struggle.** Everyone in the room acknowledged that they had all thought it was their unique struggle. We were all suffering from a sexual-spiritual split. I shared some of the other damaging sexual messages that I received early on: that God was synonymous with love, warmth, family, goodness and wholesomeness, and that sex was shameful, disgusting, sinful (mortally so), ungodly and spoken of only in whispers, dirty jokes and sneers.

I also told the group that I had uncovered this internalized unconscious split in myself only recently, and that this discovery was finally allowing me to merge these two dynamic, energetic birthrights. We all have our own version of this internalization. With such a deeply embedded, dualistic concept, how can one possibly bond in love and bring shame-based sex into relationship? The unconscious sends up powerful, though often deceptive, barriers that prevent a fulfilling merger. A good example of this comes from my own childhood. When I was about seven, I attended catechism class, which was a requirement for all good Catholics. The class was taught by a nun in full habit: an imposing authority figure to a little boy! The class had about thirty students; in fact, I can remember sitting in the middle of a row on the left. The nun was explaining the difference between venial and mortal sin (venial being the lesser one, while mortal seemed to mean that you would be doomed to eternal hell). **With these definitions on the blackboard, she pointed at them and strongly proclaimed, \"To touch your private parts, or someone else's, is a MORTAL sin! MORTAL, mind you, not venial.\"** I was in shock: I was already doomed. Not only had I touched my private parts, but I had explored the private parts of friends during our games of \"doctor.\" It was devastating to me: not even eight years old, and I was going to hell. I spent many years thereafter trying to repent to God, making deals to not do it again, only to fail in humiliation and sinfulness. I regretfully share that I was 31 years old before I was able to uproot this demon and quiet the internalized havoc that it brought to my intimate relationships. Patrick Carnes touched on the subject of the sexual-spiritual split in his book on sex addiction, *[Don't Call It Love](http://www.amazon.com/Dont-Call-Love-Recovery-Addiction/dp/0553351389/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1?tag=wanttinfo-20&ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1212513542&sr=1-1)*. He writes, \"Much damage has been done to sexuality in the name of religion. The result inhibits progress on both planes. To heal, start by acknowledging that sexuality is about meaning and that spirituality is about meaning. Search for areas of commonness between the two. Be gentle with yourself about old tortuous conflicts. They are not about you.

They never were.\" Initially, most adults in recovery do not realize that they have incurred this psychic split, nor do they remember its origins, but they certainly experience the results. You might find the scenario familiar: once you begin to date, you may experience infatuation, even love and eros. Sex may be very pleasurable. Usually within three to six months, bonding begins as you share struggles and joys. At this point the unconscious polarity begins to haunt the relationship. Since you are not necessarily aware of your past damages or repressed traumas, you may begin to amplify your partner's imperfections in an unconscious attempt to sabotage the relationship. Or you might stay in the relationship and feel inadequate because sex is more work than fulfillment. You may even avoid sex altogether. **Simply stated, once bonding occurs, either love or sex must be abandoned. Until we heal this sexual-spiritual split, they cannot seem to live in the same house. ** People began to ask, \"How can we do it?\" In the uncanny, magical flow of that afternoon, I suggested that we move on to the final piece of the exercise and asked for another volunteer. A man in his mid-40s named Gary stood up. His wife Carol, who was sitting beside him, was aghast, laughing and turning red with embarrassment. Someone else roared out, \"You can't do it, you're married.\" Gary cut through the lighthearted bantering and replied, \"Yes I can. I've been married 14 years and sober for 16, and this damn split has haunted every minute of every day of my marriage. I love Carol, but you would never know it by the way I act sexually and intimately. I'd really like to work on this.\" So we did. During a break that preceded this part of the exercise, we had moved the chairs from the center and I procured some large 16\" x 20\" sheets of paper and some felt-tipped marker to make signs. I asked Gary to stand in the center of the room. I thanked Gary for his honesty and courage to take part in this psychodrama, and then asked him to take a deep breath and relax, look around the room, and notice all the friendly faces. He did so, beginning to smile and relax.** I asked him to go deep into his memory and share with us an early message that he received about sex, and to just look within and say whatever comes up without censoring himself. Gary related, \"You'll go blind if you play with yourself.\"** I thanked him and wrote that message with a felt-tip", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:008__080630_sexuality_spirituality_healing.txt:5:3984b195cbb1", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 6634, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "008__080630_sexuality_spirituality_healing.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "008__080630_sexuality_spirituality_healing", "chunk_index": 6, "text": "him to take a deep breath and relax, look around the room, and notice all the friendly faces.

Gary related, \"You'll go blind if you play with yourself.\"** I thanked him and wrote that message with a felt-tip marker on a placard. Then I asked Gary to pick another participant to represent whoever gave him that message, and he selected an older women named Martha. I asked Martha to hold up the placard six feet in front of Gary and face him. Then I asked Gary for another message that he had received while growing up. He responded, \"Women are sluts.\" I put it on a placard and Gary picked another workshop participant to represent the person who had given him this message. This time he picked a big, strapping man in his late thirties named Mike. I invited Mike to hold the placard in front of Gary next to Martha, and begin to form a circle. This continued with messages like \"Sex is sinful,\" \"Vaginas are ugly,\" \"You are a pervert,\" \"Women should be virgins,\" and so on until we had eight people circling Gary and holding placards toward him. **The last message he shared was, \"You will do it if you love me.\" As I wrote the placard, I asked him what it meant. He answered, almost crying, \"That's what my uncle would say to me when he molested me.\" ** As Gary took some deep breaths to regain his composure he said, \"I've never told anyone, not even Carol, about this before. I can't believe I said it.\" The visual image was quite profound: Gary in the center of the room being encircled by these early messages. As Gary tried to compose himself further, I encouraged him to stay present and avoid zipping up his defenses. To enhance the experiential component of the vignette, I asked the \"message bearers\" to turn the placards toward themselves and loudly read the messages to Gary one by one. I instructed them to keep going around and reading them louder and faster until I asked them to stop. This continued for about two minutes, bringing everyone in the room (especially Gary) to a fevered pitch of discomfort. After stopping the action, I checked in with Gary and asked how he was doing. He replied, \"I can't believe I carry all that with me all the time, especially to bed.\" I then asked Carol if she would participate, to help us complete the exercise. She said yes, and I asked her to stand about six feet outside the circle facing Gary.

She said yes, and I asked her to stand about six feet outside the circle facing Gary. I instructed the message bearers to go around reading the messages one more time. Then I asked Carol if all of this made her feel close or distant from Gary. I said, \"Does it make you want to move closer or further away?\" She replied, \"I want to stay right here, I feel like there is a wall between us.\" I then invited the group to share. **Everyone was enlightened by the realization of how these deep inner messages make sexual intimacy impossible.** They could see it and they could feel it; it was crystal clear. I suggested that we move on to a symbolic exercise that would release these unwelcome, uninvited demons. I directed Gary to slowly, one by one, tell the message bearers, \"Take back your lousy message. I don't want it. It isn't mine and it never was.\" I suggested that as he addressed each one, to tear up the placard and then either throw it on the floor or give it back to the bearer and dismiss them from their role. After Gary \"gave back\" the first two messages, I checked in with Carol. I asked her if she was feeling any different. She reported that she felt a little closer to Gary, that he seemed more open and available as he discharged the symbolic carriers of these messages. I suggested that she move closer as she intuitively felt his availability. When all the messages were confronted, Gary just stood there facing Carol and began to gently weep. As all the walls and barriers melted, Carol gracefully moved towards him. As she did, **Gary fell to his knees sobbing, \"I'm sorry, I didn't know. I didn't mean to push you away like that. I have been bringing all of these ghosts into bed with us all these years.\"** Carol joined him in a kneeling position. They embraced in a manner that included all of us in their intimate connection. The wall of shame was gone. The room glowed with a healing spirit. We all spontaneously became more open, affectionate, and tactile. I stood in warm embrace with Sister Greta. Other participants gently touched or leaned on each other as we all bathed in the intimate healing energy generated by Gary's courageous uncovery process.

Rowling** One of the greatest formative experiences of my life preceded Harry Potter, though it informed much of what I subsequently wrote in those books. This revelation came in the form of one of my earliest day jobs. Though I was sloping off to write stories during my lunch hours, I paid the rent in my early 20s by working in the research department at Amnesty International's headquarters in London. There in my little office, I read hastily scribbled letters smuggled out of totalitarian regimes by men and women who were risking imprisonment to inform the outside world of what was happening to them. I saw photographs of those who had disappeared without a trace, sent to Amnesty by their desperate families and friends. I read the testimony of torture victims and saw pictures of their injuries. I opened handwritten, eye-witness accounts of summary trials and executions, of kidnappings and rapes. **Many of my co-workers were ex-political prisoners, people who had been displaced from their homes, or fled into exile, because they had the temerity to think independently of their government. Visitors to our office included those who had come to give information, or to try and find out what had happened to those they had been forced to leave behind.** As long as I live I shall remember walking along an empty corridor and suddenly hearing, from behind a closed door,", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:008__080825_greatest_good.txt:0:d2626b0586b7", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 6638, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "008__080825_greatest_good.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "008__080825_greatest_good", "chunk_index": 1, "text": "of my co-workers were ex-political prisoners, people who had been displaced from their homes, or fled into exile, because they had the temerity to think independently of their government. Visitors to our office included those who had come to give information, or to try and find out what had happened to those they had been forced to leave behind.** As long as I live I shall remember walking along an empty corridor and suddenly hearing, from behind a closed door, a scream of pain and horror such as I have never heard since. The door opened, and a researcher poked out her head and told me to run and make a hot drink for the young man sitting with her. She had just given him the news that in retaliation for his own outspokenness against his country's regime, his mother had been seized and executed. Every day of my working week in my early 20s, I was reminded how incredibly fortunate I was to live in a country with a democratically elected government, where legal representation and a public trial were the rights of everyone. **Every day, I saw more evidence about the evils humankind will inflict on their fellow humans to gain or maintain power. **I began to have nightmares, literal nightmares, about some of the things I saw, heard, and read. **And yet I also learned more about human goodness at Amnesty International than I had ever known before.** Amnesty mobilizes thousands of people who have never been tortured or imprisoned for their beliefs to act on behalf of those who have. The power of human empathy, leading to collective action, saves lives and frees prisoners. Ordinary people, whose personal well-being and security are assured, join together in huge numbers to save people they do not know, and will never meet. My small participation in that process was one of the most humbling and inspiring experiences of my life. Unlike any other creature on this planet, humans can learn and understand, without having experienced. They can think themselves into other people's minds, imagine themselves into other people's places. Of course, this is a power, like my brand of fictional magic, that is morally neutral. One might use such an ability to manipulate or control, just as much as to understand or sympathize. And many prefer not to exercise their imaginations at all. They choose to remain comfortably within the bounds of their own experience, never troubling to wonder how it would feel to have been born other than they are. They can refuse to hear screams or to peer inside cages. They can close their minds and hearts to any suffering that does not touch them personally. They can refuse to know.

Choosing to live in narrow spaces can lead to a form of mental agoraphobia, and that brings its own terrors. I think the willfully unimaginative see more monsters. They are often more afraid. What is more, **those who choose not to empathize may enable real monsters. For without ever committing an act of outright evil ourselves, we collude with it through our own apathy. ** One of the many things I learned studying classics at the age of 18, in search of something I could not then define, was this, written by the Greek author Plutarch: \"What we achieve inwardly will change outer reality.\" That is an astonishing statement and yet proven a thousand times every day of our lives. It expresses, in part, our inescapable connection with the outside world, the fact that we touch other people's lives simply by existing. **If you choose to use your status and influence to raise your voice on behalf of those who have no voice; if you choose to identify not only with the powerful, but with the powerless; if you retain the ability to imagine yourself into the lives of those who do not have your advantages, then it will not only be your proud families who celebrate your existence, but thousands and millions of people whose reality you have helped transform for the better.** We do not need magic to change the world. We carry all the power we need inside ourselves already: We have the power to imagine better. **J.K. Rowling** is the author of the best-selling Harry Potter book series.

A few months ago while I was sleeping one night, someone asked me in a dream to find out about Caroll Quigley. Upon awakening, I remembered this. Though I didn't recognize the name, I figured it couldn't hurt to do a Google search. Much to my surprise and excitement, I learned that this is the name of a renowned professor of history from Georgetown University who died back in the 1970s. Not only that, he was one of the few historians to ever delve deep into the absolutely critical, but little known role of money and the banking elite in the history of our world. How amazing! I then went on to explore Prof. Quigley's most well known book, *Tragedy and Hope*, and have just completed both a 10-page and a 40-page summary of this most excellent history of the world. **These summaries focus on his discussion of the development and evolution of the banking elite and their secretive, yet powerful influence on world affairs through the ages.** They are quite fascinating and enlightening. To read the 10-page summary, [click here](https://www.WantToKnow.info/articles/tragedy_hope_banking_money_history). For the 40-page summary, [click here](https://www.WantToKnow.info/articles/quigley_carroll.tragedy_hope_banking_money_history). And a big thank you to whoever spoke to me in that dream. Though I've had some amazing dreams in my life, I've never experienced anything like this before, so it is quite exciting to receive that kind of guidance. On another note, major global shift is afoot. Can you feel it? Big cracks are forming in the hierarchical structures which have so long dominated our world. Ever increasing numbers of people are envisioning new and exciting possibilities. **With the support of our readers and subscribers, WantToKnow.info has helped educate over two million people from nearly every country in the world about all that is going on behind the scenes.

I am the only one working full time with PEERS. Though I hope one day to receive compensation for some of my work, for the past several years I have been been volunteering my time and, in fact, draining my savings to keep PEERS operating. Last year I donated $20,000 from my limited savings to keep us afloat. This year, thanks to a welcome increase in contributions, I've only had to donate $10,000 so far, though I may have to increase that amount if we don't receive more support. I would deeply appreciate any support you might be able to offer to continue this empowering work. **Please consider the value of the information we send out to you and many others twice a week through the WantToKnow.info email list.

What's going on is a belief that you can manipulate communicable trust between the leadership and the led. The way you do that is you don't let the press in anywhere. Access to war is extremely limited. The fiercer the combat, the more the access is limited, [including] access to information. This is a direct contradiction of the stated policy of maximum access to information consistent with national security. There was a time in South Africa when people would put flaming tires around people's necks if they dissented.

In the months leading up to the November [2000] balloting, Gov. Jeb Bush ordered elections supervisors to purge 58,000 voters on the grounds they were felons not entitled to vote. As it turns out, only a handful of these voters were felons. This extraordinary news ran on page one of the country's leading paper. Unfortunately, it was the wrong country: Britain. In the USA, it was not covered. The office of the governor [also] illegally ordered the removal of felons from voter rolls-real felons-but with the right to vote under law. As a result, 50,000 of these voters could not vote. The fact that 90% of these were Democrats should have made it news as this alone more than accounted for Bush's victory.

Broken Wing - Transforming Failure to Success By Jim Hullihan Some people are just doomed to be failures. That's the way some adults look at troubled kids. Maybe you've heard the saying, \"A bird with a broken wing will never fly as high.\" I'm sure that T. J. Ware was made to feel this way almost every day in school. By high school, T. J. was the most celebrated troublemaker in his town. Teachers literally cringed when they saw his name posted on their classroom lists for the next semester. He wasn't very talkative, didn't answer questions and got into lots of fights. He had flunked almost every class by the time he entered his senior year, yet was being passed on each year to a higher grade level. Teachers didn't want to have him again the following year. T. J. was moving on, but definitely not moving up. I met T. J. for the first time at a weekend leadership retreat. All the students at school had been invited to sign up for ACE training, a program designed to have students become more involved in their communities. T. J. was one of 405 students who signed up. When I showed up to lead their first retreat, the community leaders gave me this overview of the attending students: \"We have a total spectrum represented today, from the student body president to T. J. Ware, the boy with the longest arrest record in the history of town.\" Somehow, I knew that I wasn't the first to hear about T. J.'s darker side as the first words of introduction. At the start of the retreat, T. J. was literally standing outside the circle of students, against the back wall, with that \"go ahead, impress me\" look on his face. He didn't readily join the discussion groups, didn't seem to have much to say. But slowly, the interactive games drew him in. The ice really melted when the groups started building a list of positive and negative things that had occurred at school that year. T. J. had some definite thoughts on those situations. The other students in T. J.'s group welcomed his comments. All of a sudden T. J. felt like a part of the group, and before long he was being treated like a leader. He was saying things that made a lot of sense, and everyone was listening. T. J. was a smart guy, and he had some great ideas. The next day, T. J. was very active in all", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:008__080923_transform_failure_to_success.txt:0:7c1b80d1d2c4", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 6650, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "008__080923_transform_failure_to_success.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "008__080923_transform_failure_to_success", "chunk_index": 1, "text": "that year.

J. was a smart guy, and he had some great ideas. The next day, T. J. was very active in all the sessions. By the end of the retreat, he had joined the Homeless Project team. He knew something about poverty, hunger and hopelessness. The other students on the team were impressed with his passionate concern and ideas. They elected T. J. co-chairman of the team. The student council president would be taking his instruction from T. J. Ware. When T. J. showed up at school on Monday morning, he arrived to a firestorm. A group of teachers were protesting to the school principal about his being elected co-chairman. The very first communitywide service project was to be a giant food drive, organized by the Homeless Project team. These teachers couldn't believe that the principal would allow this crucial beginning to a prestigious, three-year action plan to stay in the incapable hands of T. J. Ware. They reminded the principal, \"He has an arrest record as long as your arm. He'll probably steal half the food.\" Mr. Coggshall reminded them that the purpose of the ACE program was to uncover any positive passion that a student had and reinforce its practice until true change can take place. The teachers left the meeting shaking their heads in disgust, firmly convinced that failure was imminent. Two weeks later, T. J. and his friends led a group of 70 students in a drive to collect food. They collected a school record: 2,854 cans of food in just two hours. It was enough to fill the empty shelves in two neighborhood centers, and the food took care of needy families in the area for 75 days. The local newspaper covered the event with a full-page article the next day. That newspaper story was posted on the main bulletin board at school, where everyone could see it. T. J.'s picture was up there for doing something great, for leading a record-setting food drive. Every day he was reminded about what he did. He was being acknowledged as leadership material. T. J. started showing up at school every day and answered questions from teachers for the first time. He led a second project, collecting 300 blankets and 1,000 pairs of shoes for the homeless shelter. The event he started now yields 9,000 cans of food in one day, taking care of 70 percent of the need for food for one year. T. J. reminds us that a bird with a broken wing only needs mending.

But the line dividing good and evil cuts through the heart of every human being. And who is willing to destroy a piece of his own heart? * Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn We live in very intense times where all of us are being pushed ever further into polarization. The political climate is such that we are pressured to be either pro-vaccines or an anti-vaxxer, pro-police or anti-police, pro-choice or anti-abortion, and so much more. But is this what we really want? Is this really healthy for humanity? Whatever happened to kindness and compassion? **Though these times are particularly intense, the reality is that for thousands of years this world has been focused on duality and polarization. People have long had a tendency to judge most everything in terms of light vs. darkness, good vs. evil, us vs. them.** We've in many ways been indoctrinated to embrace the light as good, while avoiding and separating ourselves from darkness, as we were taught that it is evil. When engaged in war, other situations of conflict, and even political elections, we tend to see us as good and them as bad or evil, often without even understanding the [deeper reasons](https://www.WantToKnow.info/warcoverup) behind the differences. As a result of these deeply ingrained dualities, we've ended up in numerous conflicts and wars in the world, and even inside of ourselves. The reality is that all of us, including those on both sides of any polarity or conflict, have inspiring creative abilities, whether latent or expressed. Yet it's also important to acknowledge that we all have the capability for destruction. There are ample examples of average people being involved in horrifying, destructive acts throughout history. One blatant example was the response by the people of Germany to official Nazi propaganda that Jews were evil during World War II. Only a very few individuals there were willing to speak against the atrocities committed not only against the Jews, but against homosexuals, Gypsies, those with physical deformities, and more. **There are certainly inspiring examples of heroes who saved hundreds and even thousands of Jews, but the vast majority of German citizens kept quiet.** A [powerful poem](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_they_came...) by German pastor Martin Niemoeller on his choice not to act during World War II exemplifies how people succumbed to polarization propaganda. In Germany they came first for the Communists, and I didn't speak up because I wasn't a Communist. Then they came for the Jews, and I didn't speak up because I wasn't a Jew. Then they came for the trade unionists, and I didn't speak up because I wasn't a trade unionist.

Then they came for the trade unionists, and I didn't speak up because I wasn't a trade unionist. Then they came for the Catholics, and I didn't speak up because I was a Protestant. Then they came for me, and by that time no one was left to speak up. This powerful message applies not only to the time of the Nazis. During the conscious campaign to exterminate Native Americans in the early days of the United States, many good Americans simply turned their heads and took no action to stop this destruction. In the times of slavery, very few spoke out against it. During many other genocidal movements that have taken place around the world and continue to this day, good people have simply avoided talking and even thinking about the issue, thus allowing the massive violence and murders to continue unabated, or to escalate further. Two major experiments demonstrate how polarities and unwillingness to question authority exist in all of us. The first, the [Milgram Experiment](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milgram_experiment), showed that the vast majority of ordinary citizens will inflict pain - sometimes even severe pain - on another person simply because they are ordered to do so by an authority figure. The second, the famous [Stanford Prison Experiment](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanford_prison_experiment), arbitrarily divided normal middle-class young men into the polarized roles of prison guards and prisoners. The results of this disturbing experiment revealed that the young men put into the role of prison guards within days can become aggressive and even violent towards those assigned to play the role of prisoners. Please watch the below documentaries on both of these revealing experiments. **[www.personalgrowthcourses.net/video/milgram_experiment](https://www.personalgrowthcourses.net/video/milgram_experiment) Milgram Experiment (ABC News - 6 min) ** **[www.personalgrowthcourses.net/video/stanford_prison_experiment](https://www.personalgrowthcourses.net/video/stanford_prison_experiment) Stanford Prison Experiment (BBC - 30 min)** These experiments show clearly that we all have destructive capabilities within us. As stated in Solzhenitsyn's quote at the top of this page, \"The line dividing good and evil cuts through the heart of every human being.\" When we don't live with clear intentions, it is easy to be pulled down a destructive path by circumstances, by pressure from authorities, or even by government propaganda.

By taking action when those in authority are clearly leading us into unnecessary wars or otherwise polarizing us, we can play a key role in creating a new paradigm beyond duality which is actually a lot more fun and meaningful than the old ways. **Paradigm Shift ** Humanity is now on the brink of an important paradigm shift. **Our world is now shifting with increasing speed from old dualistic ways of thinking to a new paradigm which accepts both light and darkness, both creation and destruction, both us and them as a natural part of life.** It is time to recognize that dualities and polarizations can be valuable aspects of living in a world with human values. Sometimes it's necessary to destroy outdated things and change old ways in order to make way for the new. Seeds need to be buried in the darkness of fertile soil in order to sprout and grow. Let us open to darkness, destruction, and \"them\" as valued and respected aspects of life which can help us to learn and grow as we work together to find our common humanity. For a poetic example of this, please read the thought-provoking page of the ancient classic *Way of the Wise* (*Tao Te Ching*) at the link below: [**https://www.personalgrowthcourses.net/g/way_of_the_wise_02**](https://www.personalgrowthcourses.net/g/way_of_the_wise_02) This is not in the least to suggest that by opening to the darkness we unleash our base desires and do whatever we want to whoever we want. We need to stop behavior that is destructive or disempowering towards people whenever possible. The suggestion, rather, is that even as we stop the destructive behaviors, we do our best to accept and learn from the darkness which can cause such behaviors, so that we can better be the change we want to see. In other words, even as we stop destructive behaviors, we can open to seeing beyond the behavior to the deeper common humanity we all share. In doing this, we allow for deep healing and transformation to occur. By accepting and embracing the core essence of all people and all parts of ourselves, we open the doors to deep healing and love for all of us. **The new paradigm pierces the veil of judgment to see the beauty that lies deep within each of us.** No matter how \"evil\" some people, some groups (like the power elite), or even some parts of ourselves may appear from the outside, deep down we are simply humans who at the deepest levels want to do what's right, and want to love and be loved.

Although it may appear at times to be horrible, ugly, or scary, [darkness can be a powerful teacher](https://www.WantToKnow.info/secret_societies/deep_insider_creation_story) with its own purpose. We are all here to learn from and find ways to connect more meaningfully with each other. By welcoming back these lost parts of ourselves - these parts of ourselves we have long judged, blamed, and avoided - we not only allow for deep healing, we promote a deep transformation and a shift to a new paradigm which recognizes all people as valued and worthy beings capable of spreading love and joy around the planet. The below ancient Chinese tale speaks to the power of accepting whatever happens, without the need for duality of judgment. **A Chinese Parable on the Wisdom of Acceptance ** * Once upon a time, there lived a man on the northern frontier of China who understood the wisdom of acceptance. One day for no reason, this man's only horse ran away to the nomads across the border. Everyone tried to console him. But he said, 'How do you know this isn't a blessing?' * *Some months later his horse returned, bringing a splendid nomad stallion. Everyone congratulated him. But he said, 'How do you know this isn't a disaster?' * *Their household was richer by a fine horse, which the man's son loved to ride. **One day the man's son fell from the horse and broke his hip. Everyone tried to console him. But he said, 'How do you know this isn't a blessing?' * *A year later nomads came in force across the border. Every able-bodied man took his bow and went into battle. The Chinese frontiersmen lost nine of every ten men. Only because the son was lame did father and son survive to take care of each other. Truly, blessing turns to disaster, and disaster to blessing: changes have no end, nor can the mystery be fathomed.* Let us join in birthing a new paradigm by doing our best to accept whatever happens, even though we may not know the reason or purpose. Let us look for the learning in every situation and live life as consciously as we can every day and every moment of our lives.

Many are asking what is going on with the major banking bailouts in the U.S. and around the world. According to a [Los Angeles Times/Bloomberg poll](http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/laland/2008/09/la-timesbloombe.html), only 31% of Americans supported the bank bailout. Why did politicians around the world ignore the will of the majority of citizens who were against what they felt was a form of corporate welfare? Why are the major media selling this bailout as good and necessary medicine for all of us? Why are so few questioning a bailout which costs $2,500 for every man, woman, and child in the U.S. (assuming that the costs don't eventually far exceed the $700 billion already authorized)? To answer these questions, it is best first to be informed about some very basic, yet little known knowledge regarding money and how banking works. How much do you know about the banking system and who prints the money you carry in your pocket? Considering the vital role money plays both in our individual lives and in the world, our educational system teaches us amazingly little about how money is created, how banks operate, and what causes the huge banking scandals and bankruptcies that have occurred. After reading the information below, you will understand why this information is kept quiet and why we feel it is important to reveal these major banking cover-ups. **The world's wealthiest bankers guard their secrets very closely.** [WantToKnow.info](https://www.WantToKnow.info) specializes in using only the most reliable information available to reveal what is going on behind the scenes in a number of key areas.

We encourage you to have a healthy skepticism of what is presented, yet also to have an open mind to the possibility that much of what is presented is based on verifiable evidence. **The Federal Reserve: Neither Truly Federal Nor a Full Reserve ** **Do you know who prints the money in your wallet or purse?** Take a look at the top of any U.S. bills and you will find \"Federal Reserve Note\" printed along the top. In a small black circle on the left side of these notes, you will read \"United States Federal Reserve System.\" It is the Federal Reserve which prints all bank notes in the United States. Yet who owns the Federal Reserve? Though the [Board of Governors](http://www.federalreserve.gov/pubs/frseries/frseri.htm) of the Federal Reserve is categorized as an independent government agency, \"The Fed\" is not owned by the government. In *Lewis v. United States*, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit stated that \"the Reserve Banks are not federal instrumentalities for purposes of the FTCA [the Federal Tort Claims Act], but are independent, privately owned and locally controlled corporations.\" To verify this fact, please see the Ninth Circuit's decision [680 F.2d 1239](http://cases.justia.com/us-court-of-appeals/F2/680/1239) at the end of paragraph five. The same decision in paragraph 13 states, \"Reserve Banks, as privately owned entities, receive no appropriated funds from Congress.\" It's quite revealing that though the official website of the Federal Reserve contains a [detailed description of the Federal Reserve](http://federalreserve.gov/pf/pdf/pf_1.pdf) that is over 20 pages in length, ownership of the Federal Reserve Banks is never even mentioned. Could it be that this information is conveniently withheld to keep the public from understanding who owns the banks which issue all U.S. dollars? **Though Federal Reserve Board members are appointed by the U.S. President and confirmed by the Senate, the Federal Reserve is a privately owned institution controlled mainly by large private banks.** Once board members are appointed, the U.S. government has no control over their decisions other than the president's ability to remove a board member. Yet a study of [the history and functions](http://www.monetary.org/federalreserveprivate.htm) of the Federal Reserve reveals that powerful bankers such as J.P. Morgan have had inordinate power and control over the formation and management of the monetary policy of the United States through their power over the Fed. **Congress has virtually no influence over this incredibly powerful institution.** Neither does the Fed have reserves to back all", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:008__081021_banking_bailout_secrets.txt:1:c54f4f80bdaa", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 6659, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "008__081021_banking_bailout_secrets.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "008__081021_banking_bailout_secrets", "chunk_index": 2, "text": "has no control over their decisions other than the president's ability to remove a board member.

Morgan have had inordinate power and control over the formation and management of the monetary policy of the United States through their power over the Fed. **Congress has virtually no influence over this incredibly powerful institution.** Neither does the Fed have reserves to back all of the credit it issues. None of the money in circulation is backed by anything of real value such as gold or silver. The backing of U.S. currency by a [gold standard was removed](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_standard) under President Nixon in 1971. In fact, the Fed, like all banks, at any one time has only 3 to 10% of all credit issued held in reserve as bank notes. So the Federal Reserve is neither truly federal, nor a full reserve. It is not owned or directly controlled by the United States government. The fact that the words \"United States Federal Reserve System\" are printed on every U.S. bank note thus raises serious questions. **The foundation for the Federal Reserve system was crafted in the utmost secrecy in 1910 at the [Jekyll Island resort](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jekyll_Island#Planning_of_the_Federal_Reserve_System) by several powerful men with very close ties to the [Rockefellers](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rockefellers), the [J.P. Morgan](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J.P.Morgan) family, and the [Rothschilds](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rothschilds)** - the richest and most powerful families in the world at that time. A version of the legislation crafted eventually passed in 1913 over the objections of many who feared that turning over control of the nation's money supply to a consortium of private bankers would inevitably only produce more riches for the ultra rich at the expense of the general public. Virtually everyone agrees that the Fed is highly secretive. [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_reserve#Criticisms) lists other criticisms of the Federal Reserve in the below two paragraphs: \"A large and varied group of criticisms have been directed against the Federal Reserve System. One group of criticisms, typified by the [Austrian School](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austrian_School), criticize the Federal Reserve as unnecessary and counterproductive interference in the economy. Other arguments include arguments in favor of the [gold standard](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_standard) and criticisms of an alleged lack of accountability or culture of secrecy within the Reserve. Finally, a group of conspiracy theories make various charges against the Federal Reserve, generally claiming the Federal Reserve System is actually a scheme to enrich a few wealthy bankers at the expense of the public.\" \"Economists of the Austrian School such as [Ludwig von Mises](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ludwig_von_Mises) contend that the Federal Reserve's artificial manipulation of the money supply leads to the boom/bust business cycle that has occurred over the last century.

Ben Bernanke, Chairman of the Board of Governors of Federal Reserve, stated: 'I would like to say to Milton [Friedman] and Anna [J. Schwartz]: Regarding the Great Depression. You're right, we did it. We're very sorry. But thanks to you, we won't do it again.'** [[22]](http://www.federalreserve.gov/BOARDDOCS/SPEECHES/2002/20021108/default.htm) [[23]](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/10/28/AR2005102802426_2.html)\" **The Fractional Reserve System: Creating Money Out of Thin Air ** Another aspect of banking about which most people know little to nothing is the fractional reserve system. [Fractional-reserve banking](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fractional-reserve_banking) refers to the common banking practice of issuing more money than the bank holds as reserves. Banks in modern economies typically loan their customers *many times* the sum of the cash reserves that they hold.\" **Did you know that for every dollar in your checking or savings account, the bank can legally loan out $10 or more?** Here's a description of the origins of fraction reserve banking from a standard university macroeconomics text [[1](#1)]: \"When the ancients began to use gold in making transactions, it became apparent that it was both unsafe and inconvenient for consumers and merchants to carry gold and have it weighed and assessed for purity every time a transaction was negotiated. It therefore became commonplace to deposit one's gold with goldsmiths whose vaults or strongrooms could be used for a fee. Upon receiving a gold deposit, the goldsmith issued a receipt to the depositor. Soon goods were traded for the goldsmiths' receipts and the receipts became the first kind of paper money. \"At this point the goldsmiths - embryonic bankers - used a 100% reserve system; their circulating paper money receipts were fully backed by gold. But, given the public's acceptance of the goldsmiths' receipts as paper money, the goldsmiths became aware that the gold they stored was rarely redeemed. Then some adroit banker hit on the idea that paper money could be issued *in excess of* the amount of gold held. Goldsmiths [then began to issue] additional 'receipts' ... into circulation by making interest-earning loans in the form of gold receipts. This was the beginning of the *fractional reserve system* of banking.\" **The college text from which the above quote is taken does not question the propriety of goldsmiths creating these new \"receipts\" or money without any gold backing, without any authority, and indeed without any real reason to do so other than to enrich themselves. In fact, the text even praises", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:008__081021_banking_bailout_secrets.txt:3:bde5ab786b8a", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 6661, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "008__081021_banking_bailout_secrets.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "008__081021_banking_bailout_secrets", "chunk_index": 4, "text": "[then began to issue] additional 'receipts' ... into circulation by making interest-earning loans in the form of gold receipts. This was the beginning of the *fractional reserve system* of banking.\" **The college text from which the above quote is taken does not question the propriety of goldsmiths creating these new \"receipts\" or money without any gold backing, without any authority, and indeed without any real reason to do so other than to enrich themselves. In fact, the text even praises the questionable behavior of the one who began this hidden form of corruption as \"adroit.\"** The unsuspecting public had no idea that goldsmiths were issuing paper receipts accepted as money which were backed by no gold deposits at all for ten times or more the amount of gold that had been entrusted to them. The goldsmiths were secretly creating money out of thin air. They thus made themselves fantastically wealthy without anyone noticing what was going on. In order to better hide this deceit and divert people's attention, the goldsmiths stopped their old practice of charging for storing gold and instead began to pay customers a small interest on their gold deposits to keep them happy. Thus it was that modern day bankers were born. Amazingly, the system has changed little today. Macroeconomics professors, college texts, and all involved with banking almost never question the ethics or morality of this fractional reserve system. No one even questions in any meaningful way the ethics and corruption involved in creating money out of thin air. In fact, the fractional reserve system was formalized into law centuries ago and continues to be both legal and the accepted common practice around the world today. Have you ever wondered how banks can afford to own those massive buildings downtown if they are only charging 15% or so on loans and paying 5% in interest on deposits? If bankers were not allowed to create money out of thin air, they would be making only 10% or so a year on every loan they issued, far from enough to build the towering skyscrapers owned by banks in practically every major city. But **by creating credit (money) using the fractional reserve system, bankers can legally claim credit to 10 times or more the amount of any loan. **Now you can understand the foundation upon which global banking empires are built. As this system has been used for centuries by every country in the world, it clearly works to maintain a relatively stable economic order. We are not advocating a dramatic change of this system.

A Google or Yahoo search can help. **By reviewing the in-depth research carried out by organizations that you support, you can save yourself lots of time and feel better about your choices on candidates and propositions about which you don't know much. ** Using the 2008 U.S. elections as an example, Americans can do a search on \"2008 elections endorsements\" (without the quotation marks) followed by your state name or county name or both.

You may even be able to find a chart which compares the recommendations of numerous organizations. Do this by using words in your search like \"comparison\" and/or \"chart.\" Using this method, I found the most excellent link below which provides an easy to use list comparing what 40 different organizations of all political persuasions are saying about the various California propositions.

Would the government ever really consider such a thing? ***The Men Who Stare at Goats***** by [Jon Ronson](http://www.jonronson.com/) is one of those rare, well received books, which clearly reveals the depth of deception found within secret government projects. **The *New York Times* book review below gives an idea of the depths which Ronson's engaging book plumbs. With a wonderfully wry sense of humor, the intreprid Ronson explores a strange, yet real world where US soldiers are actually trained to be psychic killers in these top secret projects. This may sound impossible to believe, yet if you read the below *Times* book review and explore the links provided to reliable, verifiable information on this topic, you may begin to wonder. Though I was reluctant to broach this topic in the past, thanks to the publicity raised by *The Men Who Stare at Goats* and movies like *The Manchurian Candidate*, I can now tell you that I have received abundant information from a variety of reliable sources about various psychic programs hidden beneath Byzantine layers of secrecy in government. One of those sources is WantToKnow.info team member Carol Rutz. Carol is a recovered survivor of [MK-ULTRA](https://www.WantToKnow.info/050626mkultra) and other secret programs where, among other duties, she was trained to be a psychic killer back in the 1960s. Read our summary of her engaging, well documented book *A Nation Betrayed* at the link below.

Simon & Schuster. $24. At the start of the twisted treasure hunt that is ''The Men Who Stare at Goats,'' the journalist Jon Ronson appears to be looking for furtive, paranoid quacks who play mind games. He seems to have hit the mother lode. Take the goats of the title: Mr. Ronson cites a hundred of them. He says that they have been hidden at a Goat Lab at Fort Bragg in North Carolina and de-bleated for security reasons. They have been used in top-secret experiments by psychic spies whose existence is not officially acknowledged by the United States Army. Military psychics are so well hidden that they aren't covered by the Army's coffee budget. It makes them cranky to have to bring their own coffee to work. **''The damn psychic spies should be keeping their damn mouths shut, instead of chitchatting all over town about what they did.'' So says retired Maj. Gen. Albert N. Stubblebine III, the first of the many characters redolent of ''Dr. Strangelove'' who are found in this jaw-dropper of a -- hard to believe, but, yes -- nonfiction story.** **Some of these experts contend that a goat's heart can be stopped by the intense gaze of a certain kind of supersoldier. ''Goat didn't have a chance,'' one of these tough guys tells Mr. Ronson.** Such fighters sometimes refer to themselves as Jedi Warriors, because the thinking about their occult superpowers dates back to early ''Star Wars'' days. It was then that the post-Vietnam military, demoralized and fiscally hamstrung, was ready to try anything in the way of intangible new weaponry. Mr. Ronson sets his book up beautifully. It moves with wry, precise agility from crackpot to crackpot in its search for the essence of this early New Age creativity. Much of it can be traced to the 1977 fact-finding mission of Lt. Col. Jim Channon, now also retired but given credit for an influential legacy. It was Colonel Channon's 125-page ''First Earth Battalion Operations Manual'' that suggested a whole new approach to combat and a whole new type of military uniform. According to Colonel Channon's plan, soldiers' uniforms should include pouches for ginseng regulators, divining tools and loudspeakers that would emit ''indigenous music and words of peace.'' The author's explorations also take him to one soldier of fortune who died after ''acting too big for his boots regarding his superhuman powers,'' and to a New Age company alleged to be dealing in both healing bars (costing $7,600 and resembling blocks of soap) and group sex (''Don't tell your husband because he wouldn't understand the energy work''). Then there are the double agents supposedly operating within the flying saucer set. ''The [U.F.O. community](https://www.WantToKnow.info/ufocover-up)?'' the author asks one source. ''Why would government spies want to infiltrate that?'' ''Oh,", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:008__081202_psychic_killers_government.txt:1:cbaca4a18ee8", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 6667, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "008__081202_psychic_killers_government.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "008__081202_psychic_killers_government", "chunk_index": 2, "text": "of fortune who died after ''acting too big for his boots regarding his superhuman powers,'' and to a New Age company alleged to be dealing in both healing bars (costing $7,600 and resembling blocks of soap) and group sex (''Don't tell your husband because he wouldn't understand the energy work''). Then there are the double agents supposedly operating within the flying saucer set. ''The [U.F.O. community](https://www.WantToKnow.info/ufocover-up)?'' the author asks one source. ''Why would government spies want to infiltrate that?'' ''Oh, Jon,'' the source tells him, delivering the kind of swift punch line that makes this book so entertaining. ''Don't be naïve.'' At this point, ''The Men Who Stare at Goats'' still concentrates on quirks, making it a smarter, nuttier version of ''The Tipping Point'' or ''Blink.'' But then it moves into a different realm. While Colonel Channon was asserting that the military should be ''unafraid to appear harebrained and half-baked in their pursuit of a new kind of weapon,'' a parallel and less theoretical set of experiments was unfolding. And Mr. Ronson addresses the more sinister aspect of out-of-the-box military thinking. ''The Men Who Stare at Goats'' turns into a book that connects dots. It sees a common thread in the use of screamingly bad music to assault Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega in Panama and the use of similar tactics in the destruction of the Branch Davidian compound in Waco, Tex. In these accounts, Mr. Ronson writes as much about schemes that were only contemplated as about the ones that actually made the cut. **For instance, he describes the effort to deploy a Moscow scientist who had previously sent subliminal messages to Red Army troops (''Do not get drunk before battle'') in the Branch Davidian standoff. This scientist didn't work out because he was unwilling to transmit words spoken by Charlton Heston as a bogus voice of God. ** Mr. Ronson, a filmmaker and journalist whose earlier book, ''[Them: Adventures With Extremists](http://www.amazon.com/Them-Adventures-Extremists-Jon-Ronson/dp/0743233212?tag=wanttinfo-20),'' was also outstandingly artful and chilling, eventually follows his trail of bread crumbs to the realms that really matter. **He finds a prologue in [MK-ULTRA](https://www.WantToKnow.info/050626mkultra), the real C.I.A. ''Manchurian Candidate'' research of the 1950's, which involved the disastrous use of LSD as a potential truth serum.** He follows this line of thinking through and beyond the fruitcake innovations of the 1970's, concluding that Colonel Channon's theories ''could be used to shatter people rather than heal them.'' ''Those are the ideas that live on in the War on Terror,'' he adds. Inevitably, this account extends to the tactics of American guards at the Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq. **And somehow Mr. Ronson is able to keep his book both light and nightmarish.** (Asked if there was a single good thing to be said about the prison, one former guard says it was an address to which Amazon.com delivered.)

Absurdity is never far away. Discussing the weird tricks played on prisoners in both Iraq and Cuba, he finds the English journalist Martin Bashir interviewing one former captive. Mr. Bashir asks whether the prisoner saw his now-notorious Michael Jackson documentary. ''Jamal replied, 'I've, uh, been in Guantánamo Bay for two years.''' **Mr. Ronson, who lives in London and exclaims the occasional ''bloody hell'' at these discoveries, remains terrifically adept at capturing the horror of these developments without losing track of their lunacy**. About propaganda dropped from airplanes: ''The Americans have always been better than the Iraqis at the leaflets.'' Early in the 1991 Persian Gulf war, he says, Iraqi psychological warfare meant telling American soldiers: ''Your wives are back at home having sex with Bart Simpson and Burt Reynolds.''

Smith **This explosive exposé reveals how industry manipulation and political collusion-not sound science-allow dangerous genetically modified (GM) food into your daily diet.** Company research is rigged, alarming evidence of health dangers is covered up, and intense political pressure applied. Chapters draw you in like adventure stories. Scientists are offered bribes and threatened. Evidence is stolen. Data is destroyed. Government employees who complain are harassed, stripped of responsibilities, or fired. In one study, laboratory rats fed a GM crop developed stomach lesions and seven of the forty rats died within two weeks. Yet as the conclusions failed to mention these \"details,\" the crop was approved based on this study without further tests. Hailed as the best book on the topic, many believe that the revelations in this book can eradicate this huge threat to our diet, and indeed to our very well being.

It was originally published in the December 14, 1982 issue of *Woman's Day* magazine. This moving story inspired the creation of [The White Envelope Project](http://www.WhiteEnvelopeProject.org), a caring nonprofit organization dedicated to developing the next generation of givers, civic leaders, and philanthropists. May this inspirational story remind us all of the true meaning of Christmas and giving during the holidays and throughout the year. **Christmas Story: For the Man Who Hated Christmas By Nancy W. Gavin** It's just a small, white envelope stuck among the branches of our Christmas tree. No name, no identification, no inscription. It has peeked through the branches of our tree for the past ten years. It all began because my husband Mike hated Christmas. Oh, not the true meaning of Christmas, but the commercial aspects of it - overspending and the frantic running around at the last minute to get a tie for Uncle Harry and the dusting powder for Grandma - the gifts given in desperation because you couldn't think of anything else. Knowing he felt this way, I decided one year to bypass the usual shirts, sweaters, ties and so forth. I reached for something special just for Mike. The inspiration came in an unusual way. Our son Kevin, who was 12 that year, was on the wrestling team at the school he attended. Shortly before Christmas, there was a non-league match against a team sponsored by an inner-city church. These youngsters, dressed in sneakers so ragged that shoestrings seemed to be the only thing holding them together, presented a sharp contrast to our boys in their spiffy blue and gold uniforms and sparkling new wrestling shoes. As the match began, I was alarmed to see that the other team was wrestling without headgear, a kind of light helmet designed to protect a wrestler's ears. It was a luxury the ragtag team obviously could not afford. Well, we ended up walloping them. We took every weight class. Mike, seated beside me, shook his head sadly, \"I wish just one of them could have won,\" he said. \"They have a lot of potential, but losing like this could take the heart right out of them.\" Mike loved kids - all kids. He so enjoyed coaching little league football, baseball and lacrosse. That's when the idea for his present came. That afternoon, I went to a local sporting goods store and bought an assortment of wrestling headgear and shoes, and sent them anonymously to the inner-city church. On Christmas Eve, I placed a small, white envelope on the tree, the note inside telling Mike what I had done, and that this was his gift from me. Mike's smile was the brightest thing about Christmas that year.

Mike's smile was the brightest thing about Christmas that year. And that same bright smile lit up succeeding years. For each Christmas, I followed the tradition - one year sending a group of mentally handicapped youngsters to a hockey game, another year a check to a pair of elderly brothers whose home had burned to the ground the week before Christmas, and on and on. The white envelope became the highlight of our Christmas. It was always the last thing opened on Christmas morning, and our children - ignoring their new toys - would stand with wide-eyed anticipation as their dad lifted the envelope from the tree to reveal its contents. As the children grew, the toys gave way to more practical presents, but the small, white envelope never lost its allure. The story doesn't end there. You see, we lost Mike last year due to dreaded cancer. When Christmas rolled around, I was still so wrapped in grief that I barely got the tree up. But Christmas Eve found me placing an envelope on the tree. And the next morning, I found it was magically joined by three more. Unbeknownst to the others, each of our three children had for the first time placed a white envelope on the tree for their dad. The tradition has grown and someday will expand even further with our grandchildren standing to take down that special envelope. Mike's spirit, like the Christmas spirit will always be with us. **Note:** To see the inspiring organization that was born out of this moving Christmas story, [click here](http://www.WhiteEnvelopeProject.org). **For several other short, inspiring Christmas stories, [click here](https://www.WantToKnow.info/i/christmas-stories/christmas_stories). ** [http://addthis.com/bookmark.php?v=250&pub=peers&url=https://www.WantToKnow.info/i/christmas-stories/meaning-of-christmas&title=](http://addthis.com/bookmark.php?v=250&pub=peers&url=https://www.WantToKnow.info/i/christmas-stories/meaning-of-christmas&title=) **For more inspiration: ** See our awesome collection of inspiring resources in our [Inspiration Center](https://www.WantToKnow.info/inspirational).

Shortly after the first strike on the World Trade Center, which occurred at 8:46 AM on 9/11, Michael Hess, New York City's corporation counsel, and Barry Jennings, the deputy director of the Emergency Services Department of the New York City Housing Authority, headed to the Office of Emergency Management's Emergency Operations Center, which was on the 23rd floor of WTC 7, where they assumed that Mayor Rudy Giuliani would be. But when Hess and Jennings arrived, the place was empty. Jennings then telephoned someone to ask what they should do and was told that they should leave immediately. Finding that the elevators would not work, they started down the stairs. When they reached the sixth floor, however, there was a powerful explosion beneath them, which, Jennings told the makers of \"Loose Change: Final Cut,\" [[1]](#_edn1) caused the landing on which they were standing to give way. Making their way back up to the eighth floor, they were able to break a window and call for help. Hess later reported: \"[W]e were trapped on the eighth floor with smoke, thick smoke, all around us, for about an hour and a half [before] the New York Fire Department . . . came and got us out.\" [[2]](#_edn2) Hess had made this statement while being interviewed by Frank Ucciardo of UPN 9 News \"on Broadway about a block from City Hall,\" which was several blocks from WTC 7. This interview began before noon. As to the exact time, it has been believed that it began at 11:34. This belief has been based on the fact that, according to writing on a DVD containing UPN 9 programs from that morning, the programs contained on the video had begun at 10:37 AM. The Hess interview begins at the 57-minute mark, which would have been 11:34. Further research, however, showed that the video actually started at 11:00. The crucial evidence is that, at the 111-minute mark, the UPN 9 program switched to live CNN coverage of a Taliban news conference, which began at 12:51,[[3]](#_edn3) and 111 minutes prior to 12:51 would be 11:00. The Hess interview, as we saw, began at the 57-minute mark, so it began at 11:57. In any case, UPN 9's interview of Hess began before noon. This fact is important, because NIST---the National Institute of Standards and Technology---which provided the official explanation of the collapse of the Twin Towers and WTC 7, claimed that Hess and Jennings were not rescued until after noon. In its \"Interim Report on WTC 7\", which was published in 2004, NIST claimed that the two men were rescued at", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:008__hessjenningswtc7explosiontvbroadcast.txt:0:dd1a226e2286", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 6678, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "008__hessjenningswtc7explosiontvbroadcast.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "008__hessjenningswtc7explosiontvbroadcast", "chunk_index": 1, "text": "saw, began at the 57-minute mark, so it began at 11:57.

In its \"Interim Report on WTC 7\", which was published in 2004, NIST claimed that the two men were rescued at \"12:10 to 12:15 PM.\" [[4]](#_edn4) But if Hess was being interviewed several blocks away from WTC 7 before noon, that claim is impossible. Why might NIST have made this claim? A reason is suggested by a statement about Hess and Jennings in another NIST document, which says: \"With the collapse of the two towers, a New York City employee and a WTC 7 building staff person became trapped inside of WTC 7. The two had gone to the OEM center on the 23rd floor and found no one there. As they went to get into an elevator to go downstairs the lights inside of WTC 7 flickered as WTC 2 [the South Tower] collapsed. At this point, the elevator they were attempting to catch no longer worked, so they started down the staircase.\" [[5]](#_edn5) According to NIST, therefore, Hess and Jennings, upon finding the OEM center vacated, started down the stairs just after 9:59, when the South Tower collapsed. It was this collapse, NIST suggested, that was responsible for the elevator's failure to work. As we saw earlier, however, Jennings said that they had arrived at the OEM center shortly after the strike on the North Tower, hence around 9:00 AM. He added, in fact, that he had to have been on the 23rd floor \"when the second plane hit.\" [[6]](#_edn6) It was shortly after that event, Jennings suggested, that he and Hess started down the stairs. But according to NIST, Hess and Jennings did not start down stairs shortly after the strike on the South Tower, which occurred at 9:03, but shortly after the collapse of the South Tower, which occurred at 9:59. Besides contradicting Jennings' testimony on that point, NIST's account went on to say: \"When they got to the 6th floor, WTC 1 [the North Tower] collapsed, the lights went out in the staircase, the sprinklers came on briefly, and the staircase filled with smoke and debris. The two men went back to the 8th floor broke out a window and called for help.\" [[7]](#_edn7) According to NIST, therefore, what Hess and Jennings took to be an explosion in WTC 7 was really just an effect of the collapse of the North Tower. That collapse occurred at 10:28. Accordingly, if the two men were then trapped for about 90 minutes before they were rescued, as Hess said, then this rescue must have occurred at about noon. This", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:008__hessjenningswtc7explosiontvbroadcast.txt:1:1df99a8dda67", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 6679, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "008__hessjenningswtc7explosiontvbroadcast.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "008__hessjenningswtc7explosiontvbroadcast", "chunk_index": 2, "text": "The two men went back to the 8th floor broke out a window and called for help.\" [[7]](#_edn7) According to NIST, therefore, what Hess and Jennings took to be an explosion in WTC 7 was really just an effect of the collapse of the North Tower. That collapse occurred at 10:28. Accordingly, if the two men were then trapped for about 90 minutes before they were rescued, as Hess said, then this rescue must have occurred at about noon. This seems to be the basis for NIST's claim that they were rescued at \"12:10 to 12:15 PM.\" NIST's timeline is clearly implausible. Claiming that Hess and Jennings started down the stairs after the collapse of the South Tower caused the elevator to fail, NIST implies that it took them 29 minutes---from 9:59 to 10:28---to descend from the 23rd floor to the 6th floor. This claim is especially implausible in light of Jennings' description of his descent, in which he said: \"I wanted to get out of that building in a hurry, so I started, instead of taking one step at a time, I'm jumping landings.\" [[8]](#_edn8) NIST's timeline requires, by contrast, that it took Jennings and Hess almost a half hour---from about 9:59, when the South Tower collapsed, until 10:28, when the North Tower collapsed---to get down those 17 flights of stairs. NIST's timeline is also directly contradicted by the testimony of Jennings, who said: \"When we made it back to the 8th floor, . . . both buildings were still standing.\" [[9]](#_edn9) How did Jennings know that they were still standing? Jennings' statement, quoted more fully---\"When we made it back to the 8th floor, . . . both buildings were still standing. Because I looked to---I looked one way, looked the other way, now there's nothing there. . . . [B]oth buildings were still standing\" [[10]](#_edn10) ---might be taken to mean that he could see the Twin Towers. That would entail that he and Hess were on the south side of WTC 7, which faced the towers. But that would be incorrect. Jennings stated that he was on \"the North side of the building.\" He indicated, moreover, that when the towers fell, he could not see them fall: \"I was trapped in there when both buildings came down. The firefighters came. . . . And then they ran away. See, I didn't know what was going on. That's when the first tower fell. When they started running, the first tower was coming down. I had no way of knowing that. Then I saw them come back. Now I saw them come back with more concern on their faces. Instead, they ran away again: the second tower fell.\" [[11]](#_edn11) Jennings' meaning was that, although he at the time did not know what was going on---that the firefighters ran away the first time because the South Tower came down and then", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:008__hessjenningswtc7explosiontvbroadcast.txt:2:affa07a76d22", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 6680, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "008__hessjenningswtc7explosiontvbroadcast.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "008__hessjenningswtc7explosiontvbroadcast", "chunk_index": 3, "text": "the first tower fell.

That's how he knew, when he was giving this testimony, that the Twin Towers had still been standing when the explosion occurred that knocked the landing out from under him. Jennings even repeated this explanation, saying: \"When I got to the 6th floor, there was an explosion. That's what forced us back to the 8th floor. Both buildings were still standing. Keep in mind, I told you the fire department came and ran. They came twice. Why? Because Building Tower One fell, then Tower Two fell.\" [[12]](#_edn12) Jennings' statement provides strong evidence against NIST's timeline, according to which the event that both Hess and Jennings had called \"an explosion\" was really simply an effect of debris striking WTC 7 when the North Tower collapsed at 10:28. The strongest evidence against NIST's timeline, however, is Hess's interview with UPN 9 News. Defenders of the official account, according to which there were no explosions in WTC 7, might challenge the truth of Jennings' testimony. But if Hess was giving an interview almost a half mile away before noon, then NIST's timeline, according to which the two men were not rescued until after noon, is objectively disproved. Given the fact that this interview occurred several blocks from WTC 7, it would probably have taken Hess close to half an hour to get there after he was rescued. So if the interview began at 11:57, he and Jennings must have been rescued by about 11:30. NIST's explanation for the event that Hess and Jennings took to be a massive explosion in WTC 7, therefore, cannot be true. If the two men were rescued by about 11:30 after they had been trapped for about an hour and a half (as Hess said), the event must have occurred at least by 10:00. In fact, it must have occurred earlier still, because Jennings stated, as we saw, that after the explosion occurred and he and Hess made it back up to the 8th floor, both towers were still standing. The South Tower collapsed at 9:59, so the event that Hess and Jennings called an explosion had to have happened before 9:59.

The South Tower collapsed at 9:59, so the event that Hess and Jennings called an explosion had to have happened before 9:59. Therefore, the event could not, contrary to NIST, have been the collapse of the North Tower, because this collapse did not occur until 10:28. NIST's claim, nevertheless, would be repeated by the BBC. A BBC special on WTC 7, entitled \"The Conspiracy Files: 9/11--The Third Tower,\" which aired July 6, 2008, contained material from an interview that Jennings granted the BBC. But the BBC's presentation distorted Jennings' testimony. Although he evidently told the BBC interviewer the same story he had earlier told to the makers of \"Loose Change Final Cut,\" the BBC placed his testimony within the time framework suggested by NIST. So, in conjunction with footage in which Jennings described a massive explosion in WTC 7---which would have occurred some time between 9:03, when the South Tower was struck, and 9:59, when it came down---the BBC narrator said: \"At 10:28, the North Tower collapses. . . . Tower 7 takes a direct hit. . . . Early evidence of explosives were just debris from a falling skyscraper.\" [[13]](#_edn13) Jennings, however, will not be available to correct the record. Although only 53 years old, Jennings reportedly died on August 19, 2008, two days before NIST issued its report on WTC 7. [[14]](#_edn14) After Jennings' death, moreover, the BBC put out a second version of its program on WTC 7, this one entitled \"The Conspiracy Files: 9/11--The Truth Behind the Third Tower.\" [[15]](#_edn15) This version contains an interview with Michael Hess, who did not appear in the first version and was, in fact, not even mentioned. In this second version, Hess endorsed the position taken by NIST and the BBC. Saying that he had, on 9/11, \"assumed that there had been an explosion in the basement,\" he claimed: \"I know now this was caused by the northern half of Number 1 [the North Tower] falling on the southern half of our building.\" [[16]](#_edn16) In *The Mysterious Collapse of World Trade Center 7: Why the Final Official Report about 9/11 Is Unscientific and False*, I have given many reasons why Hess's new story is not credible. The most obvious of these reasons, however, is simply the fact that Hess was giving an interview several blocks away by 11:57, after having been trapped in this building for at least an hour and a half. The event in question could not, therefore, have occurred as late as 10:28. **Important Note:** To see the UPN interview with Michael Hess, go to minute 57 of the video [available here](https://www.personalgrowthcourses.net/video/9-11_what_really_happened).

Barack Obama at Café Baci, a small coffee joint in Chicago, to interview him exclusively about his spirituality. Our conversation took place a few days after he'd clinched the Democratic nomination for the U.S. Senate seat that he eventually won. We spoke for more than an hour. He came alone. He answered everything I asked without notes or hesitation. The profile of Obama that grew from that interview became the first in a series in the [Sun-Times](http://www.suntimes.com/) called \"The God Factor,\" that eventually became my first book, [The God Factor: Inside the Spiritual Lives of Public People](http://www.amazon.com/God-Factor-Inside-Spiritual-Public/dp/0374530920?tag=wanttinfo-20). Because of the staggering interest in Obama's faith and spiritual predilections, I thought it might be helpful to share that interview here. ------------------- Interview with State Sen. Barack Obama Saturday March 27, 3:30 p.m. Cafe Baci, 330 S. Michigan Avenue Me: decaf He: alone, on time, grabs a Naked juice protein shake GG: What do you believe? OBAMA: I am a Christian. So, I have a deep faith. I draw from the Christian faith. On the other hand, I was born in Hawaii where obviously there are a lot of Eastern influences. I lived in Indonesia, the largest Muslim country in the world, between the ages of six and 10. My father was from Kenya, and although he was probably most accurately labeled an agnostic, his father was Muslim. And I'd say, probably, intellectually I've drawn as much from Judaism as any other faith. (A patron stops and says, \"Congratulations,\" shakes his hand. \"Thank you very much. I appreciate that. Thank you.\") So, I'm rooted in the Christian tradition. I believe that there are many paths to the same place, and that there is a higher power, that we are connected as a people. There are values that transcend race or culture that move us forward, and there's an obligation for all of us individually as well as collectively to take", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:008__obama_religious_beliefs_views.txt:0:8020d0e6e85f", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 6685, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "008__obama_religious_beliefs_views.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "008__obama_religious_beliefs_views", "chunk_index": 1, "text": "any other faith. (A patron stops and says, \"Congratulations,\" shakes his hand. \"Thank you very much. I appreciate that. Thank you.\") So, I'm rooted in the Christian tradition. I believe that there are many paths to the same place, and that there is a higher power, that we are connected as a people. There are values that transcend race or culture that move us forward, and there's an obligation for all of us individually as well as collectively to take responsibility to make those values lived. And so, part of my project in life was to spend the first 40 years of my life figuring out what I did believe - I'm 42 now. And it's not that I had it all completely worked out, but I'm spending a lot of time now trying to apply what I believe and trying to live up to those values. GG: Have you always been a Christian? OBAMA: I was raised more by my mother, and my mother was Christian. GG: Any particular flavor? OBAMA: No. My grandparents were from small towns in Kansas. My grandmother was Methodist. My grandfather was Baptist. And by the time I was born, I think, my grandparents had joined a Universalist church. My mother, who I think had as much influence on my values as anybody, was not someone who wore her religion on her sleeve. We'd go to church for Easter. She wasn't a church lady. As I said, we moved to Indonesia. She remarried an Indonesian who wasn't a practicing Muslim. I went to a Catholic school in a Muslim country. So I was studying the Bible and catechisms by day, and at night you'd hear the prayer call. I don't think as a child I had a structured religious education. But my mother was a deeply spiritual person. She would spend a lot of time talking about values and give me books about the world's religions, and talk to me about them. And I think always, her view was that underlying these religions were a common set of beliefs about how you treat other people and how you aspire to act not just for yourself, but also for the greater good. And, so that, I think, was what I carried with me through college. I didn't start getting active in church activities until I moved to Chicago. The way I came to Chicago in 1985 was that I was interested in community organizing. I was inspired by the Civil Rights movement and the idea that ordinary people could do extraordinary things. And there was a group of churches out on the South Side of Chicago that had come together to form an organization to try to deal with the devastation of steel plants that had closed. They didn't have much money, but felt that if they formed an organization and hired somebody to organize", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:008__obama_religious_beliefs_views.txt:1:c3bc6d972932", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 6686, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "008__obama_religious_beliefs_views.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "008__obama_religious_beliefs_views", "chunk_index": 2, "text": "1985 was that I was interested in community organizing.

And there was a group of churches out on the South Side of Chicago that had come together to form an organization to try to deal with the devastation of steel plants that had closed. They didn't have much money, but felt that if they formed an organization and hired somebody to organize them to work on issues that affected their community, that would strengthen the church and also strengthen the community. So they hired me, for $13,000 a year. A princely sum. And I drove out here and I didn't know anybody and started working with both the ministers and the lay people in these churches on issues like creating job training programs, or afterschool programs for youth, or making sure that city services were fairly allocated to underserved communities. And it was in those places where I think what had been more of an intellectual view of religion deepened, because I'd be spending an enormous amount of time with church ladies, sort of surrogate mothers and fathers. Everybody I was working with was 50 or 55 or 60, and here I was a 23-year-old kid running around. I became much more familiar with the ongoing tradition of the historic black church and it's importance in the community, and the power of that culture to give people strength in very difficult circumstances, and the power of that church to give people courage against great odds. And it moved me deeply. One of the churches that I became involved in was Trinity United Church of Christ. And the pastor there, Jeremiah Wright, became a good friend. So I joined that church and committed myself to Christ in that church. GG: Did you actually go up for an altar call? OBAMA: Yes. Absolutely. It was during a daytime service. And it was a powerful moment. It was powerful for me because it not only confirmed my faith, it not only gave shape to my faith, but I think, also, allowed me to connect the work I had been pursuing with my faith. GG: How long ago? OBAMA: 16, 17 years ago. 1987 or 88 GG: So you got yourself born again? OBAMA: Yeah, although I retain from my childhood and my experiences growing up a suspicion of dogma. And I'm not somebody who is always comfortable with language that implies I've got a monopoly on the truth, or that my faith is automatically transferable to others. I'm a big believer in tolerance. I think that religion at it's best comes with a big dose of doubt. I'm suspicious of too much certainty in the pursuit of understanding just because I think people are limited in their understanding.

I think that - particularly as somebody who's now in the public realm and is a student of what brings people together and what drives them apart - there's an enormous amount of damage done around the world in the name of religion and certainty. GG: Do you pray often? OBAMA: Uh, yeah, I guess I do. Its' not formal, me getting on my knees. I have an ongoing conversation with God. Throughout the day I'm constantly asking myself questions about what I'm doing, why am I doing it. One of the interesting things about being in public life is there are constantly these pressures being placed on you from different sides. To be effective, you have to be able to listen to a variety of points of view. You also have to know when to be just a strong advocate, and when to push back against certain people or views that you think aren't right or don't serve your constituents. The biggest challenge, I think, is always maintaining your moral compass. Those are the conversations I'm having internally. I'm measuring my actions against that inner voice that for me is audible, is active. It tells me where I think I'm on track and where I'm off track. I always think of politics as having two sides. There's a vanity aspect to politics, and then there's a substantive part of politics. Now you need some sizzle with the steak to be effective, but I think it's easy to get swept up in the vanity side of it, the desire to be liked and recognized and important. It's important for me throughout the day to measure and to take stock and to say, \"Now am I doing this because I think it's advantageous to me politically, or because I think it's the right thing to do? Am I doing this to get my name in the papers or am I doing this because it's necessary to accomplish my motives?\" GG: Checking for altruism? OBAMA: Yeah. I mean, something like it. It's interesting, the most powerful political moments for me come when I feel like my actions are aligned with a certain truth. I can feel it. When I'm talking to a group and I'm saying something truthful, I can feel a power that comes out of those statements that is different than when I'm just being glib or clever. GG: What's that power? Is it the holy spirit?", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:008__obama_religious_beliefs_views.txt:3:a05512e3d240", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 6688, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "008__obama_religious_beliefs_views.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "008__obama_religious_beliefs_views", "chunk_index": 4, "text": "motives?\" GG: Checking for altruism?

When I'm talking to a group and I'm saying something truthful, I can feel a power that comes out of those statements that is different than when I'm just being glib or clever. GG: What's that power? Is it the holy spirit? God? OBAMA: Well, I think it's the power of the recognition of God, or the recognition of a larger truth that is being shared between me and an audience. That's something you learn watching ministers. What they call the Holy Spirit. They want the Holy Spirit to come down before they're preaching, right? Not to try to intellectualize it, but what I see is there are moments that happen within a sermon where the minister gets out of his ego and is speaking from a deeper source. And it's powerful. There are also times when you can see the ego getting in the way, where the minister is performing and clearly straining for applause or an Amen. And those are distinct moments. I think those former moments are sacred. GG: Who's Jesus to you? (He laughs nervously) OBAMA: Right. Jesus is an historical figure for me. And he's also a bridge between God and man, in the Christian faith, and one that I think is powerful precisely because he serves as that means of us reaching something higher. And he's also a wonderful teacher. I think it's important for all of us, of whatever faith, to have teachers in the flesh and also teachers in history. GG: Is Jesus someone who you feel you have a regular connection with now, a personal connection with in your life? OBAMA: Yes. I think some of the things I talked about earlier are channeled through my Christian faith and a personal relationship with Jesus Christ. GG: Have you read the bible? OBAMA: Absolutely. I read it not as regularly as I would like. These days I don't have much time for reading or reflection, period. GG: Do you try to take some time for whatever, meditation, prayer reading? OBAMA: I'll be honest with you. I used to all the time, in a fairly disciplined way. But during the course of this campaign, I don't. And I probably need to and would like to, but that's where that internal monologue, or dialogue I think supplants my opportunity to read and reflect in a structured way these days. It's much more sort of as I'm going through the day trying to take a moment here and a moment there to take stock. Why am I here, how does this connect with a larger sense of purpose?

GG: Jack Ryan [Obama's Republican opponent in the U.S. Senate race at the time] said talking about your faith is fraught with peril for a public figure. OBAMA: Which is why you generally will not see me spending a lot of time talking about it on the stump. **Alongside my own deep personal faith, I am a follower, as well, of our civic religion. I am a big believer in the separation of church and state. I am a big believer in our constitutional structure. I mean, I'm a law professor at the University of Chicago teaching constitutional law. I am a great admirer of our founding charter, and its resolve to prevent theocracies from forming, and its resolve to prevent disruptive strains of fundamentalism from taking root in this country.** I'm very suspicious of religious certainty expressing itself in politics. Now, that's different from a belief that values have to inform our public policy. I think it's perfectly consistent to say that I want my government to be operating for all faiths and all peoples, including atheists and agnostics, while also insisting that there are values that inform my politics that are appropriate to talk about. A standard line in my stump speech during this campaign is that my politics are informed by a belief that we're all connected. That if there's a child on the South Side of Chicago that can't read, that makes a difference in my life, even if it's not my own child. If there's a senior citizen in downstate Illinois that's struggling to pay for their medicine and having to chose between medicine and the rent, that makes my life poorer, even if it's not my grandparent. And if there's an Arab American family that's being rounded up by John Ashcroft without the benefit of due process, that threatens my civil liberties. I can give religious expression to that. I am my brother's keeper, I am my sister's keeper, we are all children of God. Or I can express it in secular terms. But the basic premise remains the same. I think sometimes Democrats have made the mistake of shying away from a conversation about values for fear that they sacrifice the important value of tolerance. And I don't think those two things are mutually exclusive. GG: Do you think it's wrong for people to want to know about a civic leader's spirituality? OBAMA: I don't' think it's wrong.

And I don't think those two things are mutually exclusive. GG: Do you think it's wrong for people to want to know about a civic leader's spirituality? OBAMA: I don't' think it's wrong. I think that political leaders are subject to all sorts of vetting by the public, and this can be a component of that. I think there is an enormous danger on the part of public figures to rationalize or justify their actions by claiming God's mandate. I think there is this tendency that I don't think is healthy for public figures to wear religion on their sleeve as a means to insulate themselves from criticism. GG: The conversation stopper, when you say you're a Christian and leave it at that. OBAMA: Where do you move forward with that? This is something that I'm sure I'd have serious debates with my fellow Christians about. I think that the difficult thing about any religion, including Christianity, is that at some level there is a call to evangelize and proselytize. There's the belief, certainly in some quarters, that people who haven't embraced Jesus Christ as their personal savior, that they're going to hell. GG You don't believe that? OBAMA: I find it hard to believe that my God would consign four-fifths of the world to hell. I can't imagine that my God would allow some little Hindu kid in India who never interacts with the Christian faith to somehow burn for all eternity. That's just not part of my religious makeup. Part of the reason I think it's always difficult for public figures to talk about this is that the nature of politics is that you want to have everybody like you and project the best possible traits onto you. Oftentimes that's by being as vague as possible, or appealing to the lowest common denominators. The more specific and detailed you are on issues as personal and fundamental as your faith, the more potentially dangerous it is. GG: Do you ever have people who know you're a Christian question a particular stance you take on an issue? How can you be a Christian and ...? OBAMA: I haven't been challenged in those direct ways. And to that extent, I give the public a lot of credit. I'm always struck by how much common sense the American people have. They get confused sometimes, watch Fox News or listen to talk radio. That's dangerous sometimes. But generally, Americans are tolerant, and I think recognize that faith is a personal thing.

That's dangerous sometimes. But generally, Americans are tolerant, and I think recognize that faith is a personal thing. They may feel very strongly about an issue like abortion or gay marriage, but if they discuss it with me as an elected official they will discuss it with me in those terms and not say, 'you call yourself a Christian.' I cannot recall that ever happening. GG: Do you believe in heaven? OBAMA: Do I believe in the harps and clouds and wings? GG: A place spiritually you go to after you die? OBAMA: What I believe in is that if I live my life as well as I can, I will be rewarded. I don't presume to have knowledge of what happens after I die. But I feel very strongly that whether the reward is in the here and now or in the hereafter, aligning myself to my faith and my values is a good thing. When I tuck in my daughters at night and I feel like I've been a good father to them, and I see in them that I am transferring values that I got from my mother, and that they're kind people and that they're honest people and they're curious people, that's a little piece of heaven. GG: Do you believe in sin? OBAMA: Yes. GG: What is sin? OBAMA: Being out of alignment with my values. GG: What happens if you have sin in your life? OBAMA: I think it's the same thing as the question about heaven. If I'm true to myself and my faith, that is its own reward. When I'm not true to it, that's its own punishment. GG: Where do you find spiritual inspiration? Music, nature, literature, people, a conduit you plug into? OBAMA: There are so many. Nothing is more powerful than the black church experience. A good choir and a good sermon in the black church, it's pretty hard not to be move and be transported. I can also be transported by watching a good performance of Hamlet, or reading Toni Morrison's Song of Solomon, or listening to Miles Davis. GG: Is there something you go back to as a touchstone, a book, a particular piece of music, a place... OBAMA: As I said before, in my own sort of mental library, the Civil Rights movement has a powerful hold on me. It's a point in time where I think heaven and earth meet.

Because it's a moment in which a collective faith transforms everything. So when I read Gandhi or I read King or I read certain passages of Abraham Lincoln, and I think about those times where people's values are tested, those inspire me. GG: What are you doing when you feel the most centered, the most aligned spiritually? OBAMA: I think I already described it. **It's when I'm being true to myself. And that can happen in me making a speech or it can happen in me playing with my kids, or it can happen in a small interaction with a security guard in a building when I'm recognizing them and exchanging a good word.** GG: Is there someone you would look to as an example of how not to do it? OBAMA: Bin Laden. (grins broadly) GG: ... An example of a role model, who combined everything you said you want to do in your life, and your faith? OBAMA: I think Gandhi is a great example of a profoundly spiritual man who acted and risked everything on behalf of those values but never slipped into intolerance or dogma. He seemed to always maintain an air of doubt about him. I also think of Dr. King, and Lincoln. Those three are good examples for me of people who applied their faith to a larger canvas without allowing that faith to metastasize into something that is hurtful. ** **Final Note:** **Thanks for your interest in Obama's religious views.

The passengers could be a group of college students off on a holiday. An aircraft at Eglin AFB would be painted and numbered as an exact duplicate for a civil registered aircraft belonging to a CIA proprietary organization in the Miami area. At the designated time the duplicate would be substituted for the actual civil aircraft and would be loaded with selected passengers, all boarded under carefully prepared aliases. The actual aircraft would be converted to a drone. The drone aircraft and the actual aircraft will be scheduled to allow a rendezvous south of Florida. From the rendezvous point the passenger-carrying aircraft will descend to minimum altitude and go directly into an auxiliary field at Eglin AFB where arrangements will have been made to evacuate the passengers and return the aircraft to its original status. The drone aircraft meanwhile will continue to fly the filed flight plan. When over Cuba the drone will be transmitting on the international distress frequency a \"MAY DAY\" message stating he is under attack by Cuban MIG aircraft. The transmission will be interrupted by destruction of the aircraft which will be triggered by radio signal. **What We Can Do** **Remember that many government and military leaders think of this like a chess game.

UFO Believers Sighted Here! *Joel Achenbach* May 10, 2001 A group of people who believe in UFOs held a news conference yesterday morning that established beyond the shadow of a doubt -- that reached levels of credibility so high as to constitute actual proof -- that there really do exist people who believe in UFOs. This was the big day for the [Disclosure Project](https://www.WantToKnow.info/ufocover-up10pg), an attempt to incite the government to admit that unidentified flying objects are piloted by creatures from another world. The organizer, Steven Greer, a Charlottesville emergency room physician, announced that this was a moment of historic, indeed planetary, significance: \"This is the end of the childhood of the human race. It is time for us to become mature adults among the cosmic civilizations that are out there.\" He arranged an impressive venue, the main ballroom of the National Press Club. Upward of a hundred people were there, along with more than a dozen TV cameras. At a long table up front sat 20 witnesses, most of them gray-haired men who'd served in the military. As they took turns at the microphone, it quickly became apparent that this was a rather old-fashioned event -- a return to the fundamentals of ufology, the discussion of aerial anomalies. At one point a witness flashed two black-and-white photos of a saucer- shaped craft. The tales were set, for the most part, in the '40s, '50s and '60s; there was no talk of alien abductions, or an alien- human hybridization program, or the implantation of alien fetuses, or any of those extremely intimate Close Encounters that have dominated the UFO mythology in recent years. These guys were from the hardware wing of the movement. They'd seen things in the sky they couldn't explain and that suggested, to their minds, extraterrestrial visitors. They'd seen objects. Lights. Radar blips moving at extraordinary speed. What they didn't see, in almost every case, were any actual aliens. Only one witness, Clifford Stone, a retired Army sergeant, told of having directly seen aliens. He'd seen them both dead and alive at the scenes of crashed saucers. Asked if he could describe their appearance,", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:010510washingtonpostufos.txt:0:5ef88b5f5390", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 6704, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "010510washingtonpostufos.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "010510washingtonpostufos", "chunk_index": 1, "text": "the hardware wing of the movement.

He'd seen them both dead and alive at the scenes of crashed saucers. Asked if he could describe their appearance, he said, \"I could, but it would probably take a whole lot of time.\" He did stipulate that there are 57 alien species, including three types of \"grays.\" Many aliens are humanoid, and, indeed, are indistinguishable from members of our own species. Some can touch an object in a dark room and tell its color. There were a few other unverified bombshells. One speaker claimed that George Bush the elder, when director of the Central Intelligence Agency, refused to give newly inaugurated President Carter the top- secret files on UFOs. Greer, meanwhile, assured the audience that the military has already developed spacecraft that can travel faster than the speed of light. The Disclosure Project is part of a long -- and so far unsuccessful -- effort to incite congressional hearings on the UFO issue. Greer says he has conducted interviews with 400 people with intimate knowledge of the alien phenomenon and the government \"coverup.\" Many, he claimed, are afraid to come forward without congressional immunity. \"We know lethal force has been used to keep this secret,\" he said. There was nothing presented at the news conference that could be considered forensic evidence. Instead, the audience heard what is known as the Argument from Authority. The evidence on the table was essentially in the form of re{acute}sume{acute}s. The witnesses vouched for their credibility and said they'd like to tell their stories to Congress. Maybe that's not as impressive as someone coming forward with an actual alien tentacle, but you have to start somewhere. If nothing else, this was an interesting glimpse of the corrosive side effects of government secrecy. The witnesses have been burdened by suspicion for decades. Some said they were told by superiors to stay silent about what they'd seen. \"Such things do exist. Please believe me,\" said retired Air Force Lt. Col. Charles L. Brown, who once analyzed UFO sightings and saw, just two years ago, \"two inexplicable objects.\" Graham Bethune, a retired Navy pilot, told of seeing a glow near Iceland that turned into a circle of lights with a dome. This was 1951. He's ready to testify under oath. Robert Salas, a retired Air Force captain, said a \"bright, glowing red object\" hovered outside the gate of a nuclear weapons site in Montana in 1967. The weapons suddenly went into a \"no go\" condition. Did the aliens disable them?

The weapons suddenly went into a \"no go\" condition. Did the aliens disable them? The UFO narrative has innumerable subplots, some of which emerged yesterday. There are people who believe that the Bush administration wants to build a missile defense shield as part of its covert war with the aliens. There is a rumor that Big Oil wants to suppress knowledge of a secret, stunning energy source that can be harvested from the quantum soup all around us. If we know the truth about the aliens, our energy crisis will be solved. \"It will cause such vast and profound changes on this planet that there is nothing to equal it in human history,\" Greer said. Who's running this coverup? Greer said that's a complex matter. He said there are compartmentalized elements of a secret government operation in multiple intelligence and defense agencies and throughout corporate America. The bad guys are everywhere. We live in a world of lies. (Are you sure the Apollo astronauts really went to the moon, and not just to a Hollywood back lot?) Scientists who work on \"exobiology\" endure the stigma of being experts in a field with no known subject matter. They'd be thrilled beyond words to find a tiny fragment of alien life. They'd like to know if extraterrestrial life is carbon-based, if it uses oxygen in its metabolism, if it stores genetic information in the form of the DNA molecule. They'd like to know the evolutionary history of an alien biosphere, so they could compare it to the history of life on Earth. Now we hear that all the scientists need to do is start poking around in government freezers. When the news conference was over, rational observers were faced with two scenarios: Intelligent creatures have piloted spaceships across trillions of miles to visit our planet. They have the ability to elude detection by scientific investigators and mainstream news organizations, but have also been seen by thousands of people. Secret forces within our government have masterfully covered up the alien presence for half a century, although sometimes the coverup is imperfect, which is why, at Safeway, you can buy Chef Boy-ar-dee Flying Saucers & Aliens canned pasta.

All that matters is that you line up as an ally in the drug war, the only international cause that this nation still takes seriously. **That's the message sent with the recent gift of $43 million to the Taliban rulers of Afghanistan, the most virulent anti-American violators of human rights in the world today. The gift, announced last Thursday by Secretary of State Colin Powell, in addition to other recent aid, makes the U.S. the main sponsor of the Taliban and rewards that \"rogue regime\" for declaring that opium growing is against the will of God.** So, too, by the Taliban's estimation, are most human activities, but it's the ban on drugs that catches this administration's attention. Never mind that Osama bin Laden still operates the leading anti-American terror operation from his base in Afghanistan, from which, among other crimes, he launched two bloody attacks on American embassies in Africa in 1998. Sadly, the Bush administration is cozying up to the Taliban regime at a time when the United Nations, at U.S. insistence, imposes sanctions on Afghanistan because the Kabul government will not turn over Bin Laden. The war on drugs has become our own fanatics' obsession and easily trumps all other concerns. How else could we come to reward the Taliban, who has subjected the female half of the Afghan population to a continual reign of terror in a country once considered enlightened in its treatment of women? At no point in modern history have women and girls been more systematically abused than in Afghanistan where, in the name of madness masquerading as Islam, the government in Kabul obliterates their fundamental human rights. Women may not appear in public without being covered from head to toe with the oppressive shroud called the *burkha* , and they may not leave the house without being accompanied by a male family member.

They've not been permitted to attend school or be treated by male doctors, yet women have been banned from practicing medicine or any profession for that matter. The lot of males is better if they blindly accept the laws of an extreme religious theocracy that prescribes strict rules governing all behavior, from a ban on shaving to what crops may be grown. It is this last power that has captured the enthusiasm of the Bush White House. The Taliban fanatics, economically and diplomatically isolated, are at the breaking point, and so, in return for a pittance of legitimacy and cash from the Bush administration, they have been willing to appear to reverse themselves on the growing of opium. That a totalitarian country can effectively crack down on its farmers is not surprising. But it is grotesque for a U.S. official, James P. Callahan, director of the State Department's Asian anti-drug program, to describe the Taliban's special methods in the language of representative democracy: \"The Taliban used a system of consensus-building,\" Callahan said after a visit with the Taliban, adding that the Taliban justified the ban on drugs \"in very religious terms.\" Of course, Callahan also reported, those who didn't obey the theocratic edict would be sent to prison. In a country where those who break minor rules are simply beaten on the spot by religious police and others are stoned to death, it's understandable that the government's \"religious\" argument might be compelling. Even if it means, as Callahan concedes, that most of the farmers who grew the poppies will now confront starvation. That's because the Afghan economy has been ruined by the religious extremism of the Taliban, making the attraction of opium as a previously tolerated quick cash crop overwhelming. For that reason, the opium ban will not last unless the U.S. is willing to pour far larger amounts of money into underwriting the Afghan economy. As the Drug Enforcement Administration's Steven Casteel admitted, \"The bad side of the ban is that it's bringing their country--or certain regions of their country--to economic ruin.\" Nor did he hold out much hope for Afghan farmers growing other crops such as wheat, which require a vast infrastructure to supply water and fertilizer that no longer exists in that devastated country. There's little doubt that the Taliban will turn once again to the easily taxed cash crop of opium in order to stay in power.

Our long sad history of signing up dictators in the war on drugs demonstrates the futility of building a foreign policy on a domestic obsession. - - - *Robert Scheer Is a Syndicated Columnist. * **Copyright © 2001 Robert Scheer** FAIR USE NOTICE: This site contains copyrighted material the use of which has not always been specifically authorized by the copyright owner.

Purpose. These instructions constitute actions to be taken by the DDO, NMCC, unified commanders, and the Commander, NORAD, in the event of a civil and military aircraft piracy (hijacking) incident. 2. Coordination with Civil Authorities a. When an aircraft becomes the subject of an aircraft piracy offense within the US special aircraft jurisdiction, the FAA and the Department Defense will provide support in accordance with paragraph 3 of this enclosure. In addition, for military aircraft and military contract aircraft, the Department of Defense will take action to prevent the hijacking attempt and promptly notify the FAA and appropriate federal agencies. The Department of Defense will provide the FAA with all pertinent information involving onboard documents, equipment, weapons of mass destruction (WMD), or material that the Department of Defense has determined to be highly sensitive. b. When the aircraft piracy (hijacking) situation is outside of the special aircraft jurisdiction, the Department of Defense will take appropriate action, consistent with Federal law and applicable status of forces and other international agreements. c. The DDO, NMCC, and FAA will maintain coordination during the aircraft piracy situation. 3. Procedures a. General. Military personnel will provide the following types of support: intercept, surveillance, lift, equipment, and communications. Military personnel may not participate in a search, seizure, arrest, or other similar activity. This restriction would include the apprehension of aircraft hijackers or use of military aircraft (fixed-wing or helicopter) or other vehicles as platforms for gunfire or the use of other weapons against suspected hijackers. In addition, assistance may not be provided under this enclosure if it could adversely affect national security or military preparedness. CJCSI 3610.01A 1 June 2001 Enclosure A A-2 b. Support.

This restriction would include the apprehension of aircraft hijackers or use of military aircraft (fixed-wing or helicopter) or other vehicles as platforms for gunfire or the use of other weapons against suspected hijackers. In addition, assistance may not be provided under this enclosure if it could adversely affect national security or military preparedness. CJCSI 3610.01A 1 June 2001 Enclosure A A-2 b. Support. When notified that military assistance is needed in conjunction with an aircraft piracy (hijacking) emergency, the DDO, NMCC, will: (1) Determine whether or not the assistance needed is reasonably available from police or commercial sources. If not, the DDO, NMCC, will notify the appropriate unified command or NORAD to determine if suitable assets are available and will forward the request to the Secretary of Defense for approval in accordance with DODD 3025.15, paragraph D.7 (reference d). (2) If suitable assets from a unified command or NORAD are not reasonably available, the DDO, NMCC, will coordinate with the appropriate Military Service operations center to provide military assistance. c. Military Escort Aircraft (1) When notified that military escort aircraft are needed in conjunction with an aircraft piracy (hijacking) emergency, the DDO, NMCC, will notify the appropriate unified command or USELEMNORAD to determine if suitable aircraft are available and forward the request to the Secretary of Defense for approval in accordance with DODD 3025.15, paragraph D.7 (reference d). (2) Pursuant to reference j, the escort service will be requested by the FAA hijack coordinator by direct contact with the NMCC. Normally, NORAD escort aircraft will take the required action. However, for the purpose of these procedures, the term \"escort aircraft\" applies to any military aircraft assigned to the escort mission. When the military can provide escort aircraft, the NMCC will advise the FAA hijack coordinator of the identification and location of the squadron tasked to provide escort aircraft. NMCC will then authorize direct coordination between FAA and the designated military unit. When a NORAD resource is tasked, FAA will coordinate through the appropriate Air Defense Sector/Regional Air Operations Center. (3) If the hijacked aircraft destination is Cuba, flight-following aircraft will maintain surveillance in case an emergency occurs over international waters and will notify USSOUTHCOM or NORAD immediately of any action taken. USSOUTHCOM or the Commander, USELEMNORAD, may terminate any escort activities south of 24N whenever appropriate to avoid Cuban airspace. For all foreign countries, including Cuba, flight-following aircraft should break away before entering the US-recognized territorial airspace of another country (or the land border if the other country is contiguous to the United States) and CJCSI 3610.01A 1 June 2001 Enclosure A A-3 await overflight clearance as necessary.

Purpose. These instructions provide the Services, unified commands, and USELEMNORAD with the basic procedural guidance for preventing and resisting attempts to hijack military and military contract aircraft. This includes all civil aircraft while wholly and exclusively supporting the Services under contract, charter, or other arrangements. 2. Policy. DOD policy (references e, f, and g) outlines general procedures and authority of military commanders to protect and secure property under their command and deal with terrorism and provides information for reducing the vulnerability of DOD personnel, their family members, facilities, and materiel to acts of terrorism. 3. Preventive Measures a. The Services, unified commands, and USELEMNORAD will take measures designed to prevent unauthorized possession of weapons, explosives, or incendiary devices aboard aircraft. b. Through the use of training, briefings, and other means, all travelers will be reminded that: (1) Carrying weapons, explosives, or incendiary devices aboard military or military contract aircraft is prohibited, except when authorized by proper authority. (2) Passengers and baggage are subject to inspection as a condition of travel. c. A passenger screening process will be established to ensure positive identification of travelers and authenticity of travel documents. Personnel engaged in passenger processing and surveillance activities will be instructed to watch for and report any discrepancies, particularly the possible unauthorized possession of weapons, explosives, or incendiary devices. d. Passengers and baggage accessible in flight will be inspected. All baggage will be screened as thoroughly as available resources permit (X-ray, explosive detector dogs, etc.) and will be accompanied by a boarding passenger. When inspection indicates cause for suspicion, a CJCSI 3610.01A 1 June 2001 Enclosure B B-2 complete examination of the suspected person and accompanying baggage is mandatory. e. Screening procedures will take into account the travel status of passengers. Neuropsychiatric patients, military prisoners, and emotionally disturbed personnel require special vigilance. f. The Services, unified commands, and USELEMNORAD will intensify security programs to prevent unauthorized access to aircraft by hijackers who bypass the passenger processing system. Military agencies administering airlift contracts with civil air carriers operating at civil airfields will consult with appropriate authorities to ensure mutually acceptable procedures for controlling access to the contract aircraft. 4. Resisting Aircraft Piracy a. The Services, unified commands, and USELEMNORAD will establish procedures to report any suspected or actual acts of aircraft piracy immediately to the NMCC. b.

Resisting Aircraft Piracy a. The Services, unified commands, and USELEMNORAD will establish procedures to report any suspected or actual acts of aircraft piracy immediately to the NMCC. b. When an act of air piracy involves a military installation, military aircraft, or military contract aircraft, the response should be according to the following guidelines until the FAA assumes active direction of efforts to regain control of the hijacked aircraft: (1) Any attempt to hijack a military aircraft will be resisted. Resistance may range from simple discussion through deception and subterfuge to direct physical confrontation, including the prudent use of weapons or deadly force. (2) If practicable, aircraft movement will be delayed to allow time for ground personnel and the aircrew to establish communication and execute coordinated resistance actions. Aircrews faced with an aircraft piracy (hijacking) threat will notify ground agencies by any means available as soon as practicable and will follow up with situation reports, when possible. (3) The Chiefs of the Services and CINCs will identify in their planning documents the levels of command authorized to discontinue delaying actions (e.g., installation commander, senior officer on scene). Within this authorization, the commander at the highest available level will determine whether delaying actions should be discontinued. CJCSI 3610.01A 1 June 2001 Enclosure B B-3 (4) Ground personnel will positively prevent takeoff when nuclear weapons are aboard the aircraft. The presence of hostages will not deter taking prompt, effective action, including the use of deadly force, to prevent unauthorized access or removal or to recover a WMD. c. The many variables of an aircraft piracy (hijacking) attempt preclude providing a specific counter hijacking procedure to be followed by aircrew. However, within the basic policy of resistance, the individual Services will identify and issue guidance to aircrews consistent with reference h. (1) Factors to be considered include the nature of the threat, imminent danger to the aircraft in flight, destination indicated by the hijacker(s), and the presence of sensitive material aboard the aircraft. (2) Some counter hijacking techniques the aircrew should consider are: (a) Convincing the hijacker(s) to discontinue the course of action. (b) Proposing more favorable alternatives, such as landing in a neutral rather than an unfriendly country. (c) Exploiting any reasonable opportunity to physically incapacitate or overcome the hijackers including the prudent use of firearms. Aircrews are authorized to make such an attempt if they consider that escape is their only hope. The aircrew must weigh carefully the unique circumstances of the terrorist situation and all aspects of a decision to attempt escape. See reference i.

These instructions constitute actions to be taken by the DDO, NMCC, unified commanders, and the Commander, USELEMNORAD, for destruction of derelict airborne objects. 2. Policy. This instruction provides guidance for the destruction of derelict objects (e.g., unmanned free balloons, moored balloons, kites, unmanned non-nuclear rockets or missiles, UAV or ROV) over United States or international airspace. a. For unmanned derelict airborne objects that become a hazard to domestic air navigation or a threat to domestic ground facilities or public safety, military personnel may be required to perform surveillance and/or destroy the unmanned derelict airborne object. b. Destruction of derelict airborne objects over foreign airspace requires a request or permission by the foreign government and approval by the Secretary of Defense. The DDO, NMCC, will be notified by the most expeditious means when control of an object is lost, if an object becomes a hazard to air navigation, or if the FAA (or another agency) desires the military to destroy the hazard. The notifications will be made by the FAA, NORAD, or the agency that has employed the object. 3. Procedures a. When notified of a derelict airborne object, the DDO, NMCC, will direct a derelict object conference and poll NORAD or the FAA for position, altitude, time, and fuel exhaustion, if available and applicable. b. The DDO, NMCC, will determine the appropriate unified command (or NORAD) capable of effecting destruction in the event destruction is subsequently required. c. If destruction is required, the DDO, NMCC will, forward all requests or proposals for DOD military assistance to the DOD Executive Secretary and appropriate OSD staff offices, and then to the Secretary of Defense for approval in accordance with DODD 3025.15, paragraph D.7 (reference d). CJCSI 3610.01A 1 June 2001 Enclosure C C-2 d. The DDO, NMCC, will notify the appropriate CINC or Service of execution instructions.

ESCORT OF HIJACKED AIRCRAFT** **Section 1. GENERAL** **7-1-1. PURPOSE** The FAA hijack coordinator (the Director or his designate of the FAA Office of Civil Aviation Security) on duty at Washington headquarters will request the military to provide an escort aircraft for a confirmed hijacked aircraft to: **a. **Assure positive flight following. **b. **Report unusual observances. **c. **Aid search and rescue in the event of an emergency. **7-1-2. REQUESTS FOR SERVICE** The escort service will be requested by the FAA hijack coordinator by direct contact with the National Military Command Center (NMCC). Normally, NORAD escort aircraft will take the required action. However, for the purpose of these procedures, the term \"escort aircraft\" applies to any military aircraft assigned to the escort mission. When the military can provide escort aircraft, the NMCC will advise the FAA hijack coordinator the identification and location of the squadron tasked to provide escort aircraft. NMCC will then authorize direct coordination between FAA and the designated military unit. When a NORAD resource is tasked, FAA will coordinate through the appropriate SOCC/ROCC. **7-1-3. HANDLING PRIORITY** When the situation requires an expedited departure of the escort aircraft, the aircraft shall be afforded priority consideration over other departing aircraft. **7-1-4. CONTROL RESPONSIBILITIES FOR U.S. AIRSPACE** **a. **When hijacked aircraft is within FAA radar coverage, escort aircraft shall be controlled by the appropriate FAA facility. **b. **When a hijacked aircraft is not within FAA radar coverage but within military radar coverage, escort aircraft may be controlled by the military for the escort phase only. **c. **When escort aircraft are under military control, separation between the escort aircraft/hijacked aircraft and other IFR traffic is the responsibility of the FAA. Separation shall be provided through the application of appropriate altitude reservations as required. **d. **When escort aircraft is under FAA control, standard air traffic control separation shall be applied. In no case shall any clearance or instruction to the aircraft compromise ATC standards. **e. **When tanker aircraft are employed, the designated tankers and escort aircraft shall be under FAA control, and appropriate aerial refueling procedures shall apply. **7-1-5. CONTROL RESPONSIBILITIES FOR CANADIAN AIRSPACE** Escort aircraft entering Canadian airspace from the U.S. shall be transferred to NORAD control in accordance with FAA/NORAD procedures prior to the aircraft entering Canadian airspace. Escort aircraft entering U.S. airspace from Canada will be transferred from NORAD control in the same manner when transfer of control is effected. When the hijacked aircraft is not within the coverage of the NORAD surveillance system in Canada, the escort mission will be discontinued. **7-1-6.

When the hijacked aircraft is not within the coverage of the NORAD surveillance system in Canada, the escort mission will be discontinued. **7-1-6. AIR/GROUND COMMUNICATIONS SECURITY** Except when specifically directed otherwise by FAA headquarters, every precaution shall be taken to prevent the hijacker/s from gaining knowledge that an escort is being conducted. When communicating with escort aircraft, ensure that transmissions are made on a different frequency from the one being used to communicate with the hijacked aircraft and are not simultaneously broadcast on a frequency which can be overheard by the hijacked aircraft. **7-1-7. WEATHER/FLIGHT SAFETY LIMITATIONS** If weather conditions or other flight safety factors make the escort mission impractical, the mission shall be terminated by the controller or the pilot, and the FAA headquarters hijack coordinator shall be advised immediately. The pilot of the escort aircraft will keep the controller advised of adverse weather or any other hazardous conditions. The pilot will immediately terminate the mission if radio contact with the control facility is lost, maintaining the last assigned altitude and/or radio failure procedures unless the pilot has received specific instructions to the contrary.

Raman The Financial Times (Asian edition) August 10, 2001 Pakistan's illegal heroin economy has kept its legitimate State economy sustained since 1990 and prevented its collapse. It has also enabled it to maintain a high level of arms purchases from abroad and to finance its proxy war against India through the jehadi organisations. While no estimate of the money spent by it on its proxy war is available, it has been estimated by Pakistani analysts (\"Friday Times\" March 9 to 15, 2001) that about 80 per cent of its total external debt of US $ 38 billion, that is, about US $30.4 billion, was incurred on arms purchases since 1990. This includes its purchases of aircraft and missiles from China, missiles from North Korea, for which payment was made partly in cash and partly in imported US and Australian wheat, Agosta class submarines from France, reconditioned Mirage aircraft from France, Lebanon and Australia and other items from countries such as Ukraine. The clandestine procurement of nuclear technology and material from Western countries and the Chinese-aided nuclear power station at Chashma were also financed through external borrowing. The use of the heroin dollars for such purposes started after the withdrawal of the Soviet troops from Afghanistan in 1989. In the 1980s, at the insistence of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) of the US, the Internal Political Division of the Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI), headed by Brig (retd). Imtiaz, who worked directly under Lt.Gen.Hamid Gul, the DG of the ISI during the later years of Zia-ul-Haq and during the first few months of Mrs. Benazir Bhutto's first tenure as the Prime Minister (1988-90), started a special cell for the use of heroin for covert actions. This cell promoted the cultivation of opium and the extraction of heroin in Pakistani territory as well as in the Afghan territory under Mujahideen control for being smuggled into the Soviet controlled areas in order to make the Soviet troops heroin addicts. After the withdrawal of the Soviet troops, the ISI's heroin cell started using its network of refineries and smugglers for smuggling heroin to the Western countries and using the money as a supplement to its legitimate economy. But for these heroin dollars, Pakistan's legitimate economy must have collapsed many years ago. Not only the legitimate State economy, but also many senior officers of the Army and the ISI benefited from the heroin dollars. Brig.Imtiaz was sacked by Mrs.Benazir on coming to power in 1988 for interfering in internal politics, but was reinstated by Mr.Nawaz Sharif on coming to power in 1990 and subsequently made Director of the Intelligence Bureau (IB). In fact, in Pakistan, Mr.Sharif is seen as the creation of Brig. Imtiaz. It was he who, as head of the Internal Political Division of the ISI in the 1980s, had persuaded Mr.Sharif, then a small", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:010810ft.isiheroin.txt:0:679970f642e5", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 6726, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "010810ft.isiheroin.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "010810ft.isiheroin", "chunk_index": 1, "text": "the ISI benefited from the heroin dollars. Brig.Imtiaz was sacked by Mrs.Benazir on coming to power in 1988 for interfering in internal politics, but was reinstated by Mr.Nawaz Sharif on coming to power in 1990 and subsequently made Director of the Intelligence Bureau (IB). In fact, in Pakistan, Mr.Sharif is seen as the creation of Brig. Imtiaz. It was he who, as head of the Internal Political Division of the ISI in the 1980s, had persuaded Mr.Sharif, then a small businessman in Dubai, to return to Pakistan and take over the leadership of the Pakistan Muslim League (PML) in order to counter Mrs.Benazir's Pakistan People's Party (PPP). Mrs.Benazir again had him sacked on her return to power in 1993 and arrested and prosecuted him on charges of indulging in illegal activities, but he was acquitted. After capturing power on October 12,1999, Gen.Pervez Musharraf, Pakistan's self-reinstated Chief of the Army Staff (COAS), self-styled Chief Executive and self-promoted President, had Brig.Imtiaz, because of his proximity to Mr.Sharif, rearrested and prosecuted for having assets disproportionate to his known sources of income as an officer of the ISI and the IB. He was convicted by a court on July 31,2001, and jailed for eight years. According to evidence produced in the court by the National Accountability Bureau (NAB), Brig.Imtiaz had foreign exchange bearer certificates worth US $ 20.08 million, a Pakistani rupee account in the Union Bank with a balance of Rs.2.13 billion, a US $ account in the Deutsch Bank with a balance of US $ 19.1 million, five residential houses, five commercial units and three shops. This huge wealth was allegedly accumulated by him through heroin smuggling. It is believed that there are at least 30 such Army and ISI officers, serving and retired, who have accumulated similar wealth through heroin smuggling. The present estimate of Pakistan's annual earnings through heroin dollars, including by this writer, is about US $ 1.5 billion. It is difficult to come across precise, direct evidence for such estimates. The estimate till now has been based on indirect evidence such as the following: * The Government of Pakistan releases its foreign exchange reserves position in two parts. The first part gives the figures of reserves maintained by the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP). These are the amounts earned through foreign trade, investment flows, foreign aid and loans and remittances by overseas Pakistanis. The second part gives the figures of reserves available with other banks. These are the deposits of resident Pakistanis, who are allowed to maintain dollar accounts with no questions asked about the origin of the money and about its liability for income tax. Under Pakistan Government orders, these amounts cannot be used by the Government for its purposes though Mr. Sharif froze them temporarily after the Chagai nuclear tests in 1998 in order to be able to use them if the economic sanctions hit the", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:010810ft.isiheroin.txt:1:e2900ffa47f9", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 6727, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "010810ft.isiheroin.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "010810ft.isiheroin", "chunk_index": 2, "text": "figures of reserves available with other banks.

Under Pakistan Government orders, these amounts cannot be used by the Government for its purposes though Mr. Sharif froze them temporarily after the Chagai nuclear tests in 1998 in order to be able to use them if the economic sanctions hit the State economy hard. * US dollars kept by private citizens in their possession without being deposited in the banks. The SBP periodically purchases these dollars to meet debt servicing and other governmental needs. In any analysis, it would be reasonable to presume that the dollars kept in the bank accounts of resident Pakistanis and the dollars in private circulation must have been largely, if not totally, derived from the heroin trade. There cannot be any other explanation for it because Pakistan has been having a trade deficit for many years in succession, there has been a 73 per cent decline in foreign direct investments and a negative flow of portfolio investments and there was no international assistance forthcoming from October,1999, till November,2000, when the IMF resumed its stand-by credit facilities to Pakistan. Quoting SBP sources, the \"Business Recorder\" of Pakistan (August 1,2001) gave the following figures, which provide a fairly accurate estimate of the US dollars available in private hands during the financial year 2000-01: * The SBP had $ 1.7 billion, which was the official foreign exchange reserve of the State. In addition, resident Pakistanis had deposits in various commercial banks amounting to US $ 1.5 billion. * During the financial years 1999-2000 and 2000-01, despite the suspension of credit facilities by the IMF and other multilateral institutions after the military coup, the Government fulfilled debt servicing (debt and interest payments) obligations amounting to US $ 7.8 billion. Out of this, US $ 4 billion came from the Govt. coffers and the balance of US $ 3.8 billion was purchased from resident Pakistanis. In other words, the total amount of US $ in private circulation since the military regime came to power was almost equal to that in the Govt. coffers, if not more. The first direct piece of evidence about the total value of the heroin money being pumped into the Pakistani economy every year has come from an unexpected source---the Taliban. Before 1998, opium was being grown in the North-West Frontier Province (NWFP) of Pakistan and in the Nangarhar province in Taliban-controlled Afghan territory. All the Pakistani-owned refineries for heroin extraction were located in Taliban-controlled territory. In 1998-2000, the Pakistani authorities stopped the cultivation of opium in the NWFP. In 2000-01, the Taliban too, under international pressure, ostensibly banned opium cultivation in its territory, but did not dismantle the Pakistani-owned heroin refineries. It demanded that international narcotics", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:010810ft.isiheroin.txt:2:83f20dd616e6", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 6728, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "010810ft.isiheroin.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "010810ft.isiheroin", "chunk_index": 3, "text": "an unexpected source---the Taliban.

In 2000-01, the Taliban too, under international pressure, ostensibly banned opium cultivation in its territory, but did not dismantle the Pakistani-owned heroin refineries. It demanded that international narcotics control agencies should reimburse to it the money lost by its farmers due to this ban so that they can shift to other crops. US and other foreign narcotics control officials, who visited Nangarhar, confirmed that opium cultivation has been stopped. However, doubts remain on the following points: * Has the Taliban secretly shifted the opium cultivation from the traditional areas in Nangarhar to which international experts had access to other remote areas to which they did not have? * Due to a bumper crop and record heroin production in previous years, the prices of heroin in the international heroin market had been coming down. Pakistani smugglers, supported by the ISI, had enough heroin stocks to meet at least two years' demand of the market. Was the Taliban merely suspending cultivation during this period to stabilise the prices? Despite these misgivings, the US announced a contribution of US 1.5 million to international narcotics control programmes for disbursement to the Afghan farmers who have stopped poppy cultivation. The Taliban has been describing this as worse than peanuts and demanding much more. This was one of the subjects which figured during the discussions of Mrs.Christina Rocca, US Assistant Secretary of State, with Mullah Abdus Salam Zaeef , the Taliban Ambassador in Islamabad, and his No. 2, Mr. Sohail Shaheen, at Islamabad on August 2. According to the \"Frontier Post\" of Peshawar (August 3,2001), while briefing pressmen after the discussions, a spokesman of the Taliban said : \"We have told the US team that Afghanistan was earning 12 billion dollars a year from the poppy cultivation and we have eliminated the poppy from the country.\" How much of this amount was going to the Taliban and how much to the Pakistanis and the ISI, who owned all the refineries? No direct evidence is available, but one can estimate roughly that out of this at least US $ 11 billion per annum was going to Pakistan from the following circumstantial evidence: * There are no reports of large amounts in US dollars circulating in private hands in Taliban-controlled Afghanistan , whereas Pakistan is awash with them. * There are no large-scale development and other activities in Afghanistan which would indicate the availability of large funds in cash. There is so much poverty due to lack of development that thousands of Afghans have been migrating to Pakistan. * Since its capture of Kabul in September,1996,", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:010810ft.isiheroin.txt:3:f3f8df8725e7", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 6729, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "010810ft.isiheroin.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "010810ft.isiheroin", "chunk_index": 4, "text": "to Pakistan from the following circumstantial evidence: * There are no reports of large amounts in US dollars circulating in private hands in Taliban-controlled Afghanistan , whereas Pakistan is awash with them. * There are no large-scale development and other activities in Afghanistan which would indicate the availability of large funds in cash. There is so much poverty due to lack of development that thousands of Afghans have been migrating to Pakistan. * Since its capture of Kabul in September,1996, the Taliban had not been publishing its budget figures. Some details are now available for the first time. According to these figures, during the financial year 2001-02, the Taliban would have an estimated expenditure of US $ 82.53 million, of which US $ 43.53 million is shown as the Discretionary Fund of Mulla Mohammad Omer, the Amir. The balance is to be spent by various departments. Quoting a study of the New York University Centre, the \"Dawn\" of Karachi (June 4,2001) estimates that the Taliban gets US $ 45 million per annum from the heroin trade, an amount nearly equal to the Amir's Discretionary Fund. If this figure of what the Taliban gets is taken as reasonable, more than US $ 11 billion per annum from the heroin trade goes to Pakistan, that is, more than Pakistani Rs. 715 billion at one US $ equal to 65 Pak rupees. During 2000-01, the Pakistani State had a total revenue of Rs.570.6 billion, of which Rs.471.6 billion came from taxes. That is, Pakistan's heroin economy was 30 per cent larger than its legitimate State economy. Is it any wonder that its economy does not collapse despite the worst predictions and that it is able to defy international pressure on its sponsorship of terrorism against India and on its support to the Taliban and Osama bin Laden? © Copyright 2001 FAIR USE NOTICE: This site contains copyrighted material the use of which has not always been specifically authorized by the copyright owner.

WASHINGTON (AP)--The FBIhas received 700 lead in the investigation of Tuesday's twin terrorist attacks but so far no arrests have been made, a Justice Department official said. Based on information gathered from frantic phone calls made by passengers on doomed jets just minutes before they crashed, the government believes that the hijackers were trained pilots and that three to five hijackers were aboard each of four airliners that crashed Tuesday in the worst terrorist attack ever on U.S. soil, said Mindy Tucker, Justice Department spokeswoman. \"It appears from what we know that the hijackers were skilled pilots,\" said Tucker. Tucker declined to comment on evidence linking the attacks to Saudi exile Osama bin Laden or whether authorities have executed search warrants. Lawmakers believe bin Laden may have been behind the attacks. \"I don't think everyone in Congress has enough information to make those assumptions,\" said Tucker. She said investigators are following all credible leads, but declined to comment on whether the government is close to arresting anyone. The Justice Department's terrorism, violent crimes, office of intelligence and violent crime divisions are involved in the investigation, she said. Attorney General John Ashcroft briefed 225 members of Congress late Tuesday and will meet with lawmakers again Wednesday with FBIDirector Robert Mueller and FEMA Director Joe Allbaugh. Ashcroft met with national security officials at the White House early Wednesday. From broken bits of hijacked airplanes to intelligence intercepts, the FBIis collecting evidence in its search for those responsible for Tuesday's twin terrorist attacks. At the Pentagon and World Trade Center, agents sifted through the rubble. \"The FBIevidence recovery team has found parts of the fuselage outside\" the Pentagon, Fairfax County chief Michael Tamillow said Wednesday. \"As we go in we're now identifying smaller parts of the plane. Everyone is looking for the black box recorders.\" Those recorders could contain conversations from the cockpits of the doomed planes. \"Everything is pointing in the direction of Osama bin Laden,\" said Sen. Orrin Hatch, the top Republican on the Senate Judiciary", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:010912ap.txt:0:a6725618e9cf", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 6733, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "010912ap.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "010912ap", "chunk_index": 1, "text": "Trade Center, agents sifted through the rubble. \"The FBIevidence recovery team has found parts of the fuselage outside\" the Pentagon, Fairfax County chief Michael Tamillow said Wednesday. \"As we go in we're now identifying smaller parts of the plane. Everyone is looking for the black box recorders.\" Those recorders could contain conversations from the cockpits of the doomed planes. \"Everything is pointing in the direction of Osama bin Laden,\" said Sen. Orrin Hatch, the top Republican on the Senate Judiciary Committee. A flight manifest from one of the ill-fated flights included the name of a suspected bin Laden supporter, Hatch and several law enforcement officials confirmed. And **U.S. intelligence intercepted communications between bin Laden supporters discussing Tuesday's attacks on the World Trade Center in New York and the Pentagon, Hatch told The Associated Press**. \"They have an intercept of some information that included people associated with bin Laden who acknowledged a couple of targets were hit,\" he said. Hatch declined to be more specific. Officials cautioned it was too early to definitively assign blame but said early evidence was pointing toward bin Laden. Ruling Taliban leaders in Afghanistan, where bin Laden is believed to be hiding, said they doubted the wealthy Arab could have been behind the attacks. Bin Laden previously has been tied to terrorist attacks against Americans overseas. Whatever the case, each detail gathered in the hours immediately after the breathtaking devastation in New York and Washington pointed toward a carefully planned plot executed by knife-wielding hijackers to ensure the maximum casualties at two of Americas most famous landmarks. Law enforcement officials told the AP that early evidence suggested the attackers may have studied how to operate large aircraft and targeted transcontinental flights with large fuel supplies to ensure spectacular explosions -and maximum destruction. Thousands were believed dead in New York and Washington. \"These heinous acts of violence are an assault on the security of our nation,\" Ashcroft declared as thousands of federal investigators fanned out across the country pursuing leads. \"We will expend every effort and devote all the necessary resources to bring the people responsible for these acts, these crimes, to justice,\" he said. Farewell phone calls from passengers and at least one flight attendant on the four targeted flights described a similar pattern: hijackers working in groups of three to five, wielding knives, in some cases stabbing flight crews as they took control of the cockpit and forced the planes toward their intended targets. The FBIwas seeking search warrants in Broward County in southern Florida and Daytona Beach in central Florida. A car was towed by authorities at one of those locations. Other leads were being pursued. Authorities examined a van seized in New York for possible clues, while a car found at the Boston airport where one of the planes was hijacked reportedly contained an Arabic language flight manual.

FBIagents \"informed me that there were two individuals that were students at Huffman Aviation, my employer, and FBItold me they were involved in yesterday's tragedy,\" said Charlie Voss, who was interviewed with his wife, Drew Voss, at their home. The couple accepted the two men as house guests as a favor to the company, Voss said. The men, who stayed just a few days, trained at the airport and came to the house to sleep, he said.

In destructive energy, the building collapses were slightly larger than the small earthquake that shook the East Side of Manhattan on Jan. 17, scientists said yesterday. ''It was pretty good sized,'' said Lynn R. Sykes, a seismologist at the Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory at Columbia University, which tracks global earthquakes from its base 10 miles north of Manhattan. Scientists at Lamont were watching news of the crashes on television when their seismographs began to jump. ''I just cried,'' said Won-Young Kim, the scientist in charge of monitoring quakes in the Northeast, knowing that the sensors were registering more than just the force of falling concrete. The seismographs also recorded the impacts of the airplanes, the first at 8:46 a.m. and the second at 9:03 a.m., Dr. Sykes said. The tower collapses, he added, came at 9:59 and 10:28 a.m. The destructive energy of the January earthquake was magnitude 2.4, a minor earthquake. It was felt in Manhattan and Queens. Dr. Sykes said the twin tower collapses were slightly larger in destructive energy. (The collapse hours later of a much shorter building, 7 World Trade Center, did not register in initial seismograph readings, scientists said.)

REMPEL;RICHARD A. SERRANO; *(Copyright, The Times Mirror Company; Los Angeles Times 2001 All rights reserved)* Authorities searching nationwide for terrorists behind the deadly airliner attacks on the Pentagon and the World Trade Center have identified teams that totaled as many as 50 infiltrators who supported or carried out the strikes, a source familiar with the investigation said Wednesday. About 40 of the men have been accounted for, including those killed in the suicide attacks, but 10 remain at large, the source said. In the hours immediately after the assaults, he said, agents searching cars and apartments up and down the East Coast found suicide notes in New York that some of the hijackers wrote to their parents. Also recovered were credit card receipts showing that some of the hijackers paid for flight training in the United States. Another source, a federal agent involved in the probe, said that authorities believe 27 suspected terrorists in all received various kinds of pilot training. The infiltrators, who carried Middle Eastern passports, belonged to four independent cells, said law enforcement and intelligence officials. They said authorities kept the nation's airports closed to commercial traffic for a second day partly to prevent the conspirators from fleeing the country. The investigation reached from Maine to Florida and across the nation to California. Atty. Gen. John Ashcroft said the FBI had mobilized 4,000 agents and 3,000 support personnel. He called it \"perhaps the most massive and intensive investigation ever conducted in America.\" In coordinated attacks Tuesday morning, hijackers rammed two airliners filled with passengers into the twin towers of the World Trade Center in New York and a third jetliner into the Pentagon. The fourth hijacked aircraft crashed in western Pennsylvania. Authorities said it might have been aimed at a target in Washington, D.C., or Camp David, the presidential retreat in Maryland.

The fourth hijacked aircraft crashed in western Pennsylvania. Authorities said it might have been aimed at a target in Washington, D.C., or Camp David, the presidential retreat in Maryland. The administration said the president himself might have been targeted. Bush spokesman Ari Fleischer said the government had credible information that the hijacked plane which struck the Pentagon \"was originally intended to hit the White House.\" Another possible target, Fleischer said, was Air Force One. Authorities said Wednesday they have identified many of the hijackers, who wielded knives and box cutters and made bomb threats once on board. They carried passports from two nations, Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison (R-Texas) said after a briefing by law enforcement officials. She declined to name the countries but said both are in the Middle East. Federal agents detained several people for immigration violations, FBI Director Robert Mueller said, but there have been no arrests. A law enforcement source said one detainee was being held as a material witness. FBI agents searched at least three flight schools in Florida and asked for information about former students who were suspected of being among the hijackers. Agents also searched unidentified flight schools in Southern California. The Florida schools included Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University in Daytona Beach, Huffman Aviation International in Venice and FlightSafety International in Vero Beach. Authorities said two of the suspected hijackers entered the United States on work visas. They began learning to fly last summer at Huffman, according to their flight instructor, their landlord and law enforcement officials. In addition, federal agents were retracing the steps of suspected hijackers who attended flight schools in Vero Beach, Pompano Beach and Daytona Beach. Ashcroft said there were three to six hijackers on each of the four planes that crashed Tuesday. Authorities have quickly focused on those who may have learned to fly jumbo jets well enough to guide the planes into the World Trade Center and the Pentagon. Ashcroft said authorities have uncovered \"numerous credible leads\" by questioning people and serving search warrants from Maine to the southern end of Florida. FBI agents apparently were drawn to Huffman after finding its name and an Arabic-language flight manual in a car left at Logan International Airport in Boston, from which two of the planes took off Tuesday morning before being hijacked. Rudi Dekkers said that two students, one identified as Amanullah Atta Mohammed and the other only as \"Marwan,\" paid $10,000 each by check to attend his Huffman Aviation International flight school at the airport in Venice from July to November 2000. \"They came in through the front door,\" Dekkers said, adding that", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:010913latimes.txt:1:4e319631bdde", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 6740, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "010913latimes.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "010913latimes", "chunk_index": 2, "text": "and an Arabic-language flight manual in a car left at Logan International Airport in Boston, from which two of the planes took off Tuesday morning before being hijacked.

They lived nearby and bicycled here every day.\" Dekkers said that one of the men said he wanted to learn to fly jumbo jets. The Huffman school is about 25 years old and handles about 800 students a year. It is a small building on the edge of the Venice airport, and 75% to 80% of his students are foreigners who come to the United States to learn flying because it costs less. Dekkers said that his school trains fliers for single- or small- engine aircraft and that the two men needed such a certificate to qualify for training to fly jets. He said he was told that the two men went on to a jet school in Pompano Beach, Fla. Dekkers described one of the students as \"a big, chubby guy and a likable person.\" Now, realizing that two of the hijackers may have passed through his school, Dekkers said, \"I feel terrible. I feel worse than anyone.\" Charles Voss, the school bookkeeper, and his wife, Dru, took the two men in as boarders in their south Venice home for a couple weeks in July. Dru Voss said the men appeared to be in their 30s and were very secretive, claiming to be from Germany. She said that she and her husband eventually evicted them because they were unkempt and did not keep their bedroom clean. \"I didn't really care for their attitude,\" she said. \"Their personality was nothing to care for. They kept to themselves.\" She said they often would step out of the shower and shake their hair dry throughout the house. Alluding to Tuesday's tragedy, she added: \"Do I feel bad? Do I ever.\" Det. Sgt. Mike Treanor of the Venice Police Department said that FBI agents had obtained the two suspects' school records from the Huffman school and the Voss home and identified them as two of the men who agents believe flew the hijacked jets. \"This one man, Atta,\" said Treanor, \"was confirmed on one of the planes that hit the towers.\" It remained unclear how or when the men arrived in this country, but", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:010913latimes.txt:2:2f0bc87e351f", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 6741, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "010913latimes.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "010913latimes", "chunk_index": 3, "text": "\"Do I feel bad?

Officer Chuck Lesaltato of the Sarasota County Sheriff's Office said that the car in Boston also had registration papers that listed a Venice, Fla., address. Local and federal authorities said that, while the flight schools in Florida often are filled with foreign students, there is no requirement for background checks. One senior FBI official in Washington complained that \"there are lots of flight schools out there. You don't have to be accredited to fly, and they don't do any background checks on people who want to learn how to fly.\" Federal agents conducted additional searches across Florida. Search warrants were served on four homes in Davie and an apartment in Coral Springs, and workers at a restaurant in Hollywood were also interviewed. In Vero Beach, dozens of FBI agents questioned neighbors about several Middle Eastern men who were reportedly taking classes at the nearby flight school. Eight agents showed up at Hank Habora's house Wednesday morning and questioned him about his next-door neighbor. \"They gave me a photo and asked if this was the guy, and I said yes.\" Habora said he knew the man as \"John.\" FAA records show that a Saudi Arabian flight engineer named Amer Mohammed Kamfar listed the address as his home. The man lived in the house with his wife and four children from February until two or three weeks ago, when he \"left in a hurry\" in a green van, Habora said. \"They took all of the stuff they had and put it out by the trash: clothes, furniture, pots and pans, Tupperware,\" he said. He said the man often wore the uniform of student pilots at nearby FlightSafety, a school that frequently trains foreign pilots on jumbo jets. Habora, 55, said he wasn't surprised when the FBI agents knocked at his door Wednesday because he had phoned the bureau earlier to report his suspicions. \"They were good neighbors as far as neighbors go,\" he said. \"They were quiet. They kept the lawn mowed. They put the garbage out when it was needed", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:010913latimes.txt:3:b377b7077dbe", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 6742, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "010913latimes.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "010913latimes", "chunk_index": 4, "text": "he said.

They kept the lawn mowed. They put the garbage out when it was needed to be put out.\" About eight miles away, FBI agents questioned Kenneth Reams about two Middle Eastern families who lived on his Vero Beach street. More than a dozen police cars lined the street all day. \"My wife thought they were gone,\" said Reams, 72. \"She hasn't seen the children in weeks.\" Reams said the men who lived in the two houses also were taking classes at FlightSafety. The men had been renting the houses for more than a year, Reams said, living there with their wives and children. \"They seemed to be nice.\" The owner of one of the houses, Llonald Mixell, said the tenant moved out with his wife and at least three children a week before the hijackings. Mixell said the tenant, whose name he refused to divulge, was a commercial pilot from Saudi Arabia who was getting advanced training at FlightSafety. FBI agents also questioned Mixell on Wednesday. \"Hundreds of people come over here from other countries for schooling,\" Mixell said. \"They were excellent tenants. I never saw anything that would make me suspect anything.\" The tenant who leased the house from Mixell was a man named Abdulrahman Alomari, a pilot from Saudi Arabia. The house next door was leased by Adnan Zakana Bukhari, another Saudi pilot, records show. The former head of the FBI's New York office, who led investigations into the 1998 bombings of U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania, said that within hours of Tuesday's attacks federal agents had talked to the families of nearly every passenger listed on the four airliners' manifests, isolated those who could not be vouched for by their friends and relatives, and pulled their bank, credit card and phone records, as well as their immigration and naturalization papers if they were from another country. Lewis Schiliro, the former assistant FBI director in charge of the New York field office from 1998 to April 2000, said hundreds of agents in cities nationwide used that information to develop background \"on those who stood out: who they were, where they stayed, who they called, who sponsored them, what phone calls they made.\" Schiliro said agents have pulled INS files, looked for links between the passengers listed on the hijacked planes and examined footage from dozens of cameras at the three airports where the terrorists boarded the aircraft.

Federal law enforcement sources said scores of subpoenas were issued and searches were approved and conducted by late Wednesday, under the secrecy of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, which permits secret electronic surveillance in the United States based on probable cause that the target of the surveillance is the agent of a foreign power. \"The fight against those who use the weapon of terror to menace and murder is necessarily hard,\" CIA Director George J. Tenet told employees at the CIA headquarters in Langley, Va. \"The important thing for us now is to do our job,\" Tenet said, \"to run to ground a vicious foe, one without heart or pity. A foe who has killed Americans but who hopes in vain to kill the ideals and values that define all of us as Americans. \"The terrorists behind these atrocities, and those who give them shelter and support, must never know rest, ease or comfort. The last word must not be theirs.\" In Boston, federal agents, bomb specialists, firefighters and police officers staged a dramatic midday raid on the Westin Copley Place hotel. Wearing black hoods and heavy bulletproof vests, agents carried battering rams, AR-15 firearms and fiber-optic equipment, which can check under doors. They took into custody three people, who were later released. In Newton, Mass., just west of Boston, officers converged on the Park Inn at Chestnut Hill. They seized a car containing flight manuals and an instruction book on how to fly a Boeing 767. In Maine, an aide to Gov. Angus King said a silver Nissan with Massachusetts license plates was impounded at the Portland airport. The vehicle was taken to a state crime lab in Augusta for examination by the FBI. A cigarette found near the car will be tested for DNA, the aide said. King's office said two of the suspects in the World Trade Center attack are believed to have entered Maine by ferry from Nova Scotia. Using New Jersey driver's licenses for identification, the men apparently flew to Boston early Tuesday from the Portland International Jetport, the governor's office said. Investigators in Portland believe the suspects may have boarded a USAir flight to Boston early Tuesday. On Wednesday, authorities in Providence, R.I., stopped an Amtrak train from Boston. Passengers were ordered off, and one man wearing a green turban was led away in handcuffs. Providence police said the man was charged with a local weapon violation for carrying a knife.

Can he be stopped at last? By Michael Hirsh NEWSWEEK Sept. 13 issue - At the time it seemed an empty boast, if a chilling one. On Feb. 7, 1995, Ramzi Yousef, considered the mastermind of the 1993 World Trade Center bombing, was being escorted in shackles back to New York City. The FBI had just seized Yousef in Pakistan, and agents felt they could crow a little. An FBI SWAT commando pulled up his captive's blindfold and nudged him as they flew in a helicopter over mid-Manhattan, pointing to the World Trade Center's lights glowing in the clear night. \"Look down there,\" he told Yousef. \"They're still standing.\" Yousef replied, \"They wouldn't be if I had enough money and explosives.\" RECALLS LEWIS SCHILIRO, a former head of the FBI's New York field office, \"He was as cold as ice.\" Today Ramzi Yousef is safely in prison, as are five of his confederates from the failed 1993 attempt. But Yousef's passion for killing Americans is flourishing in a loose network of tiny Islamic fundamentalist terror groups spread around the world. And the main suspect in the worst foreign attack on the continental United States is the chief impresario and financier of that network, Osama bin Laden, the gaunt, bearded Saudi exile who in February 1998 declared all Americans to be legitimate targets of jihad, or holy war. Bin Laden has nursed a fervent hatred of the United States since its troops landed on Saudi soil to fight the gulf war, and he has haunted the worst nightmares of U.S. security officials for years. The scion of a wealthy Saudi magnate, he was linked to the 1998 twin U.S. Embassy bombings in Africa and the explosion aboard the USS Cole in Yemen last year. But until last Tuesday, bin Laden had not succeeded in shedding blood on American soil. By the end of America's day of horror, U.S. intelligence officials said, most people inside the federal government were almost certain-about 90 percent certain, the consensus had it-that bin Laden and his global organization, Al Qaeda (The Base), were behind the attacks. One key reason: shortly after the suicide attacks, a source with access to intelligence told NEWSWEEK, U.S. intelligence picked up communications among bin Laden associates relaying a message: \"We've hit the targets.\" On Wednesday,", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:010913newsweek.txt:0:96a5d40aa1fc", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 6747, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "010913newsweek.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "010913newsweek", "chunk_index": 1, "text": "blood on American soil.

One key reason: shortly after the suicide attacks, a source with access to intelligence told NEWSWEEK, U.S. intelligence picked up communications among bin Laden associates relaying a message: \"We've hit the targets.\" On Wednesday, the FBI detained several people whom they are now describing as \"material witnesses\" in Boston and south Florida. Authorities also said they had identified the two or three terrorists who hijacked each plane. The suspects were said to have entered the country from all over the world, and some had been living in the United States for up to a year. Early leads suggest the team had domestic support networks rooted in the Boston area, but some of the bombers may have come from Canada, which also harbored the terrorist cell that planned the millennium bombing in Los Angeles. A British intelligence source told NEWSWEEK that \"two brothers, working on United Arab Emirates passports, one of them a trained pilot, have been placed at the Boston airport.\" Even so, investigators had only just begun to ferret out the full dimensions of the plot. \"We're in Oklahoma mode now,\" said one FBI counterterrorism agent, referring to the frenzy of police work that followed the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing. He added: \"This is a rubble pile that makes Oklahoma City look like a sandbox.\" New FBI chief Robert Mueller, on only his second week of work, conducted a 6 p.m. conference call with special agents in charge of all the 56 field offices. He announced that Washington would take control of the biggest investigation in the agency's history and appointed veteran deputy director Tom Pickard to run it. FBI officials said they knew this probe was different from anything else they'd ever done. \"This is not going to be a classic forensic investigation,\" said the counterterrorism agent. \"You're not looking for a traditional bomb 'signature' like the rear axle of the Ryder truck. The bomb signature is a plane in the sky.\" In other words, there may be little forensic evidence to investigate. **SEARCHING FOR LINKS ** For the moment the link to bin Laden and Ramzi Yousef appeared to be largely circumstantial. Investigators believe that radical Egyptian organizations were directly behind the suicide attacks. One, Al Gamaa al Islamiya, was run by Sheik Omar Abdel-Rahman, the blind Muslim cleric who is serving a prison term in Minnesota for allegedly conspiring with World Trade Center bombing suspects to blow up other New York landmarks. Bin Laden recently has turned complaints about Abdel-Rahman's imprisonment and treatment by U.S. authorities into a crusade, committing his followers to freeing the religious leader. U.S. officials have", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:010913newsweek.txt:1:9e8d82ba915e", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 6748, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "010913newsweek.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "010913newsweek", "chunk_index": 2, "text": "circumstantial.

Bin Laden recently has turned complaints about Abdel-Rahman's imprisonment and treatment by U.S. authorities into a crusade, committing his followers to freeing the religious leader. U.S. officials have identified Ayman al-Zawahiri, the head of another Egyptian militant group that supports the sheik, as deputy leader of Al Qaeda. Abdel-Rahman is kept in solitary confinement, and a month ago U.S. authorities seized his radio. Bush called last Tuesday's searing experience a demonstration of American fortitude. In truth it was a stunning display of America's vulnerability-now and well into the future. The fast fingering of bin Laden also did not mask the fact that, like the rest of the country, U.S. officials were in a state of shock over what may go down as the most massive failure of military and intelligence readiness in the nation's history. Bush called last Tuesday's searing experience a demonstration of American fortitude. In truth it was a stunning display of America's vulnerability-now and well into the future. Always before, U.S. experts tended to dismiss the idea that terrorists could combine both suicidal fervor and technical skill and sophistication. The 1993 World Trade Center attack, in which conspirators exploded a bomb-laden van in the basement, was seen as just another ragged effort; afterward the terrorists gave themselves away when one was stupid enough to try to get his deposit back on the rental van. Similarly, when an Algerian terrorist was arrested crossing the border from Canada just before Y2K, his obvious nervousness gave him away to an alert Customs official. By contrast, last Tuesday's coordinated assault on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon was as sophisticated a terror attack as U.S. investigators have seen. A chief mystery was how the culprits might have found four apparently trained pilots to fly suicide missions. One frightening prospect is that bin Laden is winning educated Arab elites to his cause, especially as the Palestinian intifada inflames the Arab world. The FBI has picked up previous hints of high-level help: in 1995 Abdul Hakim Murad, a Pakistani, was accused along with Yousef of a plot to bomb 11 U.S. airliners in a single \"day of rage\" against the United States.

Could the bombers have been stopped? **NEWSWEEK has learned that while U.S. intelligence received no specific warning, the state of alert had been high during the past two weeks, and a particularly urgent warning may have been received the night before the attacks, causing some top Pentagon brass to cancel a trip. Why that same information was not available to the 266 people who died aboard the four hijacked commercial aircraft may become a hot topic on the Hill.** In testimony to the Intelligence Committee earlier this year, CIA Director George Tenet said bin Laden posed the most immediate terrorist threat to Americans around the world and was capable of \"multiple attacks with little or no warning.\" \"There is a giant accountability issue starting today,\" says former Afghanistan CIA station chief Milt Bearden, \"and in the midst of legitimate accountability there will be a lot of scapegoating. They're going to start looking for the modern-day equivalent of General Short and Admiral Kimmel [the armed-forces commanders at Pearl Harbor], and they're going to find them.\" The deeper problem for counterterrorism experts is that bin Laden's network is so diffuse and diverse-a patchwork of renegade Algerian, Palestinian, Egyptian and other cells-and that foreign governments, including friendly ones, move slowly to crack down on people they know are his supporters. Only last February, a few weeks before Tenet's testimony, a NEWSWEEK reporter sat down in a London coffee shop with Yasser el-Sirri, one of bin Laden's alleged associates. El-Sirri cheerfully boasted that the Egyptian government had sentenced him to death for crimes of terrorism. Attempts to snatch or kill bin Laden have been frustrated by the difficulty of getting precise information on where he is in the mountains of Afghanistan, not to mention a U.S. presidential order barring assassination. Though U.S. intelligence had wiretaps on bin Laden's key lieutenants before the Kenya and Tanzania embassy bombings, they were unable to pick up enough information to prevent them. **TESTING U.S. INTELLIGENCE ** Some counterterrorism operatives now speculate that intelligence picked up by U.S. agencies about possible terrorist attacks on Americans last June may actually have been leaked by operatives associated with bin Laden. Now it appears the terrorists \"may have been testing where and how we picked up information-and what were the things we missed,\" says a U.S. investigator based in the Persian Gulf. \"They saw where we reacted, and presumably also where we didn't react.\" Were they casing American airports to see if extra precautions went into", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:010913newsweek.txt:3:36bd3aef36b2", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 6750, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "010913newsweek.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "010913newsweek", "chunk_index": 4, "text": "intelligence picked up by U.S. agencies about possible terrorist attacks on Americans last June may actually have been leaked by operatives associated with bin Laden.

The ability of unknown bombers to exploit these soft spots-and to do it so jarringly, ripping a hole in the heart of America's financial and military power-could itself have serious consequences. For it demonstrates that it can be done again. In fact, terrorism experts say that for years their worst fear has been that a suicide bomber would hit inside U.S. borders. \"If someone really wants to kill himself in order to blow up a building here, there is no level of sustainable security in this country that could prevent it,\" says one official. \"We just aren't equipped to handle it. It is beyond us psychologically. And the citizens of this country are not willing to tolerate the lack of freedom that this level of security would mean.\" That could now change, as part of a tectonic shift in America's sense of vulnerability. \"This shows that you can have mass-destruction terrorism without weapons of mass destruction,\" says Gideon Rose, a terror expert at the Council on Foreign Relations. And that even a missile defense won't help. \"We're going to have to enact laws that some people from the far left and the far right won't like,\" adds a senior intelligence source. He points to Britain's sweeping new law that, as he puts it, extends the draconian security measures-including surveillance and holding people on mere suspicion-already used in troubled Northern Ireland. He adds: \"We have to understand that national security will have to take some precedence over what we have seen as the right to privacy.\" Sen. Jon Kyl, a member of the Intelligence Committee, says he's been pushing for years for more intelligence money and less red tape-and for dropping concerns about recruiting human-rights violators as infiltrators into terror groups. \"My first reaction was that my knees were weak,\" he said. \"But frankly, my second reaction was that all of the things we've been saying we have to do-maybe through this disaster they'll get more attention.\" No doubt they will.

Trafficker of weapons and narcotics, the first \"total terrorist\" manages a multinational of a kind new Oussama Bin Laden has copied a legend from that of the \"Old man of the mountain\", Master of the fortress of Alamut, in Persia, in the 13th century, and terror of the Crusaders. This spiritual head sent his Hashishim (becoming our \"assassins\"), to kill all his enemies, often at the price of their life. Osama bin Laden wants to be ascetic, a combatant in the name of the faith, wasting his personal fortune in the name of the jihad, the holy war. There is also a reality, much less noble: that of a businessman handler, administrating a terrorist multinational, trafficker of weapons and morphine, created by the powers which it intends to fight. A young person still (43 years), certainly believing, but also a specialist in screen companies, virtuoso of financial jugglings, the first \"total terrorist\". He is dreaded by the American services information services, but, affirms an observer of the Arab scene, he himself was a insider, controlled a long time by the CIA. Osama bin Laden knows of the interior, the networks, the strings, the folding screens, and has practice as a master of finance. The wife of a rich person of a Saudi tribe, graduate of the University of Jeddah, the young civil engineer was recruited by the CIA in Istanbul, in 1979. The Afghanistan war had just begun and Istanbul was the place of transit chosen by the Americans to forward volunteers to the Afghan guerrillas. Initially responsible for logistics, Osama bin Laden became the financial intermediary of the weapons traffic, financed equally by the United States and Saudi Arabia, to a total value of approximately 1.2 billion dollar per year. In 1980, he began in Afghanistan where he remained until the departure of the Russian troops, in 1989. He was charged to distribute resources between the various factions of resistance, a key role, eminently political. At the time, he profited from the total support of the Americans and the Saudis, via his friend, Prince Turki Bin Fayçal, brother of the king and head of the Saudi secret service, as well as its family. He transformed \"clean\" money into \"salted\" money and also the reverse. According to Richard Labévière, Radio International France (author of the book Dollars of terror, Grasset), the terrorist apprentice set up a den of opium with his friend Gulbuddin Hekmatyar, who reigns in the province of Helmand.

According to Richard Labévière, Radio International France (author of the book Dollars of terror, Grasset), the terrorist apprentice set up a den of opium with his friend Gulbuddin Hekmatyar, who reigns in the province of Helmand. The traffic continued in Khartoum, in Sudan, where it moved in 1992. With a good part of those named the \"Afghans\", \"a secret, strong army of 10,000 men was involved in its camps\", according to the director of the CIA Of Khartoum, it ensured the provisioning of Hekmatyar of men and weapons. Helped by its Sudanese lieutenants, it created, around \"Osama Holding\", a true group with diversified interests: finance, cars, machine tools, chemistry, public works. Thanks to the Bank of the North (Bank Ach-Chamal), it controlled a nebula of companies and nongovernmental organizations which fed the Islamist Sunnite revolution everywhere where it went: Algeria, Egypt, Syria, Asia, etc... At this time, his fortune was estimated at 2 billion dollars. His reputation as \"banker of the jihad\" was made. He lived up to the reputation, it seems. In 1994, Saudi Arabia withdrew its nationality from him, without stopping financing of the extreme Islamist networks. It was, for the royal family, an absolute need: guardian of the holy places, it draws its legitimacy only from religion. Osama bin Laden kept contact with Prince Turki. He survives everything, even after 1996, when Sudan, subjected to sanctions of UNO, requested him to leave the country. Even after 1998, when, he become the public enemy number one of the United States, a price put on his head and his bases bombarded. His family disavowed him, at least officially. As for the CIA, this connection is a mystery. The experts on this point diverge. PROFITABLE TRAFFIC From Afghanistan, Osama bin Laden continued his profitable traffic and continuous involvement with its combatants. He became the adviser and the friend of the spiritual head of the Taliban, Mohammad Omar. He put his competence in finances at their service, managed their commercial interests by the intermediary of a bank in Khartoum held by his son, and reorganized the opium roads. Installed in a luxurious villa in Kandahar, bin Laden continued to reinforce his terrorist multinational. His organization, Al-Qaida, managed twelve camps and had branches in fifty countries. Osama himself travelled to London, in a private jet, where he met with journalists. In the City, his men invested under cover in electronics, building, and import-export. One year later however, the thread had been tightened and the financial transactions of international terrorism took a turn. In Afghanistan even, bin Laden and his mujahadeen were more discrete.

One year later however, the thread had been tightened and the financial transactions of international terrorism took a turn. In Afghanistan even, bin Laden and his mujahadeen were more discrete. Elsewhere, they operated via a cascade of company screens in Pakistan, in the Gulf States, and of course in places offshore. Goatskin bottles the interests of its investments and the profit of its traffic, this nebula always profits from the financings of the Middle East, via the Islamic ONG. Or rather, profited. Three weeks ago indeed, a significant Saudi event: Prince Turki, head of the secret service and principal contact of bin Laden, was replaced by another prince, Naouaf, faithful to the Crown Prince Abdullah. The reasons for this change are not known, but the bond of the reigning family with Osama bin Laden seems to have been broken at this time. The pseudo renegade became a real renegade. And all the more dangerous. Islamist financial investments In London like elsewhere, the monitoring of the central bank on the moneylaundering operations or the counter-espionage investigations have constrained the activists to be diverted famous, Arab or different establishments, to resort to agencies of transfer of funds, like Western Union or the dispencers of exchange held by nationals of the Middle East. Out of the financial die, two other networks are used by the Islamic extremists to bear fruit on their assets, according to the NCIS, the British organization in charge of the fight against the dirty money. They are the law firms and the accounts offices. The large Anglo-Saxon legal companies indeed offer Islamic investments (in conformity with the precepts of Koran) to large fortunes of the Arab world. According to investigators of the NCIS, they would be looking less at the banks for the origin of the funds. L'homme le plus redouté des Etats-Unis, longtemps entraîné par la CIA... Recruté par l'agence américaine à l'époque de la guerre d'Afghanistan, Osama bin Laden connaît de l'intérieur tous les réseaux. Trafiquant d'armes et de stupéfiants richissime, le premier \"terroriste global\" gère une multinationale d'un genre nouveau Osama bin Laden a une légende copiée sur celle du \"Vieux de la montagne\", maître de la forteresse d'Alamut, en Perse, au XIe siècle, et terreur des Croisés.

Jeune encore (43 ans), certes croyant, mais d'abord spécialiste des sociétés écrans, virtuose des jongleries financières, le premier \"terroriste global\". S'il est tellement redouté par les services du renseignement américains, c'est, affirme un observateur de la scène arabe, qu'il est lui-même un insider, longtemps entraîné par la CIA. Osama bin Laden connaît, de l'intérieur, les réseaux, les ficelles, les paravents, et pratique en maître les paradis financiers. Fils d'une riche tribu saoudienne (lire ci-dessous), diplômé de l'université de Jeddah, le jeune ingénieur en génie civil est recruté par la CIA à Istanbul, en 1979. La guerre d'Afghanistan vient d'éclater et Istanbul est le lieu de transit choisi par les Américains pour acheminer les volontaires vers les maquis afghans. D'abord responsable de la logistique, Osama bin Laden devient l'intermédiaire financier du trafic d'armes, financé à parts égales par les Etats-Unis et l'Arabie saoudite, à hauteur de 1,2 milliard de dollars par an environ. En 1980, il gagne l'Afghanistan où il restera pratiquement jusqu'au départ des troupes russes, en 1989. Il est chargé de répartir la manne entre les différentes factions de la résistance, un rôle clé, éminemment politique. A l'époque, il bénéficie de l'appui total des Américains et du régime saoudien, via son ami, le prince Turki Bin Fayçal, frère du roi et chef des services secrets saoudiens, ainsi que de sa famille. Il transforme de l'argent \"propre\" en argent \"sale\" puis fera aussi l'inverse. Selon Richard Labévière, de Radio France Internationale (auteur du livre Les Dollars de la terreur, Grasset), l'apprenti terroriste a mis sur pied une filière d'opium avec son ami Gulbuddin Hekmatyar, qui règne sur la province de Helmand, le grenier à pavot du pays. Il poursuit ce trafic à Khartoum, au Soudan, où il s'est replié en 1992. avec une bonne partie de ceux qu'on nommera les \"Afghans\", \"une armée secrète, forte de 10 000 hommes entraînés dans ses camps\", selon le directeur de la CIA. De Khartoum, il assure l'approvisionnement d'Hekmatyar en hommes et en armes. Aidé de son lieutenant soudanais, il crée, autour de la \"Oussama Holding\", un véritable groupe aux intérêts diversifiés : finance, voitures, machines-outils, chimie, travaux publics. Grâce à la Banque du Nord (Bank Ach-Chamal), il pilote une nébuleuse de sociétés et d'organisations non gouvernementales qui alimentent la révolution islamiste sunnite partout où elle se développe : Algérie, Egypte, Syrie, Asie, etc. Dès", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:010914lemonde.txt:3:f1c0678f4764", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 6757, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "010914lemonde.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "010914lemonde", "chunk_index": 4, "text": "ses camps\", selon le directeur de la CIA.

Grâce à la Banque du Nord (Bank Ach-Chamal), il pilote une nébuleuse de sociétés et d'organisations non gouvernementales qui alimentent la révolution islamiste sunnite partout où elle se développe : Algérie, Egypte, Syrie, Asie, etc. Dès cette époque, on estime sa fortune à 2 milliards de dollars. Sa réputation de \"banquier de la djihad\" est faite. Elle le rend trop voyant. En 1994, l'Arabie saoudite lui retire sa nationalité, sans cesser pour autant de financer en sous-main les réseaux islamistes extrêmes. C'est, pour la famille royale, une absolue nécessité : gardienne des lieux saints, elle ne tire sa légitimité que de la religion. Osama bin Laden garde le contact avec le prince Turki, patron des services saoudiens. Il le conservera envers et contre tout, même après 1996, lorsque le Soudan, soumis à des sanctions de l'ONU, le prie de quitter le pays. Même après 1998, lorsque, devenu l'ennemi public numéro un des Etats-Unis, sa tête est mise à prix et ses bases bombardées. Sa famille le renie, du moins officiellement (lire ci-dessous). Quant à la CIA, mystère. Les experts sur ce point divergent. FRUCTUEUX TRAFICS Le fait est que, depuis l'Afghanistan, où il est revenu s'installer en 1998, Osama bin Laden poursuit ses fructueux trafics et continue d'entraîner ses combattants. Devenu le conseiller et l'ami du chef spirituel des talibans, Mohammad Omar, il met ses compétences en ingénierie financière à leur service, gère leurs intérêts commerciaux par l'intermédiaire d'une banque de Khartoum tenue par son fils, et réorganise les routes de l'opium. Installé dans une luxueuse villa à Kandahar, Ben Laden continue à renforcer sa multinationale du terrorisme. Son organisation, Al-Qaida, gère douze camps d'entraînements et a des succursales dans cinquante pays. Oussama lui-même voyage à Londres, dans son jet privé, où il rencontre à l'occasion des journalistes. Dans la City, ses hommes de paille ont investi sous couverture dans l'électronique, le bâtiment, l'import-export. Depuis un an toutefois, le filet s'est resserré et les transactions financières du terrorisme international ont pris un tour plus acrobatique.. En Afghanistan même, Ben Laden et ses moudjahidines se montrent plus discrets. Ailleurs, il opère via une cascade de sociétés écrans installées au Pakistan, dans les Etats du Golfe, et bien sûr dans les places offshore. Outres les intérêts de ses placements et le profit de ses trafics, la nébuleuse bénéficie toujours des financements du Moyen-Orient, via les ONG islamiques. Ou plutôt bénéficiait. Il y a trois semaines en effet, un événement important a modifié la donne saoudienne : le prince Turki, chef des services spéciaux et principal contact de Ben Laden, a été remplacé par un autre prince, Naouaf, fidèle", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:010914lemonde.txt:4:01eac5d1e4c1", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 6758, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "010914lemonde.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "010914lemonde", "chunk_index": 5, "text": "installées au Pakistan, dans les Etats du Golfe, et bien sûr dans les places offshore.

Les raisons de cette mise à l'écart ne sont pas connues, mais le lien de la famille régnante avec Osama bin Laden semble cette fois rompu. Le pseudo renégat est devenu paria. Et d'autant plus dangereux. Véronique Maurus et Marc Roche (à Londres) Des placements financiers \"islamistes\" A Londres comme ailleurs, la surveillance renforcée de la banque centrale sur les opérations de blanchiment ou les enquêtes du contre-espionnage ont contraint les activistes à se détourner des établissements renommés, arabes ou autres, pour recourir à des agences de transfert de fonds, comme la Western Union ou les officines de change tenues par des ressortissants du Proche-Orient. Hors de la filière financière, deux autres réseaux sont utilisés par les extrémistes islamistes pour faire fructifier leurs avoirs, selon le NCIS, l'organisme britannique chargé de la lutte contre l'argent sale. Ce sont les cabinets d'avocats et les bureaux comptables. Les grandes sociétés juridiques anglo-saxonnes offrent en effet des placements financiers dits \"islamistes \"(conformes aux préceptes du Coran) aux grosses fortunes du monde arabe. Selon les enquêteurs du NCIS, elles seraient moins regardantes que les banques quant à l'origine des fonds. © Copyright 2001 FAIR USE NOTICE: This site contains copyrighted material the use of which has not always been specifically authorized by the copyright owner.

Tuesday, when terrorists hijacked four commercial jetliners and crashed them in suicide attacks, did the Air Force send up planes to follow the errant aircraft? The Air Force won't say specifically. Later that day, large numbers of fighters were dispatched to guard major U.S. cities, the Air Force said. It isn't known whether air-traffic controllers asked for military assistance once the planes diverted from their flight plans and started their approaches toward their targets, the World Trade Center towers and the Pentagon. The content of any radio transmissions or controller tapes related to the terrorist attack hasn't been revealed and the FBI is conducting a massive criminal investigation. An FAA spokesman said the agency had no comment on Tuesday's events. High-altitude sentries aren't unusual. The Air Force says it keeps about 20 F-15 and F-16 fighters on duty with Air National Guards along the nation's coastline, ready to inspect unknown aircraft entering U.S. airspace. It also responds to requests from other agencies, including the Coast Guard, and FAA, which runs the nation's air-traffic control system. **\"We can scramble and be airborne in a matter of minutes,\" said an Air Force spokesperson. ** Some airline pilots, deeply shaken by the kamikaze crashes and subsequent carnage, are wondering whether the FAA did enough to try to prevent the crashes. The American Airlines plane hijacked out of Boston \"got two-thirds across Massachusetts and suddenly made a beeline for New York,\" said one pilot. \"Why didn't air-traffic control respond [and call the Air Force]?\" That plane was first to strike the World Trade Center. After a United Airlines plane also hit the building 20 minutes later, \"there should have been no", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:010914wsj.txt:0:fb6f7b110127", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 6761, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "010914wsj.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "010914wsj", "chunk_index": 1, "text": "by the kamikaze crashes and subsequent carnage, are wondering whether the FAA did enough to try to prevent the crashes.

After a United Airlines plane also hit the building 20 minutes later, \"there should have been no doubt\" that the third hijacked plane, an American jet that did a U-turn and headed toward Washington, had ill intent, said another pilot. Between the first strike in New York and the crash into the Pentagon, about an hour later, \"that was a lot of time not to do any response,\" he said. The fourth plane, a United jet bound for San Francisco from Newark, N.J., was in the air longer and made it all the way to Ohio before abruptly turning around. The plane crashed south of Pittsburgh after some passengers may have tried to subdue the hijackers. It isn't known whether the crash was caused by a struggle in the cockpit, was intentional or if the plane was indeed shot down by military aircraft that may have been sent to the scene. The FBI late yesterday said there is no evidence of a military role in the crash, revising its comments from earlier in the day that it couldn't rule out the possibility. Without question, the decision to shoot down a hijacked commercial airliner bearing innocent passengers would be very difficult to make. A former Transportation Department air-traffic-control expert said there is a defined series of steps controllers take when a plane doesn't respond to radio messages and diverts from course. At a certain point, \"it's declared an emergency and a supervisor dispatches the military,\" he said. Such calls normally are routine, he said.

Offering previously undisclosed details of the military's reaction to the terror attack, Maj. Gen. Paul Weaver, director of the Air National Guard, acknowledged that if the F-15s and F-16s had caught up with the hijacked passenger planes, their mission might have been futile. \"What does he do when he gets there? You're not going to get an American pilot shooting down an American airliner,\" Gen. Weaver said. \"We don't have permission to do that.\" Only the president could issue such an order, he confirmed in an impromptu hallway interview at the Pentagon. The Guard planes responded nevertheless, Gen. Weaver said, on orders from the Northeast Air Defense Sector in Rome, N.Y., which had been alerted by the Federal Aviation Administration. Pulling a chronology from his pocket, the general offered the following details, using Eastern Daylight Time: At 8:46 a.m., American Airlines Flight 11 from Boston's Logan Airport hit the North Tower of the World Trade Center. Seven minutes later, two F-15 fighters from Otis Air Force Base on Cape Cod, Mass., scrambled to chase the second plane that hit the trade center, United Airlines Flight 175, which had taken off from Boston at 8:14 a.m. and had deviated from its course. At that point, it was uncertain that Flight 175 had been hijacked, Gen. Weaver said, but the FAA had told the air defense sector that \"there was an airplane that had a problem.\" Nine minutes to impact By the time the F-15s were airborne, United 175 was nine minutes away from plowing into the south tower of the World Trade Center, and the fighter planes were more than 100 miles away. \"We had a nine-minute window, and we had in excess of 100 miles to intercept 175,\" Gen. Weaver said. \"There was just literally no way.\" The pilots flew \"like a scalded ape,\" topping 500 mph, but were unable to catch up to the airliner, Gen. Weaver said. After", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:010915dallasnews.txt:0:e9b55c1c00be", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 6764, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "010915dallasnews.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "010915dallasnews", "chunk_index": 1, "text": "time the F-15s were airborne, United 175 was nine minutes away from plowing into the south tower of the World Trade Center, and the fighter planes were more than 100 miles away. \"We had a nine-minute window, and we had in excess of 100 miles to intercept 175,\" Gen. Weaver said. \"There was just literally no way.\" The pilots flew \"like a scalded ape,\" topping 500 mph, but were unable to catch up to the airliner, Gen. Weaver said. After Flight 175 hit the trade center, the F-15s began circling New York City in case of further hijacked planes. American Airlines Flight 77, which would hit the Pentagon at 9:37 a.m., took off from Dulles International Airport near Washington at 8:10 a.m., flew west for 45 minutes, then turned east. \"Whoever was flying it had turned off the transponder,\" Gen. Weaver noted, referring to the device that identifies an airliner to air traffic control. \"They came back on the [radar] scope at 9:10 in West Virginia,\" Gen. Weaver said. With the F-15s that had scrambled from Otis Air Force Base about 350 miles away, Air Guard F-16 Falcon fighters from Langley Air Force Base, Va., were ordered to try to intercept American 77. The Northeast Air Defense Sector \"scrambled F-16s that were on alert at Langley Air Force Base at 9:35. The crash happened at 9:37,\" Gen. Weaver said. The F-16s then remained in the area, on patrol over the crippled Pentagon. 'No notification' No Air National Guard or other military planes were scrambled to chase the fourth hijacked airliner, United Airlines Flight 93, which took off at 8:10 a.m. from Newark International Airport in New Jersey, Gen. Weaver said. \"There was no notification for us to launch airplanes,\" he said. \"We weren't even close.\" United 93 flew to the Ohio border, then \"turned around real quick,\" the general said. The plane plunged into a field in southern Pennsylvania at 10:10 a.m. - apparently after passengers struggled with the hijackers. The transponder on that aircraft also was turned off, Gen. Weaver said. No regular Air Force planes were scrambled during the terrorist attacks because continental air defense is the mission of the Air National Guard, an Air Force spokesman said, speaking on condition of anonymity. Regular Air Force fighters \"have air superiority as their mission,\" the spokesman explained, meaning they train \"to deploy somewhere where we are engaged in hostile action and secure the skies.\" Those planes ordinarily are not ready to fly on short notice, and their pilots are not on standby to defend the United States, the spokesman said. Bases on alert During the Cold War, the Air National Guard and Air Force kept planes on \"strip alert\" - ready to fly within minutes - at more than 100 bases around the country, Gen. Weaver said. But with the decline of the Soviet threat, that number was drastically", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:010915dallasnews.txt:1:ca004770d48e", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 6765, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "010915dallasnews.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "010915dallasnews", "chunk_index": 2, "text": "action and secure the skies.\" Those planes ordinarily are not ready to fly on short notice, and their pilots are not on standby to defend the United States, the spokesman said. Bases on alert During the Cold War, the Air National Guard and Air Force kept planes on \"strip alert\" - ready to fly within minutes - at more than 100 bases around the country, Gen. Weaver said. But with the decline of the Soviet threat, that number was drastically reduced. Since 1997, the Air National Guard has kept two fighter planes on strip alert at only seven bases on the East, South and West coasts of the country to guard against threats coming from outside U.S. borders, Gen. Weaver said. For that reason, no Guard planes would have been able to intercept United 93 even if the order had been given, he added. Since Tuesday's events, the Defense Department has raised the number of bases where planes are on strip alert to 26. But it remains unclear what their pilots would do if terrorists again succeeded in taking over an airliner and turning it into a flying bomb. \"There are certain rules of engagement for a hijacked plane - if you know it's a hijacked plane - or a missing plane or off course,\" Gen. Weaver said. \"There's ways of getting their attention. But remember, this is an American carrier with American pilots and Americans on board. \"This is new territory for all of us.\" FAIR USE NOTICE: This site contains copyrighted material the use of which has not always been specifically authorized by the copyright owner.

THREE OF THE alleged hijackers listed their address on drivers licenses and car registrations as the Naval Air Station in Pensacola, Fla.-known as the \"Cradle of U.S. Navy Aviation,\" according to a high-ranking U.S. Navy source. Another of the alleged hijackers may have been trained in strategy and tactics at the Air War College in Montgomery, Ala., said another high-ranking Pentagon official. The fifth man may have received language instruction at Lackland Air Force Base in San Antonio, Tex. Both were former Saudi Air Force pilots who had come to the United States, according to the Pentagon source. But there are slight discrepancies between the military training records and the official FBI list of suspected hijackers-either in the spellings of their names or with their birthdates. One military source said it is possible that the hijackers may have stolen the identities of the foreign nationals who studied at the U.S. installations. The five men were on a list of 19 people identified as hijackers by the FBI on Friday. The three foreign nationals training in Pensacola appear to be Saeed Alghamdi and Ahmad Alnami, who were among the four men who allegedly commandeered United Airlines Flight 93. That flight crashed into rural Pennsylvania. The third man who may have trained in Pensacola, Ahmed Alghamdi, allegedly helped highjack United Airlines Flight 75, which hit the south tower of the World Trade Center. Military records show that the three used as their address 10 Radford Boulevard, a base roadway on which residences for foreign-military flight trainees are located. In March 1997, Saeed Alghamdi listed the address to register a 1998 Oldsmobile; five months later he used it again to register a second vehicle, a late model Buick. Drivers licenses thought to have been issued to the other two suspects in 1996 and 1998 list the barracks as their residences. NEWSWEEK visited the base early Saturday morning, where military police confirmed that the address housed foreign military flight trainees but denied access past front barricades. Officials at the base confirmed that the FBI is investigating the three students.

Officials at the base confirmed that the FBI is investigating the three students. It is not unusual for foreign nationals to train at U.S. military facilities. A former Navy pilot told NEWSWEEK that during his years on the base, \"we always, always, always trained other countries' pilots. When I was there two decades ago, it was Iranians. The shah was in power. Whoever the country du jour is, that's whose pilots we train.\" Candidates begin with \"an officer's equivalent of boot camp,\" he said. \"Then they would put them through flight training.\" The U.S. has a long-standing agreement with Saudi Arabia-a key ally in the 1990-91 gulf war-to train pilots for its National Guard. Candidates are trained in air combat on several Army and Navy bases. Training is paid for by Saudi Arabia.

The search here on Wednesday was widely reported in the news media, including The New York Times, with several accounts reporting that the pilot was a suspected hijacker. A lawyer with knowledge of the investigation said today that the man, Abdul Rahman Alomari, had returned to Saudi Arabia this month, and that both American and Saudi officials appear to be reasonably convinced that he is not the Abdulaziz al-Omari who was listed by the F.B.I. on Friday as one of the 19 hijackers. The lawyer, as well as American and Saudi officials, all of whom spoke on the condition that they not be named, said Abdul Rahman Alomari had been interviewed by Saudi and United States authorities in Saudi Arabia in the last two days. Federal law enforcement officials had little to say today. ''I just can't talk about the investigation,'' said Judy Orihuela, a spokeswoman for the bureau's Miami office. But another law enforcement official said investigators had concluded that the Alomari who had lived here -- an employee of Saudi Arabian Airlines who was attending flight school in Vero Beach -- was not the Alomari listed on the manifest of Flight 11. If that is the case, Abdul Rahman Alomari fell victim to a remarkable set of circumstances.

If that is the case, Abdul Rahman Alomari fell victim to a remarkable set of circumstances. Apart from the similarity in names, the interest of investigators was clearly aroused by the fact that he had studied at a Florida flight school, as had several of the suspected hijackers. Both investigators and reporters became further intrigued when Mr. Alomari's landlord and neighbors told them he had sent his wife and four children back to Saudi Arabia less than two weeks before the attack. A Saudi official said that the authorities in Saudi Arabia believed Mr. Alomari was who said he was. But the official said he could not definitively clear up the question of Mr. Alomari's identity and that Saudi authorities were investigating whether identity theft might have been involved. At 5:30 a.m. on Wednesday, some 60 F.B.I agents and local law enforcement officers swept into Mr. Alomari's former neighborhood here. They then searched the house for hours, as well as a neighboring house that had been rented by Adnan Bukhari, another pilot trainee from Saudi Arabia and a friend of Mr. Alomari's. Mr. Bukhari agreed to be flown to Miami for an interview at the F.B.I.'s office there, his lawyer said. Mr. Bukhari was allowed to return home Thursday night, the lawyer said. During the interview, Mr. Bukhari's cellphone rang, said the lawyer, who was present. Mr. Bukhari found Mr. Alomari on the line, calling from Saudi Arabia after hearing news reports that the two of them were considered suspects, the lawyer said. He asked the F.B.I. agent whether he wished to speak to Mr. Alomari and handed him the phone. -------------------- Shared Names for Hijackers (By The New York Times), WASHINGTON, Sept. 15 -- Three of the men identified as the hijackers in the attacks on Tuesday have the same names as alumni of American military schools, the authorities said today. The men were identified as Mohamed Atta, Abdulaziz al-Omari and Saeed al-Ghamdi. The Defense Department said Mr. Atta had gone to the International Officers School at Maxwell Air Force Base in Alabama; Mr. al-Omari to the Aerospace Medical School at Brooks Air Force Base in Texas; and Mr. al-Ghamdi to the Defense Language Institute at the Presidio in Monterey, Calif.

WALD (NYT) 1064 words WASHINGTON, Sept. 14 -- During the hour or so that American Airlines Flight 77 was under the control of hijackers, up to the moment it struck the west side of the Pentagon, military officials in a command center on the east side of the building were urgently talking to law enforcement and air traffic control officials about what to do. But despite elaborate plans that link civilian and military efforts to control the nation's airspace in defense of the country, and despite two other jetliners' having already hit the World Trade Center in New York, the fighter planes that scrambled into protective orbits around Washington did not arrive until 15 minutes after Flight 77 hit the Pentagon. Even if they had been there sooner, it is not clear what they would have done to thwart the attack. The Federal Aviation Administration has officially refused to discuss its procedures or the sequence of events on Tuesday morning, saying these are part of the Federal Bureau of Investigation's inquiry. But controllers in New England knew about 8:20 a.m. that American Airlines Flight 11, bound from Boston to Los Angeles, had probably been hijacked. When the first news report was made at 8:48 a.m. that a plane might have hit the World Trade Center, they knew it was Flight 11. And within a few minutes more, controllers would have known that both United 175 (the second plane to hit the World Trade Center) and American 77 (which hit the Pentagon) had probably been hijacked. Flight 77, which took off from Dulles International Airport outside Washington shortly after 8 a.m., stayed aloft until 9:45 a.m. and would have been visible on the F.A.A.'s radar system as it reversed course in the Midwest an hour later to fly back to Washington. The radars would have observed it even though its tracking beacon", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:010915nytimes11.txt:0:5dc31d578353", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 6774, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "010915nytimes11.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "010915nytimes11", "chunk_index": 1, "text": "that both United 175 (the second plane to hit the World Trade Center) and American 77 (which hit the Pentagon) had probably been hijacked. Flight 77, which took off from Dulles International Airport outside Washington shortly after 8 a.m., stayed aloft until 9:45 a.m. and would have been visible on the F.A.A.'s radar system as it reversed course in the Midwest an hour later to fly back to Washington. The radars would have observed it even though its tracking beacon had been turned off. By 9:25 a.m. the F.A.A., in consultation with the Pentagon, had taken the radical step of banning all takeoffs around the country, but fighters still had not been dispatched. At that same time, the government learned from Barbara Olson, a political commentator who was a passenger on Flight 77, that the plane had been hijacked. She twice called her husband, Solicitor General Theodore B. Olson, on her cellular phone to tell him what was happening. Despite provisions for close communication between civilian and military traffic officials, and extensive procedures for security control over air traffic during attacks on the United States, it does not appear that anyone had contemplated the kind of emergency that was unfolding. The procedures, first devised in the 1950's, cover how to send fighter planes to shadow a hijacked plane on its way, perhaps, to Cuba. They tell how to intercept a plane entering the nation's airspace through the air defense zone along the Atlantic Coast, but not what to do with kamikazes. ''There is no category of 'enemy airliners,' '' a recently retired F.A.A. official said. He and others said they could not recall any instance in which a military plane fired on a civilian one in the United States, though in 1983 a F-4 Phantom fighter that scrambled to intercept an unidentified target off Cherry Point, N.C., accidentally rammed it. That plane was a private twin-engine propeller plane on the way home from the Bahamas, carrying seven people. The United States is signatory to a treaty that appears to bar using force against civilian airplanes. Congress has voted against letting the military shoot down suspected drug planes trying to cross into the United States. Whether those restrictions would apply to a plane showing clearly hostile intent has never been spelled out. An F.A.A. spokeswoman said earlier this week that there was a policy for shooting down civilian airliners but would not divulge it. And shooting down a jet as large as a Boeing 757 or 767 raises other problems. One F.A.A. official said, ''If you keep it from hitting a government building, it's going to hit something else.'' That was clearly true for the planes that hit the World Trade Center, which flew over other parts of Manhattan, and the plane that hit the Pentagon, which flew over urbanized Northern Virginia.

That was clearly true for the planes that hit the World Trade Center, which flew over other parts of Manhattan, and the plane that hit the Pentagon, which flew over urbanized Northern Virginia. John S. Carr, president of the National Air Traffic Controllers Association, the controllers' union, said: ''Our system of unfettered access and freedom has limitations in terms of responding to a case like this. We've created a system for transportation, not defense.'' Today officials were trying to reconstruct that system. Ronald Reagan National Airport -- with approaches that are within a few hundred yards of the Pentagon and just seconds, at jet speeds, from the heart of Washington -- remains closed, ''temporarily and indefinitely.'' Private planes were allowed to resume flying at 4 p.m. today, but only under air traffic control. Combat aircraft are patrolling the skies; an aircraft carrier is at sea off Washington and another off New York to provide air defense. Military officials have offered vague descriptions in public about their procedures against airborne terrorists. In a confirmation hearing on Wednesday before the Senate Armed Services Committee, Gen. Richard B. Myer of the Air Force, who has been nominated to be chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said he did not know whether the F.A.A. had contacted the Pentagon about the hijackings. ''When it became clear what the threat was, we did scramble fighter aircraft, AWACS, radar aircraft and tanker aircraft to begin to establish orbits in case other aircraft showed up in the F.A.A. system that were hijacked,'' he said. He added that once the fighters were aloft, it was not necessary to use force. In part, that was because American Airlines Flight 77 had already hit the Pentagon, and the hijacked flight from Newark, its target unknown, had crashed in Pennsylvania. Paul Wolfowitz, the deputy defense secretary, said today that the Pentagon had been tracking that plane and could have shot it down if necessary; it crashed about 35 minutes after the Pentagon crash.

Fallis Washington Post Staff Writers * September 16, 2001; Page A29 Investigators yesterday arrested a second person as a material witness in the attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon, and have detained 25 people on immigration violations for questioning, the Justice Department said. A Justice Department official gave no details on the second arrest. On Friday, authorities arrested a man they were already holding on suspicion of having a false pilot's license. Justice Department spokeswoman Mindy Tucker said that none of the 25 detainees had been charged with a crime and that several were cooperating. Department sources said two of the 25 were stopped at an Amtrak station in Fort Worth with $5,000 in cash and a box cutter, the same kind of knife used by the 19 hijackers who crashed four planes last Tuesday. As the investigation gathered strength yesterday, unusual leads began to surface, among them the possibility that some of the hijackers may have received training at Pensacola Naval Air Station in Florida or other U.S. military facilities. **Two of 19 suspects named by the FBI, Saeed Alghamdi and Ahmed Alghamdi, have the same names as men listed at a housing facility for foreign military trainees at Pensacola. Two others, Hamza Alghamdi and Ahmed Alnami, have names similar to individuals listed in public records as using the same address inside the base. ** **In addition, a man named Saeed Alghamdi graduated from the Defense Language Institute at Lackland Air Force Base in San Antonio, while men with the same names as two other hijackers, Mohamed Atta and Abdulaziz Alomari, appear as graduates of the U.S. International Officers School at Maxwell Air Force Base, Ala., and the Aerospace Medical School at Brooks Air Force Base in San Antonio, respectively.** \"Some of the FBI suspects had names similar to those used by foreign alumni of U.S. military courses,\" the Air Force acknowledged", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:010916post.txt:0:4624c94326b8", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 6778, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "010916post.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "010916post", "chunk_index": 1, "text": "graduated from the Defense Language Institute at Lackland Air Force Base in San Antonio, while men with the same names as two other hijackers, Mohamed Atta and Abdulaziz Alomari, appear as graduates of the U.S. International Officers School at Maxwell Air Force Base, Ala., and the Aerospace Medical School at Brooks Air Force Base in San Antonio, respectively.** \"Some of the FBI suspects had names similar to those used by foreign alumni of U.S. military courses,\" the Air Force acknowledged in a statement. \"However, discrepancies in their biographical data, such as birth dates 20 years off, indicate we are probably not talking about the same people.\" Still, investigators built solid evidence on other suspects. In Germany, authorities linked a third hijacker to an alleged Islamic terrorist cell that operated in the northern city of Hamburg for years, and they seized \"airplane-related documents\" from his girlfriend's apartment. German authorities said that Ziad Jarrahi, 27, who was aboard the hijacked plane that crashed in Pennsylvania, had lived for the past four years in Hamburg, sharing an apartment with Atta and Marwan Al-Shehhi, another suspect. Jarrahi studied aircraft construction. U.S. officials also confirmed yesterday that Khalid Al-Midhar, identified as one of the hijackers aboard the flight that crashed into the Pentagon, was spotted on a surveillance videotape from Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, speaking with a suspect in last year's bombing of the destroyer USS Cole in the Yemeni port of Aden. The tape is another piece of circumstantial evidence linking the Sept. 11 attacks to exiled Saudi militant Osama bin Laden, who is suspected of masterminding the Cole bombing. In India, Saudi diplomat Ahmed Alshehri, based in Bombay, denied that he was the father of hijacker Waleed M. Alshehri or that he had ever served in the United States. Diplomatic lists, however, show an Ahmed Alshehri as second secretary at the Saudi Embassy in Washington, and property records, law enforcement sources and witnesses have linked him with Waleed. Reports from a Saudi newspaper editor said yesterday that both Waleed and Wail Alshehri, another hijacker, were Ahmed's sons. After the Justice Department released the names of the hijackers Friday, ordinary people began to realize, to their surprise, that they had encountered the suspects in their final days and hours. At the Panther Motel, in Deerfield Beach, Fla., Richard Surma and his wife, Diane, remembered that hijacker Marwan Al-Shehhi and a man whose name they did not know had been their guests between Aug. 26 and Sept. 9.

In Fort Lee, N.J., Dave Hascup, manager of a Mail Boxes Etc. store in the Linwood Plaza Mall, said FBI and police officers interviewed him Wednesday about hijackers Nawaq Alhamzi and Salem Alhamzi, whom authorities said had a mailbox there. \"I sat in the back while [the FBI agents] checked the mailbox,\" Hascup said. \"There are just some things you don't want to know.\" Elsewhere, it was the incongruities that caught the attention of investigators. In Weehauken, N.J., authorities said teams of FBI agents searched a warehouse owned by Urban Moving Systems after neighbors spotted several employees jumping up and down in celebration soon after the World Trade Center attacks. In Union City, N.J., FBI agents went door to door late Tuesday night and early Wednesday evening at the Doric, a high-rise apartment building, interviewing tenants and showing them photos of about a half dozen men who appeared to be in their late twenties or early thirties and of Middle Eastern descent. The agents arrived after a Doric resident saw five men in the area of the apartment building, which had a good view of the World Trade Center, either taking photos or videotaping scenes from across the river shortly after the attack. The Justice Department's Tucker said investigators across the country have conducted \"hundreds of interviews.\" The first formal arrest came Friday, when a man was stopped at New York's John F. Kennedy International Airport for having a false pilot's license. Tucker said a second arrest warrant was issued yesterday and the suspect taken into custody in New York. Officials declined to name either witness and said the records were sealed. Federal investigators had hoped to obtain critical information about the hijackings from the downed planes' \"black boxes,\" but the recorders on the jets that crashed into the Pentagon and into rural Pennsylvania were badly damaged, Tucker said, and are being returned to the manufacturer in hopes that some data can be retrieved. According to the Justice Department, there were cracks in the circuit boards of both of the black boxes aboard Flight 93. Meanwhile, the Immigration and Naturalization Service was holding 25 people on a variety of infractions and questioning all of them about the Sept. 11 attacks, Tucker said.

The two men detained Wednesday in Fort Worth were sent to New York. Lori Bailey, an FBI spokeswoman in Dallas, said the two Fort Worth detainees were taken off the train by Drug Enforcement Administration agents conducting a routine narcotics sweep. They were riding from St. Louis, apparently having disembarked from an aircraft, and were en route to San Antonio, she said. The pair told agents they were from India but had no documents. They were carrying $5,000 in cash and a box cutter, Bailey said. In Maine, Portland Police Chief Michael Chitwood said yesterday that police and the FBI combed the city's Jetport parking lot before dawn Wednesday until they found the metallic blue rental Nissan Altima driven by Alomari and Mohamed Atta, then handed it over to FBI technicians who arrived early Thursday and worked on it until 9 p.m. At Boston's Logan Airport, investigators discovered a bag left behind by Atta and containing a Saudi passport, an international driver's license, instructional videos for flying Boeing airliners, an Islamic prayer schedule and a suicide note written in Arabic, a source familiar with the investigation said. And, in a security sweep of the Logan parking garage at 2 a.m. Thursday, investigators found a box cutter, a pamphlet written in Arabic and a credit card, items apparently discarded by the terrorists as they entered the airport. Documents sent by the FBI to German police, and obtained by the German magazine Der Spiegel, indicate that some of the suspected hijackers aboard the plane that crashed into the Pentagon had purchased their tickets in tandem and through the most ordinary means. Khalid Al-Midhar used a Daytona Beach address to book a reservation over the American Airlines Web site, using his frequent-flier number, which he had established the day before, according to FBI documents cited by the German magazine. He picked up the ticket at the Baltimore-Washington International Airport on Sept. 5, paying cash. His assigned seat was 12B. Staff writers Marcia Slacum Greene, Scott Higham, Sari Horwitz, Serge F.

Reuters news service and the Los Angeles Times published reports estimating them at 3,000 to 4,000. They include the agency's major inquiry into the manner in which investment banks divvied up hot shares of initial public offerings during the high-tech boom. ** **The EEOC said documents from about 45 active cases were missing and could not be easily retrieved from any backup system.** One of these cases was a sexual harassment charge filed on Sept. 10 against Morgan Stanley, one of the prime corporate victims of the World Trade Center disaster. A statement from the commission said that \"we are confident that we will not lose any significant investigation or case as a result of the loss of our building in New York. No one whom we have sued or whose conduct we have been investigating should doubt our resolve to continue our pursuit of justice in every such matters.\" But the short-term problems will be immense, said Gregory Joseph of New York's Law Offices of Gregory Joseph. \"Court papers can largely be reconstituted, but work product has to be reconstructed,\" he said. \"This will cause delays in court and will require significant reduplication of effort.\" Some data, he added, \"won't be recreatable.\" \"Ongoing investigations at the New York SEC will be dramatically affected because so much of their work is paper-intensive,\" said Max Berger of New York's Bernstein Litowitz Berger & Grossmann. \"This is a disaster for these cases.\" \"The SEC will have some difficulty, but the bounce-back will come relatively easily,\" predicts Harvey Goldschmid, Dwight professor of law at Columbia University and former general counsel of the SEC. \"It will throw things off for", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:010917nylawyerwallstreetsecfiles.txt:0:68c038dbee20", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 6783, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "010917nylawyerwallstreetsecfiles.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "010917nylawyerwallstreetsecfiles", "chunk_index": 1, "text": "Some data, he added, \"won't be recreatable.\" \"Ongoing investigations at the New York SEC will be dramatically affected because so much of their work is paper-intensive,\" said Max Berger of New York's Bernstein Litowitz Berger & Grossmann. \"This is a disaster for these cases.\" \"The SEC will have some difficulty, but the bounce-back will come relatively easily,\" predicts Harvey Goldschmid, Dwight professor of law at Columbia University and former general counsel of the SEC. \"It will throw things off for a period of time, but most of what's important can be regained. They will have to reconstruct these documents. But most of this was backed up or in Washington. They've lost some transcripts but even they're available.\" ** EEOC Records Destroyed ** The EEOC's New York office, which was housed in 7 World Trade Center, sustained no loss of life. But all the agency's records were destroyed. Many of the files are backed up in the computer system, but a substantial number of documents are simply gone, said Spencer Lewis, the EEOC district director. Depositions and notes were not scanned into computers and are lost. With depositions and interviews, the agency will be contacting court reporters \"and hoping that they've got them so we can reconstruct files,\" Lewis said. This covers about 45 active cases, including a recent action against Morgan Stanley. But employment litigators believe the effect here, too, will be transitory. \"The EEOC is decimated as far as office space goes,\" but any problems are \"only short-term,\" said Michael Weber of the New York office of Littler Mendelson. \"They will get back to business.\" The agencies will be seeking documents from the private law firms and defendants, Weber notes. \"My sense is that we will cooperate,\" he noted. \"Our goal is not to take advantage of this catastrophe.\" \"A lot of their records they'll have online, so they'll just reprint them out,\" adds Harkins. \"The EEOC is in a better position than the SEC, because the SEC has a lot more confidential files.\" FAIR USE NOTICE: This site contains copyrighted material the use of which has not always been specifically authorized by the copyright owner.

Law enforcement officials said they were taking the possibility of other hijack targets seriously, based on information from several sources, including citizens' tips and information from cooperating witnesses. One flight under investigation is American Airlines Flight 43, which left Newark International Airport about 8:10 a.m. bound for Los Angeles; it made an emergency landing in Cincinnati after the government ordered all flights grounded. The other flight is American Airlines Flight 1729 from Newark to San Antonio via Dallas that was scheduled to depart at 8:50 a.m. and was later forced to land at St. Louis. Attorney General John Ashcroft acknowledged that the authorities were investigating whether other aircraft besides the four might have been targeted. But, Mr. Ashcroft added, ''we are not able at this time to confirm that.'' Mr. Ashcroft said that 75 people who might have information in the case were in custody on immigration charges, and reports of new arrests came in today from Los Angeles, Detroit and Orlando, Fla. As investigators continued to make arrests and conduct searches, law enforcement officials acknowledged that the F.B.I.'s efforts to conduct electronic surveillance of foreign terrorists in the United States had been troubled in recent months, prompting an internal inquiry into possible abuses. Justice Department and F.B.I. officials, who acknowledged the existence of the internal investigation, said the inquiry had forced officials to examine their monitoring of several suspected terrorist groups, among them Al Qaeda, the network led by Osama bin Laden, and Hamas, the militant Palestinian group. Al Qaeda is the group that", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:010919nytimes.txt:0:6121f449fd7f", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 6786, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "010919nytimes.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "010919nytimes", "chunk_index": 1, "text": "acknowledged that the F.B.I.'s efforts to conduct electronic surveillance of foreign terrorists in the United States had been troubled in recent months, prompting an internal inquiry into possible abuses. Justice Department and F.B.I. officials, who acknowledged the existence of the internal investigation, said the inquiry had forced officials to examine their monitoring of several suspected terrorist groups, among them Al Qaeda, the network led by Osama bin Laden, and Hamas, the militant Palestinian group. Al Qaeda is the group that President Bush and others have cited for last week's attacks. Senior F.B.I. and Justice Department officials said that they had not allowed the internal investigation of terrorism-related wiretaps to affect their ability to monitor Al Qaeda or Hamas. But other officials said the inquiry might have hampered electronic surveillance of terror groups. The matter remains highly classified. The officials said the internal inquiry was opened in part because of legal problems arising from the government's investigation into the 1998 bombings of two American Embassies in East Africa, involving Al Qaeda members Today, law enforcement officials said that the evidence of a broader plot in the airliner hijackings was suggestive but inconsistent. In the case of American Airlines Flight 1729, the authorities have detained two men from the flight who were arrested aboard an Amtrak train in Fort Worth after their flight had been forced to land in St. Louis. The two men, identified as Ayubali Ali Kahn and Mohammed Jaweed Azmath, were the only people aboard the flight who appeared to be suspicious; each of the other flights had hijack teams of four or five men. A senior F.B.I. official said today that the authorities were examining hundreds of e-mail messages to and from the suspected hijackers and their known associates. The messages were mainly in English and Arabic, said the official, who would not describe the content aside from saying that the messages were provided by large Internet service providers. American intelligence officials also said today that they had received a report that Mohamed Atta, a suspected hijacker on American Airlines Flight 11, which struck the World Trade Center North Tower, met several months ago with an Iraqi intelligence official in Europe. The American officials said the report of the meeting had been received in the last few days. The officials said they were not sure of the purpose of the meeting, if it did occur, and were investigating the possible connection. They emphasized that it did not prove that Iraq played a role in the attacks. In addition to the two men who were arrested on the Amtrak train and taken to New York as material witnesses in the investigation, federal agents have also taken to New York for questioning a man who was arrested in Minnesota in mid-August on a passport violation after he sought training on a airplane flight simulator.

In addition to the two men who were arrested on the Amtrak train and taken to New York as material witnesses in the investigation, federal agents have also taken to New York for questioning a man who was arrested in Minnesota in mid-August on a passport violation after he sought training on a airplane flight simulator. The man, Zacarias Moussaoui, apparently raised suspicion at the Pan Am International Flight Academy in Eagan, Minn., although officials with the academy have declined to describe why. Within days of Mr. Moussaoui's arrest, federal agents showed up at the Airman Flight School in Oklahoma, where he had enrolled earlier in the year, said Dale Davis, director of operations at the flight school. Mr. Davis said the agents took copies of Mr. Moussaoui's immigration form and asked, among other things, whether Mr. Moussaoui had ever made anti-American statements. Mr. Davis said he told the agents that Mr. Moussaoui had not. At the same time, investigators appeared to be uncertain about the scope of the entire operation, particularly in cities outside the Northeast. Several connections to San Antonio have been developed. Albader Alhazmi, a 34-year-old radiologist from San Antonio, is being held in New York as a material witness, one official said. Dr. Alhazmi's home and workplace have been searched. The internal debate at the Justice Department and F.B.I. over wiretap surveillance of terrorist groups ignited in March, prompted by questions raised by Royce C. Lamberth, the chief judge of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court, a little-known panel that decides whether to approve Justice Department applications to permit wiretaps and clandestine searches in espionage and international terror cases. In a letter to Attorney General Ashcroft, Judge Lamberth raised questions about a wiretap request related to a Hamas member, officials said. Under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, the F.B.I. must make applications, through the Justice Department, to the surveillance court to authorize wiretaps and clandestine searches of the homes and offices of suspected terrorists and spies. The foreign surveillance act, passed in 1978 in the wake of Watergate and other revelations of abuses by the F.B.I. and C.I.A., created a legal framework to allow the government to eavesdrop on people considered dangerous to American national security, even if prosecutors had not yet developed a criminal case against them. The legal standards that the F.B.I. must meet to obtain court authorization under the act are lower than the probable cause required under most criminal cases. But that flexibility comes with a cost: information gathered under the act can be used only in criminal cases under highly limited conditions. Civil liberties advocates have frequently expressed concerns about whether the act allows the government to blur the lines between intelligence gathering and criminal prosecutions.

Civil liberties advocates have frequently expressed concerns about whether the act allows the government to blur the lines between intelligence gathering and criminal prosecutions. Judge Lamberth's concerns about F.B.I. applications to the court are apparently related to whether the bureau was seeking wiretaps under the act on individuals without informing the court of a subject's status pending criminal investigations. The Bush administration team at the Justice Department reacted to Judge Lamberth's complaints by opening an inquiry into Michael Resnick, an F.B.I. official who coordinates the act's applications. Mr. Ashcroft and Robert S. Mueller III, now director of the F.B.I., who at the time was temporarily serving as deputy attorney general, ordered a review of foreign surveillance authorizations. Louis J. Freeh, who was then the F.B.I. director, and Lawrence Parkinson, the bureau's general counsel, ordered a review of several applications in terrorism cases dating back several years. Disclosure of the internal investigation of the foreign intelligence process comes just as Mr. Ashcroft is seeking Congressional support for an emergency package of anti-terrorism legislation, including an expansion of the Justice Department's ability to use wiretaps in cases of suspected terrorism or espionage. Under his proposal, law enforcement agents would have broad authority to conduct roving electronic surveillance of suspected terrorists as they move from phone to phone or from computer terminal to computer terminal. Some officials argue that the current system imposes burdens on the F.B.I. and Justice Department as they seek to obtain wiretaps of suspected terrorists. Under the foreign intelligence act, electronic surveillance authorization must be renewed by the F.I.S.A. court every 90 days, and authorization for physical search warrants must be renewed by the court every 45 days. Applications surged after Tuesday's attacks, officials said.

Dozens of Saudi citizens were flown back to Saudi Arabia at their government's expense, while the bin Ladens are believed to have paid their own way, according to a Saudi diplomat. All of those who took up the Saudi government's offer to fly home were reportedly questioned by the FBI before being allowed to board the flights. A Saudi diplomat told The Boston Globe that the relatives of bin Laden had been advised by both the Saudi government and the FBI to return to Saudi Arabia at least temporarily for their own safety. All of Osama bin Laden's relatives, members of one of Saudi Arabia's richest families, have publicly disowned him and renounced his extremist views and his Al Qaeda terror organization, which advocates the killing of Americans in a jihad, or holy war. In Washington last night, an FBI spokesman refused to confirm or deny that the FBI approved the Saudi government's repatriation program or had advised the bin Ladens to return to Saudi Arabia. Nor would the spokesman say if the FBI was interviewing anyone who took part in it to rule them out as suspects in the biggest criminal investigation in US history. Special Agent Gail Marcinkiewicz, a spokeswoman for the Boston FBI office, also declined to comment. It was unclear how many members of bin Laden's family flew home over the last two days, but **aviation sources said a flight that left Logan on Tuesday night contained only five passengers, all of whom were said to be members of bin Laden's family. ** A Saudi government spokesman said the plane used by the bin Ladens was privately chartered by the family. Sources familiar with that plane said it was a Boeing 727 that had been reconfigured so that it had only about 30 first-class seats.

Sources familiar with that plane said it was a Boeing 727 that had been reconfigured so that it had only about 30 first-class seats. A second flight, paid for by the Saudi government, was scheduled to depart Logan last night, after making stops in other cities, including Los Angeles and Orlando. A Saudi government spokesman said that, as of yesterday afternoon, more than 20 Saudi citizens had accepted the offer for a free trip home, but he said the number could grow. A source at Logan said that the FBI was \"all over these planes\" prior to takeoff, but the Saudi government said no one has been refused permission by the FBI to return to Saudi Arabia. While the FBI has repeatedly searched Flagship Wharf, the Charlestown condominium complex where one of bin Laden's brothers, Mohammaed, owns six luxury apartments, and where some of the relatives live, a Saudi diplomat yesterday said there is no indication that bin Laden's relatives are considered suspects. The diplomat, who spoke from the Saudi Embassy in Washington on the condition he was not named, said the FBI would not have allowed the relatives to leave the United States if there was any evidence that would link them to the plot. Barry Scheer, a lawyer for Mohammaed M. bin Laden, said he does not know how many members of the family left the Boston area. Osama bin Laden has 51 siblings and is the scion of a large, wealthy family whose father was a favored contractor for the Saudi royal family. Several of Osama's relatives have resided on and off in Boston during the past decade. After Osama bin Laden was implicated last year in the attack on the USS Cole in Yemen that left 17 sailors dead, the FBI searched some of Mohammaed M. bin Laden's condo units at Flagship Wharf. After last Tuesday's suicide hijackings, the FBI returned to the Charlestown complex, and began asking questions about the relatives. A Saudi government spokesman said the FBI interest in the bin Laden relatives was \"routine,\" and was aimed at ruling them out as suspects rather than the product of any evidence suggesting their involvement. Another brother of bin Laden, Abdullah M. bin Laden, is a 1994 graduate of Harvard Law School and lives in Cambridge. He did not return telephone messages left at his home. There are several bin Laden relatives attending college in Boston and other parts of New England. Earlier this week, Faisal bin Laden, Osama bin Laden's nephew, left the University of New Hampshire, where he is a freshman.

Earlier this week, Faisal bin Laden, Osama bin Laden's nephew, left the University of New Hampshire, where he is a freshman. But he told friends he planned to return to the Durham campus, sources said. The Saudi government is worried about an anti-Arab backlash against its citizens. Those concerns are heightened because many of the 19 hijackers used either Saudi passports or affiliations with the Saudi national airline, Saudi Arabian Airlines, to gain entry to the United States and access to the flight schools. The Saudi government, one of the staunchest Arab allies of the United States, stopped sending its citizens to the United States for medical treatment after last week's attack. One diplomat said a Saudi citizen with the same name as one of the hijackers called him in tears from his hospital bed yesterday, saying he feared for his life. \"It's terribly sad,\" the diplomat said. The Saudi diplomat said his government had advised Saudi citizens, including some 3,000 students attending universities and medical schools around the United States, to be vigilant against possible retaliatory violence. A 20-year-old Saudi man who is studying at Boston University was stabbed early Sunday morning outside a Back Bay nightclub, Club Nicole, at the Back Bay Hilton. His wounds were not life-threatening, police said. Police are trying to determine whether the attack was motivated because of the victim's nationality. **The Saudi diplomat said that while his government and the FBI had advised the bin Ladens to return home for their safety, they had not recommended that other Saudis return home.** \"We have advised our citizens to be careful, but to go on with their lives,\" he said. \"We told them to use common sense, to avoid bars. Don't go to areas where people might get rowdy.\" He said the Boston knife attack was the only case the embassy knows of violence directed at Saudis, but there have been reports of verbal assaults across the nation. In addition, the Saudi diplomat said three Saudi citizens were briefly detained last week after a high-profile storming of a hotel room at the Copley Place Westin Hotel. He said police went to the hotel after one of the Saudis used a credit card to rent a car at the hotel. The name on the card was Attar, which was similar to the name of Mohamed Atta, the man who authorities believe was the ringleader of the Boston hijackers.

Edition 5LTHU 20 SEP 2001, Page 3 ** Suicide hijackers hid behind stolen Arab identities; America at war: New York agony; Terror in new York** **DOMINIC KENNEDY; OVERSEAS NEWS** Five of the hijackers were using stolen identities, and investigators are studying the possibility that the entire suicide squad consisted of impostors. Details are emerging of the killers' humdrum final weeks in the US suburbs - joining gyms, eating pizzas and visiting an \"adult video\" store. But the more the FBI learns about the dead men, the less likely it seems that the list of suspects derived from the passenger manifests of the aircraft can be accurate. Many of them seem to have adopted the personas of real-life commercial and military pilots. In Saudi Arabia, five of the alleged hijackers have emerged, alive, innocent and astonished to see their names and photographs appearing on satellite television. **\"The name is my name and the birth date is the same as mine, but I am not the one who bombed the World Trade Centre in New York,\"** Abdulaziz Alomari told the London-based Asharq al-Awsat newspaper. Mr Alomari, 28, interviewed in Riyadh, said that he had left the United States in April 2000 and was in the Saudi capital during the suicide attacks in New York and Washington. The US-educated engineer had reported to police that his passport was stolen when his flat in Denver, Colorado, was burgled in 1995. A Saudi diplomat formerly based in Washington, Ahmed al-Shehri, told al-Eqtisadiah newspaper that details of one of the hijackers matched his son, Waleed. The young man, a pilot with Saudi Arabian Airlines who graduated four years ago from Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University in Florida, is living in Morocco. **Another Saudi pilot, Said Hussein al-Ghamdi, whose photograph was broadcast on CNN when it portrayed him as a hijacker, is living in Tunis.** Bogus identities have long formed part of Osama bin Laden's armoury. A man given a jail sentence of 240 years for the 1993 bombing of the World Trade Centre is known to the American authorities as Ramzi Yousef, a Kuwaiti who studied at Swansea Institute of Higher Education. His lecturers insist, after seeing photographs of the man in a top-security jail, that he is not their former student. The real Mr Yousef was killed at the end of the", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:010920londontimes.hijackers.txt:0:40a0989dd0b6", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 6795, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "010920londontimes.hijackers.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "010920londontimes.hijackers", "chunk_index": 1, "text": "Tunis.** Bogus identities have long formed part of Osama bin Laden's armoury. A man given a jail sentence of 240 years for the 1993 bombing of the World Trade Centre is known to the American authorities as Ramzi Yousef, a Kuwaiti who studied at Swansea Institute of Higher Education. His lecturers insist, after seeing photographs of the man in a top-security jail, that he is not their former student. The real Mr Yousef was killed at the end of the Gulf War. One suspected associate of the hijackers questioned by police in America uses the name Nikos Makrakis, but the real Mr Makrakis is a Greek nightclub singer whose passport was stolen from his car when he went for a swim in Loutsa this July. Doubts are emerging about the identities of other named hijackers. In the United Arab Emirates, relatives and neighbours of Marwan al-Shehhi, suspected of flying the second aircraft into the towers, said the man they knew could not have carried out such a devastating act. Mr al-Shehhi, who last spoke to his family two months ago, lost his passport and a replacement was issued on December 26, 1999. The family of Ziad al-Jarrah, an alcohol-drinking Lebanese partygoer, deny he could have been the fanatical Muslim hijacker whose aircraft crashed in Pennsylvania. Mohammed Atta's father, a Cairo lawyer, was certain his son, who feared flying, was not the pilot of the first aircraft to crash into the World Trade Centre, as news organisations have suggested. **Alarming reports claimed that three of the hijackers -Saeed al-Ghamdi, Ahmed al-Mani and Ahmed al-Ghamdi -had learned to fly at the Naval Air Station in Pensacola, Florida, known as the \"Cradle of US Naval Aviation\".** But it has emerged that none of these were among the hijackers. Investigators are checking whether they were just men with similar names, or if the hijackers deliberately posed as the military pilots. The theft of identities from international commercial pilots may explain why some countries are discovering records showing that people with these names frequently entered their countries. The Philippines Government was astonished to learn that a Saeed al-Ghamdi had visited Manila 15 times. An Ahmed al Ghamdi came to the capital 13 times and left on September 10, a day before a man with the same name crashed into the World Trade Centre. The lives of the hijackers are being pieced together by FBI agents. Two of the gang, including the impostor Saeed al-Ghamdi, spent their final weeks in a flat in Delray Racquet Club, Delray Beach, Florida, where neighbours said it sounded like they were playing marbles late at night. Five of the men lived in suburban Maryland, where Hani Hanjour and Majed Moqed were pictured by a surveillance camera, in casual clothes. Moqed visited an adult video shop a few times, buying nothing. \"He was acting strangely. He looked nervous,\" the manager said.", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:010920londontimes.hijackers.txt:1:198f8ebf5061", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 6796, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "010920londontimes.hijackers.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "010920londontimes.hijackers", "chunk_index": 2, "text": "Two of the gang, including the impostor Saeed al-Ghamdi, spent their final weeks in a flat in Delray Racquet Club, Delray Beach, Florida, where neighbours said it sounded like they were playing marbles late at night.

Moqed visited an adult video shop a few times, buying nothing. \"He was acting strangely. He looked nervous,\" the manager said. Two of the hijackers lived in the Valencia Motel in Laurel, refusing to let the housekeeper enter their room to change the linen. They opened the door slightly to swap dirty towels for clean ones. The men ate at a pizza restauarant, but were described as \"stand-offish\". They went to Gold's Gym, paying with cash. They exercised quietly, using weight-training and resis-tance machines. When they enrolled, the receptionist asked if their Arabic names had English translations. Hanjour said: \"My name means warrior.\" Actually, it means \"content\". ** Special Note from WantToKnow.info:** The individuals mentioned above were later officially established in the 9/11 Commission Report as the 9/11 hijackers, even though they had confirmed their photographs and that they are still alive.

Even though the CIA had alerted other federal agencies 19 days earlier that Al-Midhar posed a threat, even though the FBI was searching for him nationwide, apparently nobody told American Airlines. So Al-Midhar just did the same things any tourist or business traveler would do. He logged on to American's Web site and made a reservation under that name on Flight 77 from Washington to Los Angeles, using his frequent-flyer number. Six days before the hijacking, he picked up his ticket at a Baltimore airport and paid cash. On Sept. 11 he walked through airport security at Washington Dulles International and onto the plane without any problems - along with a second hijacker, known as Nawaf Al-Hamzi, who also had been listed since Aug. 23 on the same federal \"watch list\" of terrorist suspects. The ease with which the men federal agencies had linked to terrorism boarded Flight 77 illustrates one of several apparent lapses by federal agencies that affected the Sept. 11 crisis. As new details have emerged about government efforts to deal with the attacks - and with the threat of terrorism in general - some of the information is raising pointed questions about how civilian and military agencies handled their roles during and prior to the crisis. As the country moves from shock and anger to a search for lessons on how to strengthen national security, such questions are likely to be examined in detail on Capitol Hill, several members of Congress said late last week. House Minority Leader Richard Gephardt (D-Mo.) said congressional hearings probably will examine shortcomings in how the government dealt with the crisis and new ways to safeguard air travel and protect major potential targets of terrorists.

The Sept. 11 suicide hijackings were unlike any previous terrorist incident government officials have had to handle, and senior military officers acknowledge that the armed services hadn't planned for such an attack. \"We want to do better than we did [on Sept. 11],\" he said. \"And the only way you're going to do better is to understand where we all failed and what can be done to improve our performance, to improve procedures, to improve laws, to improve the performance of everybody who works for all of these agencies that have strong responsibilities.\" The story of Flight 77 - pieced together from government records, news reports and interviews with military and civilian officials - suggests that faulty communications among agencies, delays in some key actions and weaknesses in military preparedness all figured in the way the disaster unfolded. Many of the questions center on two phases of the crisis that involved Flight 77: About 8:55 a.m. Flight 77 was flying west over southern Ohio when it abruptly turned and headed back toward Washington. At this time, the Federal Aviation Administration already had notified the military that two other airliners, the ones that struck the World Trade Center, apparently had been hijacked and had veered from their expected courses. But the FAA temporarily lost track of Flight 77, after the terrorists turned off its transponder, and about 29 minutes went by before the FAA alerted the military to the new threat from the airliner, which was carrying Al-Midhar, Al-Hamzi and three other hijackers. No attempt was made to evacuate the Pentagon before the plane struck it. The crash killed 125 people in the Pentagon and all 64 people on the plane. Twice during the crisis, the military launched fighter jets that raced toward the hijacked planes. Two F-15 fighters raced toward New York City; two F-16s sped toward Washington. But the number of air bases where fighter planes are kept on alert has dwindled sharply in recent years, one of the generals who runs the system told Newsday. And on Sept. 11, they no longer included any bases close to two obvious terrorist targets - Washington, D.C., and New York City. So the military had to use planes from air bases considerable distances away from the two cities. The fighters dispatched to New York came from Otis Air National Guard Base on Cape Cod, Mass., 153 miles from the World Trade Center. When the second tower of the World Trade Center was struck by a hijacked airliner, United Airlines Flight 175, at 9:02 a.m., the planes from Cape Cod", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:010923newsday.txt:1:a6dcf9481a16", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 6800, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "010923newsday.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "010923newsday", "chunk_index": 2, "text": "to two obvious terrorist targets - Washington, D.C., and New York City. So the military had to use planes from air bases considerable distances away from the two cities. The fighters dispatched to New York came from Otis Air National Guard Base on Cape Cod, Mass., 153 miles from the World Trade Center. When the second tower of the World Trade Center was struck by a hijacked airliner, United Airlines Flight 175, at 9:02 a.m., the planes from Cape Cod were still 71 miles away, about eight minutes behind the terrorists. The fighter jets launched toward Washington took off not from Andrews Air Force Base, 15 miles from the capital, but from Langley Air Force Base near Hampton, Va., 130 miles from Washington. When Flight 77 smashed into the Pentagon at 9:37 a.m., those fighters were still 105 miles from the scene. At that point, the fourth hijacked plane, United Airlines Flight 93, also had turned around on its way to San Francisco and headed toward Washington. It crashed in Pennsylvania at 10:03 a.m. after passengers reportedly fought with hijackers. Vice President Dick Cheney has disclosed that President George W. Bush authorized military jets to shoot down \"as a last resort\" a hijacked airliner, apparently Flight 93, that was heading for Washington. Officials said later that the decision wasn't made until after Flight 77 crashed into the Pentagon. These are some of the questions about the government's handling of the crisis and the circumstances surrounding them: Did critical information get from the FAA to the military quickly enough? The record suggests that teenagers on instant-message networks communicate faster than some federal officials did during the crisis. After losing track of Flight 77 for about 10 minutes, the FAA rediscovered the plane heading east over West Virginia, then took about 19 more minutes to alert the military. When Flight 77 hit the Pentagon, the fighter jets from Langley were 12 minutes away, the military says. Should terrorists be able to shut off an airliner's transponders? That's what happened on Flight 77. Transponders send out a signal giving a plane's position and identity. The simple action of turning them off appears to have given the Flight 77 terrorists about 10 minutes of valuable invisibility as they sped toward Washington. Although officials say transponders need an on-off switch for fire-safety reasons, one aviation expert told Newsday that a simple modification could alert air traffic controllers whenever a specific transponder is shut off. That would alert them that there might be a problem and give them a better chance to continue tracking the plane with radar, he said.

Are federal intelligence and law enforcement agencies doing enough with the information on their \"watch lists\" of suspected terrorists? Officials say airlines are sometimes warned about specific suspects and sometimes they aren't. Terrorists sometimes use phony names, which muddies the picture. But a computer analysis of one watch list obtained by Newsday suggests a potentially ominous finding: that besides the Sept. 11 hijackers, at least 10 more terrorist suspects, who may still be in the United States, are trained as pilots. Should the FAA act faster to close the nation's airports in a major crisis? As the air traffic control system faltered while tracking four hijacked planes, the FAA ordered airport closings in a series of stages during the 24 minutes after the second World Trade Center impact. During that period, at least several hundred more airliners, cargo planes and smaller aircraft continued to take off, at a time when no one knew if more hijackers were on board some of them, according to a Newsday analysis of federal Departmen of Transportation flight data. Why weren't Pentagon leaders alerted and employees evacuated? **Although the military's air defense command got word from the FAA about 13 minutes before Flight 77's crash that a hijacked airliner was streaking toward Washington, Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld and his top aides remained unaware of any danger up to the moment of impact, officials said. After learning of the World Trade Center attacks, Rumsfeld remained in his office, and Pentagon security officials took no steps to alert or evacuate the building's 20,000 employees.** Neither the White House nor Congress were evacuated, either. The hijacking of four airliners by terrorists planning to crash the planes was unprecedented, and officials say any assessment of government responses has to recognize that agencies had only a short time to deal with a staggering, multifaceted threat that nobody else in history had ever faced. Previous hijackings have been carried out by hijackers who wanted to land safely. The military has released information on its response times, but an FAA spokesman told Newsday that because the attacks are under investigation, the agency is not discussing the timing of its alerts to the military. Several members of Congress told Newsday they expect oversight hearings into the crisis. Rep. John McHugh (R-Watertown), an Armed Services Committee member, said: \"Our committee will unquestionably look at what the shortcomings were in defense.\" Rep. John Boehner (R-Ohio), a veteran House member, said: \"We'll see a very methodical review about what we did well, and what we could do better.\" **Problems With Watch Lists** For years, federal intelligence and law-enforcement agencies have compiled watch lists of suspected criminals and possible terrorist figures.

They are circulated among agencies that include the FBI, the CIA, the Customs Service and the Immigration and Naturalization Service. The aim is to alert agents who might want to detain or question suspects when they enter the United States. Two of the Flight 77 hijackers, Al-Midhar and Al-Hamzi, had been on a watch list circulating among agencies since Aug. 23, federal agents said. Agents said the two names had been supplied by the CIA because of a possible link between them and Osama bin Laden, the Saudi-born millionaire suspected of planning and financing many terrorist operations including the Sept. 11 attack. Officials said the CIA had obtained a videotape of the two men meeting in Malaysia with operatives for bin Laden in January 2000, and that Al-Midhar's name also had emerged in the ongoing investigation into the bombing of the destroyer Cole in Yemen in October 2000. It isn't known whether the two terrorists had been on any previous watch lists or, if not, why the intelligence information collected about them last year wasn't circulated until Aug. 23. The CIA refused to comment. A U.S. official, who would speak only if his agency wasn't identified, said the CIA had gotten additional information this year, but the official would not say what it was. He said the CIA had \"no inkling that these two individuals, or anyone else for that matter, was planning to do something along these lines.\" After the INS determined in August that the two men already had entered the United States, the FBI launched a search but couldn't find them before the Sept. 11 attack. FBI and American Airlines officials have refused to say if their names were given to the airline, but the Los Angeles Times reported last week that they weren't. Generally agencies regard the lists as sensitive intelligence and do not routinely distribute the information among airlines, officials say. Former U.S. Customs Commissioner Raymond Kelly, now working for the U.S. Transportation Department on ways to improve airline security, told the Los Angeles Times that there have been ongoing problems with \"coordination and communication among agencies. I'm not sure all appropriate agencies get the watch list and if it's kept up in a timely fashion.\" Other problems exist. The airline industry has no central reservations system for all airlines. There's no single database that could be used to plug in the names of suspected terrorists.

There's no single database that could be used to plug in the names of suspected terrorists. Instead, four private companies run reservations systems used by airlines and travel agents. The largest one, Sabre, handles 40 percent of the world's airline reservations. William Vincent, former FAA security director, told Newsday the watch lists are \"not a guarantee that they can keep these people off the planes.\" Another problem is that American spellings of Middle Eastern names often vary widely. If a federal agency's version of a name were plugged into a computer and the reservation was made in a different version of the same name, the red flag might not be raised. Vincent also said watch lists don't include photographs that might help prevent suspects from boarding. Bungles involving watch lists aren't new. Sheik Omar Abdel Rahman, a blind Muslim cleric with ties to Islamic radical groups, was already on a watch list in 1990 when the State Department mistakenly granted him a visa into the United States. One problem, officials said, was that various documents had four versions of his name. He is serving a life sentence for conspiring to blow up tunnels and other facilities in New York City, and some of his followers were convicted in the 1993 bombing of the World Trade Center. **Off the Screen** Until six minutes before the second airliner hit the World Trade Center, Flight 77 appeared to air traffic controllers in the FAA's Washington Air Route Traffic Center in Leesburg, Va., to be just another flight they were routinely tracking. When the Boeing 757 reached central West Virginia, it was routinely \"handed off\" by Leesburg to the next air traffic control center, outside Indianapolis. Flight 77 continued west, appearing on the radar screens with a data block identifying the airline, flight number, altitude and type of plane - information from the plane's transponders, which are signal transmitting devices. The plane inched across the screen, the radar updating every 12 seconds. Then Flight 77 began to turn slightly - and abruptly disappeared from the radar screens. Suddenly there was no transponder signal. Federal officials say the terrorists apparently shut down the transponders in all four hijacked airliners as they took control. The air traffic controllers didn't know it, but Flight 77 was making a U-turn and heading east. Normally, when an aircraft's transponder cuts off, the plane is still visible as what's called a \"primary target\" or \"skinpaint\" - a target the radar is picking up but can't identify.

Normally, when an aircraft's transponder cuts off, the plane is still visible as what's called a \"primary target\" or \"skinpaint\" - a target the radar is picking up but can't identify. The controllers in Indianapolis kept watching for Flight 77 to appear over Kentucky, Ohio or Indiana - but they weren't looking for it to reappear far to the east, over West Virginia where the plane had come from, sources said. Back in Leesburg, air traffic controllers knew at about 9:05 a.m. that they had a new eastbound plane on their radar, but they didn't know it was Flight 77. The aircraft had entered their airspace with no radio contact and no transponder identification. During the confusion, rumors circulated that Flight 77 might have exploded in midair. It wasn't until 9:24 a.m. that the FAA alerted the military that the plane was heading for Washington. FAA spokesman William Shumann said the agency would not comment on its actions during the Sept. 11 crisis. Sources said that in coming weeks, the FAA may release air traffic control tapes that could tell more about what the agency knew and how it responded. Another response-time question involves American Airlines Flight 11, the first plane to hit the World Trade Center. The New York Times reported that air controllers first knew at about 8:20 a.m. that there had been a probable hijacking of that plane. But the FAA didn't notify the military until 20 minutes later, according to a North American Aerospace Defense Command document. One aviation expert said a simple change in the way airliner transponders work could have helped significantly on Sept. 11. Every commercial aircraft has two transponders, one for backup if the first one fails. It's easy to turn the devices off - the cockpit ceiling and walls are lined with knobs that control circuit breakers for all the systems of the plane. The pilot must be able to turn off systems easily to prevent the spread of a fire. Ken Susko, a Long Island-based aviation consultant and former Navy flight engineer, said aircraft should be modified so that if the transponder is turned off in the cockpit, a signal is generated to the controllers. \"That should trigger a signal, and then you could have a keyword or phrase to ask if a hijacking is in progress,\" Susko said. \"They might have been able to prevent the attack if that safety feature was on it. It's no big engineering feat to do it.\" The transponder issue came up briefly at a congressional hearing last week. Transportation Secretary Norman Mineta told legislators that", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:010923newsday.txt:6:9289dbc50eb1", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 6805, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "010923newsday.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "010923newsday", "chunk_index": 7, "text": "is turned off in the cockpit, a signal is generated to the controllers. \"That should trigger a signal, and then you could have a keyword or phrase to ask if a hijacking is in progress,\" Susko said. \"They might have been able to prevent the attack if that safety feature was on it. It's no big engineering feat to do it.\" The transponder issue came up briefly at a congressional hearing last week. Transportation Secretary Norman Mineta told legislators that the FAA would be willing to examine the question, but the matter was not discussed in detail. During the confusing first hour of the Sept. 11 emergency, Mineta had to cope with the unprecedented decision of whether to shut down take-offs from the nation's airports to stop more planes that might have hijackers aboard from getting into the air. It was a decision with a big price tag. Airlines frequently complain about temporary shutdowns for weather or congestion, called \"ground stops,\" because if planes aren't flying, the airlines aren't making money. The nation's 10 largest airlines alone spend close to $250 million a day, and a majority of those costs continue even if the planes are grounded. The FAA responded by closing airports completely or stopping take-offs in a series of stages and did not ban all take-offs across the country until 9:26 a.m., 24 minutes after the second impact at the World Trade Center. Air traffic data for major airports examined by Newsday suggest that at least several hundred additional planes entered the nation's airspace during the crisis before the nationwide shutdown. The total would be higher when take-offs from smaller airports are considered. Shumann, the FAA spokesman, said he didn't know if there had been any discussion in the agency of whether the airspace should have been closed more quickly. \"If there have been such discussions, we would not be commenting on those discussions,\" he said. \"Decisions like that are part of the investigation into what happened ... how quickly did we, the government, respond.\" **The Vulnerable Capital** By the time employees inside the Pentagon realized they were the terrorists' next target, it was already over. The sound of Flight 77 slamming into the building - a deafening crash to those nearby, a dull thump elsewhere in the massive structure - was their first alert. There had been no warning broadcast inside the building that a plane might be approaching, and no orders given to evacuate, even though the FAA had notified air defense commanders that a hijacked airliner was heading toward Washington 13 minutes before it hit the Pentagon. Even the clear sign of a terrorist attack on U.S. soil - the second plane slamming into the World Trade Center 35 minutes before one hit the Pentagon - barely elevated the state of readiness inside the nation's military headquarters, leaving many of the building's 20,000 workers still", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:010923newsday.txt:7:bd80cbfeec6f", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 6806, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "010923newsday.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "010923newsday", "chunk_index": 8, "text": "be approaching, and no orders given to evacuate, even though the FAA had notified air defense commanders that a hijacked airliner was heading toward Washington 13 minutes before it hit the Pentagon.

Some told Newsday they heard the crash but didn't know the plane had hit the Pentagon until they saw it on TV. To many Americans, it probably seems inconceivable that an unauthorized aircraft could get that close to the nation's military command center on any day, let alone one when the nation was under attack. Yet U.S. continental air defenses, slashed dramatically since the Cold War ended and never designed to thwart an internal threat, were helpless to stop the attacks, leaving the nation's capital and its most populated city exposed. The nation's sharpest military thinkers simply had never planned for such a massive and well-coordinated assault, one defense official told Newsday. \"I don't think any of us envisioned an internal air threat by big aircraft,\" he said. \"I don't know of anybody that ever thought through that. We're probably all at fault in some way for not thinking through the scope of that.\" Despite Andrews Air Force Base's proximity to the capital, fighter jets don't \"sit alert\" there the way they do at Langley, ready to take to the air in 15 minutes. Until Sept. 11, one defense official said, they didn't have to - fighters at Langley would have plenty of time to intercept any enemy aircraft coming from outside the United States. On Sept. 11, the Langley jets still were 105 miles away when the Pentagon was struck. \"We normally sit alert looking out and what happened with this is the threat was from within, and we hadn't looked into our own country before,\" Maj. General Paul A. Weaver Jr., director of the Air National Guard, said shortly after the attacks. \"All of a sudden the threat was from within.\" Some relatives of Pentagon victims are angry not only a the terrorists but also the federal government. \"Why is it that a plane can get so close to us?\" asked Trisha McCants, whose mother is missing. \"I'm mad. Once they knew the plane was off course, they should have stopped it.\" Others accepted what happened as an unpredictable risk. \"It's not my job to second guess,\" said Army employee Floyd Rasmussen, whose wife, also a Pentagon worker, was killed. **At the height of the Cold War, U.S. warplanes used to stand ready at 90 to 100 sites across the nation, there to intercept a Soviet bomber coming down from", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:010923newsday.txt:8:bb9965805b72", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 6807, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "010923newsday.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "010923newsday", "chunk_index": 9, "text": "asked Trisha McCants, whose mother is missing. \"I'm mad.

Before the attack, the number of alert bases had dropped to just seven sites around the country, mostly ringing the coast in the South and West for drug interdiction and other purposes.** In 1993, Colin Powell, then chairman of the military's Joint Chiefs of Staff and now Secretary of State - recommended that the number of bases on alert be sharply reduced or eliminated. More recently, before the attacks, Air Force planners also had considered scaling back the number of alert bases to shift money toward new technologies. Since the attacks, fighter jets at 26 sites near heavily populated areas have been put on 15-minute alert. Inside the Pentagon before it was struck, the civilian police force that patrols the building elevated the \"force protection level\" just one notch, from \"normal\" to \"alpha,\" after the second World Trade Center tower was struck but did not order an evacuation. \"To call for a general evacuation, at that point, it would have been just guessing,\" said a Pentagon spokesman, Glenn Flood. \"We evacuate when we know something is a real threat to us.\" Flood and others now say an evacuation could have put more employees at risk by moving them outside the protective walls of the building. **Air Force Lt. Col. Vic Warzinski, another Pentagon spokesman, added: \"The Pentagon was simply not aware that this aircraft was coming our way, and I doubt prior to Tuesday's event, anyone would have expected anything like that here**. There was no foreshadowing, no particular warning that would have led anyone with any reasonable view of the world to think this was a threat we faced.\" Former U.S. Sen. Gary Hart, who co-chaired a homeland security commission that in 1999 predicted a massive terrorist attack on U.S. soil, scoffs at that explanation. \"The Pentagon's been ground zero for 50 years, ever since the Soviets got a missile, so it shouldn't have been a great surprise,\" said Hart, who believes military planners envisioned nothing more than \"a madman in a single-engine Cessna\" coming after the Pentagon, in much the way such a plane once landed on the White House lawn. \"A cold war ended 10 years ago but a new one began,\" Hart said. \"If you could drive a bomb into the Twin Towers", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:010923newsday.txt:9:df21c00a4bcb", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 6808, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "010923newsday.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "010923newsday", "chunk_index": 10, "text": "Pentagon's been ground zero for 50 years, ever since the Soviets got a missile, so it shouldn't have been a great surprise,\" said Hart, who believes military planners envisioned nothing more than \"a madman in a single-engine Cessna\" coming after the Pentagon, in much the way such a plane once landed on the White House lawn. \"A cold war ended 10 years ago but a new one began,\" Hart said. \"If you could drive a bomb into the Twin Towers in 1993, I would think someone at the Pentagon would have said, 'They could do something to us.'\" Staff writers Richard J.

He brought his landlord coffee and cookies. He remembered to use his frequent-flier number when he bought his ticket from Boston to Los Angeles-business class. And a good student, too, reported his flight instructor, though he seemed more interested in turning the plane than landing it. A little standoffish, maybe, but he could knock back a vodka with his buddies. So it was uncharacteristic for Mohamed Atta to be running a little behind when he boarded American Airlines Flight 11 on Tuesday shortly before 8 a.m. One of his bags never made it aboard, but maybe that was intentional, too, for inside was a suicide note. THE FBI BELIEVES that Atta was in control when Flight 11 crashed into the North Tower of the World Trade Center, but maybe not. The hijackers had an abundance of piloting talent-four of the five terrorists aboard had some flight training. Indeed, there were enough hijackers with piloting skills to fly four airliners-two for New York, and two for Washington. At the White House on that beautiful, clear morning, the occupants were running for their lives. Vice President Dick Cheney had already been hustled into a bunker designed to withstand the shock of a nuclear blast when, at about 9:30 a.m., Secret Service men told staffers leaving the West Wing to run, not walk, as far away as possible. \"There's a plane overhead, don't look back!\" shouted a policeman. Agents were yelling at women to shed their high-heeled shoes so they could run faster. Several staffers saw a civilian airliner, reflecting white in the bright sunlight, appearing to circle nearby. Perhaps unable to spot the White House, the hijackers at the control of American Airlines Flight 77 dive-bombed the Pentagon instead. How could a small band of religious zealots knock down the World Trade Center, the most visible symbol of capitalism, killing thousands in lower Manhattan, and come so close to destroying the executive mansion of the most powerful nation on earth? Part of the answer is that few U.S. government officials really believed they could.

Perhaps unable to spot the White House, the hijackers at the control of American Airlines Flight 77 dive-bombed the Pentagon instead. How could a small band of religious zealots knock down the World Trade Center, the most visible symbol of capitalism, killing thousands in lower Manhattan, and come so close to destroying the executive mansion of the most powerful nation on earth? Part of the answer is that few U.S. government officials really believed they could. Consider the dazed reaction of top officials of the Federal Aviation Administration, the agency charged with safely controlling the nation's airways. Although a couple of aircraft had been behaving erratically on the radar screens of flight controllers for at least 15 minutes, officials at FAA headquarters did not suspect that a hijacking had occurred until the second plane, United Airlines Flight 175, rammed the South Tower of the World Trade Center at 9:05. A half hour later, when the third plane, American Flight 77, hit the Pentagon, the FAA officials responded in classic bureaucratic fashion. \"Get out your security manuals,\" ordered one top official. The officials dutifully began reading their manuals to determine who among them were deemed \"essential\" and should stay and work, and who should go home for the day. U.S. Air Force fighter planes did not arrive to protect the nation's capital for another 15 minutes. Pentagon officials had watched helplessly as the suicide airliner bore in on the nation's military command center. In the chaotic aftermath, the plane at the greatest risk of getting shot down was the one flying the attorney general of the United States. At least that's the way it seemed to the pilot, David Clemmer, a Vietnam combat veteran who received a warning as he flew the nation's chief law-enforcement officer, John Ashcroft, back to Washington from an aborted speaking engagement in the Midwest. Land your plane immediately, Clemmer was instructed by an air-traffic controller, or risk getting shot down by the U.S. Air Force. Clemmer turned to an FBI agent assigned to guard Ashcroft and said, \"Well, Larry, we're in deep kimchi here, and basically, all the rules you and I know are out the window.\" The pilot notified air-traffic controllers that he was carrying the attorney general-but was worried that the message wouldn't get through to military commanders controlling the airspace around Washington. \"Thinking out of the box,\" as Clemmer put it, he asked for-and got-a fighter escort into Washington. His plane, guarded by an F-16, was one of the last to land on the East Coast that day. Within a day or two, the haplessness, the confusion, the mentality of \"it can't happen here\" had been wiped away, perhaps forever. An aircraft carrier patrolled off New York Harbor, past the skyline so horrifically sundered by the destruction of the World Trade Center. Washington was an armed camp on hair-trigger alert. \"We're at", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:010924newsweek.txt:1:69ccfae4b026", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 6813, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "010924newsweek.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "010924newsweek", "chunk_index": 2, "text": "asked for-and got-a fighter escort into Washington.

An aircraft carrier patrolled off New York Harbor, past the skyline so horrifically sundered by the destruction of the World Trade Center. Washington was an armed camp on hair-trigger alert. \"We're at war,\" declared President George W. Bush. \"We will not only deal with those who dare attack America, we will deal with those who harbor them and feed them and house them.\" The FBI had launched the largest manhunt in history, code-named PENTTBOM (for Pentagon and Twin Towers), tracking the suspected 19 suicide bombers and their backers around the nation and abroad. Intelligence officials told NEWSWEEK that they feared that between 30 and 50 teams of terrorists were still on the loose. It was hard to tell if the threat was real, or if America was gripped with the sort of frenzy that seized the nation after the Japanese bombed Pearl Harbor-and many citizens assumed that Japanese troops would soon be marching on Chicago. Northwest Airlines confirmed that flight attendants were staying away from work in droves. And bomb scares became routine. By Saturday, FBI agents had detained 25 people wanted for questioning on immigration violations and issued arrest warrants for two other \"material witnesses.\" Congress will no doubt hold hearings to assign the fault for a massive failure of intelligence. At the CIA, NEWSWEEK has learned, officials looked at the Justice Department's list of dead hijackers aboard American Flight 77, the plane that hit the Pentagon, and recognized three of them as terrorism suspects. (\"Oh s-t,\" exclaimed one official.) In late August, the agency had asked the FBI to find two of the men, one of whom was believed to be connected to a suspect in the October 2000 bombing of the destroyer the USS Cole. But the FBI was still looking when the hijackers struck. The blame game will go on. But the finger-pointing may miss a darker and more troubling truth about the shocking attack. It is very difficult for a free and open society to defend against terrorists who are at once patient, smart and willing to die. The operatives run by Al Qaeda, the terrorist organization that reports to bin Laden, appear to be all three. As the PENTTBOM investigation exposes the sophisticated and long-conceived suicide plot, a portrait of evil genius emerges. It is often said that Islamic extremists wish to turn back history. They want to destroy the Western modernity that threatens to eclipse their fantasy of an 11th-century theocracy.

But, like a judo expert who leverages his opponent's superior weight and mass against him, Islamic terrorists have found a diabolically clever way to flip the Great Satan on his back. Blending into American society for months and even years, quietly awaiting the signal to move, bin Laden's operatives have learned how to turn two of America's greatest strengths-openness and technology-into weapons against the American people. Armed with pocket knives, they transformed U.S. airliners into guided missiles, flying bombs packed with 60,000 gallons of explosive fuel. That feat, while awesome, could be just the beginning. Talking on cell phones and by encrypted e-mail, operatives in bin Laden's far-flung network can communicate from Afghanistan to Miami with little risk of immediate detection. It is chilling to think what they could accomplish if they get their hands on the acme of Western military science, the nuclear bomb. Without doubt, they are trying. \"The ability to take our expertise and turn it on us is exhilarating to them,\" says Sen. Ron Wyden, a member of the Senate intelligence committee. \"They stay at it and stay at it to learn how to defeat our technological systems. It's like rattling doors through the neighborhood, looking for one to break in. That's what they're doing with our technology.\" The lock to America's rickety, overburdened air-control system was especially easy to pick. But America's water and electrical supplies aren't much better safeguarded. And teenage computer hackers have already demonstrated how to use the wide-open Internet to wreck cyberhavoc on American businesses and homes. For all their professed devotion to medieval religiosity, the terrorists themselves appear to have comfortably blended into American culture. They do not appear to be poor, or desperate or down on their luck, like the stereotype of a young Arab man drawn to the false promise of entering Paradise through martyrdom. At least one of the 19 had a family, and all apparently lived comfortable middle-class lives, with enough money to rent cars, go to school and violate the Quran's ban on alcohol by visiting the occasional bar. A senior European intelligence official told NEWSWEEK that some of the hijackers may have had Swiss bank accounts, which have now been frozen by Swiss authorities. Two of the alleged hijackers aboard Flight 93, Ahmed Alhaznawi and Ziad Jarrahi, drove a Ford Ranger and lived in a quiet neighborhood in Lauderdale-by-the-Sea, Fla.

In front of the house was a wooden wind chime carrying the message THIS HOUSE IS FULL OF LOVE. NEWSWEEK has learned that the Pentagon has referred to the FBI reports that three of the hijackers may have received help from Uncle Sam-as trainees at Pensacola Naval Air Station in Florida; two others may have studied at Air Force facilities. Osama bin Laden, their spiritual leader and financier, comes from a privileged background himself. One of more than 50 children of Yemeni billionaire parents who got rich off construction contracts in Saudi Arabia, bin Laden, for a time, made money on those most Western of beverages, Coke and Pepsi. During the early '90s, while he lived in Sudan, he owned part of a company that produced gum arabic, an essential ingredient of many soft drinks. Bin Laden may not have a vast personal fortune, at least not the $300 million ascribed to him, but he is able to secure funds from nefarious sources. According to intelligence sources, his agents are involved in drug running and he receives \"blood money\" payment from frightened Arab regimes that want to buy protection from his zealotry. According to U.S. intelligence sources, bin Laden is able to pay pensions to the families of suicide bombers. Mohamed Atta was, according to investigators, the perfect soldier in bin Laden's army. He was a citizen of the world. Traveling on a passport from the United Arab Emirates, he lived in Germany for a time, studying at the Technical University in Hamburg. He frequented a nightspot named Sharky's Billiard Bar (\"the Bar With Mega-Possibilities\"), wore black jeans, and rented-but failed to return-a video of John Carpenter's \"Vampire.\" At the same time, he requested and received a prayer room at the university for himself and about 20 other Muslim students. In the last two years, he began to wear Muslim dress. Atta, 33, may have had a shadowy past. According to German authorities, he is suspected in the bombing of an Israeli bus in 1986, when he was only 18 or 19 years old. If true, he should have been denied immigration visas. Instead, he was able to move freely between Germany and the United States. He was clearly preparing for some sort of terrorist action for months. According to law-enforcement authorities, he may have begun casing Logan Airport in Boston more than six months ago. And, NEWSWEEK has learned, he was seen last winter in Norfolk, Va., where, the FBI believes, he may have been surveying the giant U.S. Navy base as a target. Already, say investigators,", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:010924newsweek.txt:4:a2dd50372d87", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 6816, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "010924newsweek.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "010924newsweek", "chunk_index": 5, "text": "have been denied immigration visas.

And, NEWSWEEK has learned, he was seen last winter in Norfolk, Va., where, the FBI believes, he may have been surveying the giant U.S. Navy base as a target. Already, say investigators, there are important links between the hijackers who attacked American targets last week and the plotters who tried to sink the USS Cole in Yemen last October. Atta had plenty of cash. He wrote a $10,000 check to take flight lessons at one of Florida's many flight schools. (Because of its year-round good weather and proximity to the beach, Florida attracts many international flight students, especially from the Middle East; background checks are said to be minimal.) Last December, he and another man paid $1,500 for six hours in a Boeing 727 simulator. \"Looking back at it, it was a little strange that all they wanted to do was turns,\" Henry George, who runs SimCenter, Inc., at Opa-Locka Airport, told The Miami Herald. \"Most people who come here want to do takeoffs and landings.\" At the time, Atta aroused no suspicion. When he turned in his rent-a-car in Pompano Beach, Fla., on Sept. 9, before heading north on his suicide mission, he reminded the dealer, Brad Warrick, that the car needed to be serviced. \"The only thing out of the ordinary,\" Warrick recalled, \"was that he was nice enough to let me know the car needed an oil change.\" Atta and several friends were regulars at a Venice bar called the 44th Aero Squadron, decorated in the motif of a bomber-squadron bunker, complete with sandbags. \"I never had any problems with them,\" said the owner, Ken Schortzmann. They didn't want to be bothered, but didn't drink heavily and flirt with the waitresses, like some of the other flight students. Atta seemed to be the leader. \"He had a fanny pack with a big roll of cash in it,\" said Schortzmann. Last week Atta and two of his buddies seem to have gone out for a farewell bender at a seafood bar called Shuckums. Atta drank five Stoli-and-fruit-juices, while one of the others drank rum and Coke. For once, Atta and his friends became agitated, shouting curse words in Arabic, reportedly including a particularly blasphemous one that roughly translates as \"F-k God.\" There was a squabble when the waitress tried to collect the $48 bill (her shift was ending and she wanted her tip). One of the Arabs became indignant. \"I work for American Airlines. I'm a pilot,\" he said. \"What makes you think I'd have a problem paying the bill?\" Although investigators now suspect that Atta may been the leader", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:010924newsweek.txt:5:d1c54a82fda3", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 6817, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "010924newsweek.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "010924newsweek", "chunk_index": 6, "text": "his friends became agitated, shouting curse words in Arabic, reportedly including a particularly blasphemous one that roughly translates as \"F-k God.\" There was a squabble when the waitress tried to collect the $48 bill (her shift was ending and she wanted her tip).

I'm a pilot,\" he said. \"What makes you think I'd have a problem paying the bill?\" Although investigators now suspect that Atta may been the leader of his cell, it is not clear if and when he was, in effect, \"triggered.\" The pattern of bin Laden's terrorism is to insert operatives into a country where they are \"sleepers,\" burrowed deep into the local culture, leading normal lives while awaiting orders. Intelligence sources believe that one or two control agents run by bin Laden's Qaeda may have slipped into the United States in the last couple of weeks to activate the airliner plot. The idea of using suicide pilots may have been germinating for a very long time. One of the other pilot-hijackers on Flight 11, Waleed Alshehri, attended flight school in Florida in 1997. Last week FBI Director Robert Mueller told a news conference, \"The fact that they received flight training in the U.S. is news.\" But maybe it shouldn't have been. Only last September an Orlando, Fla., cabdriver named Ihab Ali was indicted for refusing to answer questions about his ties to the bin Laden organization, including his \"pilot training in Oklahoma,\" according to court papers. Indeed, the records of the terrorism trial in New York for the August 1998 bombings of two U.S. embassies in Africa offer a wealth of information about bin Laden's use of U.S.-trained pilots. One of them, Essam Al-Ridi, who had been trained at a Texas flight school, was a key government witness, testifying that bin Laden's associates used him to try to buy a private jet to transport Stinger ground-to-air missiles from Pakistan to Sudan. It is not known exactly how many of bin Laden's operatives are still on the loose. One of the most intriguing suspects may be Amer Mohammed Kamfar, 41. Last winter or fall, he showed up in Florida and took flight lessons at FlightSafety Academy. He rented a house in Vero Beach, where he had a wife, who dressed in the traditional chador, and several children. Kamfar, who called himself \"John,\" \"shopped at Wal-Mart and ate a lot of pizza,\" according to a neighbor. Two weeks ago he packed up his family and left the area. Last week Florida cops put out an all-points bulletin, warning that Kamfar may be toting an AK-47. Two of the suicide bombers may have just slipped out of the federal government's grasp. According to intelligence sources, on Aug. 21 the CIA passed along information to the Immigration and Naturalization Service on a man who belonged on the watch list", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:010924newsweek.txt:6:26a421f92bd4", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 6818, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "010924newsweek.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "010924newsweek", "chunk_index": 7, "text": "ate a lot of pizza,\" according to a neighbor. Two weeks ago he packed up his family and left the area. Last week Florida cops put out an all-points bulletin, warning that Kamfar may be toting an AK-47. Two of the suicide bombers may have just slipped out of the federal government's grasp. According to intelligence sources, on Aug. 21 the CIA passed along information to the Immigration and Naturalization Service on a man who belonged on the watch list for terror suspects. The man, Khalid al-Midhar, had been videotaped in Kuala Lumpur talking to one of the suspected terrorists in the Cole bombing (the man is now in jail in Yemen). When the INS ran its database, it found that al-Midhar was already inside the United States. The CIA asked the FBI to find him and an associate, Salem Alhamzi. But the bureau didn't have much to go on. They listed their U.S. residence as \"the Marriott Hotel in New York.\" There are 10 Marriott-run hotels in New York. The bureau checked all of them and found nothing. Al-Midhar and Alhamzi were listed among the five hijackers of American Airlines Flight 77. Ever since the Customs Service foiled an apparent bomb plot on the eve of the millennium, U.S. intelligence has been very edgy about an attack on America. The man caught crossing between British Columbia and Seattle with explosives and timers in his car, Ahmed Ressam, later confessed that he planned to blow up Los Angeles International Airport. Ressam allegedly worked for a shadowy group of Algerian terrorists with ties to bin Laden. Twice a week, the \"Threat Committee,\" a group of top intelligence officials and diplomats, meets in the White House complex to review dozens of terrorist threats at home and abroad. In late June the CIA warned of possible terrorist action against U.S. targets, including those in the United States, for the Fourth of July. Nothing happened, but then in July the agency again warned about possible attacks overseas. The threat seemed grave enough to force U.S. ships in Middle Eastern ports to head for sea. Three weeks ago there was another warning that a terrorist strike might be imminent. But there was no mention of where. **On Sept. 10, NEWSWEEK has learned, a group of top Pentagon officials suddenly canceled travel plans for the next morning, apparently because of security concerns.****** But no one even dreamed that four airliners would be hijacked and plunged into targets in New York and Washington. Some officials complain that the intelligence community has been too focused on terrorists obtaining weapons of mass destruction-biological, chemical and nuclear-while overlooking low-tech threats-like the use of penknives and box cutters to hijack a plane. The Threat Committee has every reason to worry about bin Laden's trying to get hold of a nuke.

The Threat Committee has every reason to worry about bin Laden's trying to get hold of a nuke. During the New York trial of the men accused of bombing the embassies in Africa, one bin Laden associate testified that the boss had hatched a 1993 plan to spend $1.5 million to buy black-market uranium. He apparently failed-that time. Now the Bush administration and Congress seemed primed to do just about anything to foil future attacks. Justice Department lawyers have been told to take a fresh look at \"everything,\" one official said. Perhaps the most startling idea under examination would be a new presidential order authorizing secret military tribunals to try accused terrorists. The idea first occurred to former attorney general William Barr after the bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland, in 1988. Barr, at the time chief of the Justice Department's Office of Legal Counsel, got the idea after learning that his office was used during World War II to try-in secret-German saboteurs who were later hanged. The idea was rejected, but it's being revived on the theory that terrorists are de facto military \"combatants\" who don't deserve the full run of constitutional rights. Civil libertarians may balk, but never underestimate the desire for revenge. Consider some statistics: more people were killed by the suicide hijackers last week than the number of American soldiers killed in the entire American Revolution. Or at Antietam, the bloodiest one-day battle of the Civil War. Or at Pearl Harbor. Or on D-Day. And those were soldiers. War had become more and more remote and sterile to Americans who experienced combat as a phenomenon that occurred on TV, either in movies or occasionally by watching cruise missiles light up Baghdad on the evening news. Now those same American civilians are in a war. Not as spectators, but as targets. *With Michael Isikoff, Dan Klaidman, Martha Brant, Debra Rosenberg, Weston Kosova, Andy Murr, George Wehrfritz, Catharine Skipp and John Lantigua* FAIR USE NOTICE: This site contains copyrighted material the use of which has not always been specifically authorized by the copyright owner.

SANGER (NYT) 723 words WASHINGTON, Sept. 25 -- The president of Egypt and the deputy prime minister of Italy say that Osama bin Laden's network of Islamic terrorists threatened to kill President Bush and other leaders of the industrialized world when they met at a summit meeting in Genoa last July. The White House, in line with longstanding policy not to discuss threats on the president, declined to comment today. In an interview on French television on Monday, President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt spoke in specific terms about the threat, saying that ''on June 13 of this year, we learned of a communiqué from bin Laden saying he wanted to assassinate George W. Bush and other G8 heads of state during their summit in Italy.'' ''It was a well-known piece of information,'' Mr. Mubarak added in the interview broadcast by the network France 3. Separately, he told Le Figaro, a major French daily newspaper, that Egyptian intelligence services had told the United States about the threat and that the warning included a reference to ''an airplane stuffed with explosives.'' Several days before Mr. Mubarak's interview, in an appearance on Italian television, Gianfranco Fini, the Italian deputy prime minister, discussed parallels between the attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon, and warnings his government had received before the Genoa meeting in July. ''Many people joked about the Italian Intelligence Force,'' Mr. Fini said, ''but actually they had information that in Genoa there was the hypothesis of an attack on the American president with the use of an airplane. That is why we closed the airspace above Genoa and installed antiaircraft missiles. Those who joked should now reflect.'' The senior American security official said the source of warnings from foreign intelligence agencies was often unclear, and the volume was so great that serious threats were frequently difficult to separate from false alarms. A senior administration official, who", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:010926nytimes.txt:0:b2681cfdc92c", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 6822, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "010926nytimes.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "010926nytimes", "chunk_index": 1, "text": "had information that in Genoa there was the hypothesis of an attack on the American president with the use of an airplane.

The senior American security official said the source of warnings from foreign intelligence agencies was often unclear, and the volume was so great that serious threats were frequently difficult to separate from false alarms. A senior administration official, who could not confirm the accounts, said that foreign intelligence agencies frequently received tips about threats to the president that they passed on to Washington. While there was a general concern about Mr. bin Laden before the July conference in Italy, there had also been concerns about Islamic extremists at other summit meetings, including the Asian Pacific Economic Cooperation meeting in Brunei last year, attended by President Clinton. There was no attack in Genoa. It was marked chiefly by violent protests in the streets by anarchists and anticapitalist demonstrators that resulted in many injuries and the death of one protester at the hands of the Italian police. But participants and reporters who flew into the Christopher Columbus airport, which was closed to commercial traffic, were greeted by the unusual sight of antiaircraft batteries along the runways. One senior American official who has been involved in a number of such summit conferences said today, ''It's something I have never seen before, especially in such an obvious spot.'' Since the Sept. 11 attacks in New York and Washington, European and American officials have been reviewing threats from Mr. bin Laden's organization in June and July. Those threats resulted in a number of public warnings around the July 4 holiday, and extra security precautions for Mr. Bush. But after nothing materialized, the concern waned. The most specific warning that Mr. bin Laden planned an attack apparently came from Egyptian intelligence sources. In his interview with Le Figaro, published late last week, Mr. Mubarak said: ''We had communicated to the Americans certain information from the video made by bin Laden on the 13th of June. It spoke of assassinating President Bush and other heads of state in Rome. It was a question of an airplane stuffed with explosives. These precautions then had been taken.'' However, people who have viewed the tape say there is no reference on it to any airplane stuffed with explosives, no specific threat to kill the President, and no mention of an attack by aircraft. President Mubarak added that ''no one had imagined that Boeings filled with passengers would be crashed against the buildings.'' Italian officials say that the antiaircraft batteries they set up in Genoa were primarily intended to deter an attack from a small plane.

If the U.S. boosts defense spending in its quest to stop Osama bin Laden 's alleged terrorist activities, there may be one unexpected beneficiary: Mr. bin Laden 's family. Among its far-flung business interests, the well-heeled Saudi Arabian clan -- which says it is estranged from Osama -- is an investor in a fund established by Carlyle Group, a well-connected Washington merchant bank specializing in buyouts of defense and aerospace companies. Through this investment and its ties to Saudi royalty, the bin Laden family has become acquainted with some of the biggest names in the Republican Party. **In recent years, former President Bush , ex-Secretary of State James Baker and ex-Secretary of Defense Frank Carlucci have made the pilgrimage to the bin Laden family's headquarters in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. **Mr. Bush makes speeches on behalf of Carlyle Group and is senior adviser to its Asian Partners fund, while Mr. Baker is its senior counselor. Mr. Carlucci is the group's chairman. Osama is one of more than 50 children of Mohammed bin Laden , who built the family's $5 billion business, Saudi Binladin Group, largely with construction contracts from the Saudi government. Osama worked briefly in the business and is believed to have inherited as much as $50 million from his father in cash and stock, although he doesn't have access to the shares, a family spokesman says. Because his Saudi citizenship was revoked in 1994, Mr. bin Laden is ineligible to own assets in the kingdom, the spokesman added. The bin Laden family has long disavowed Osama, and has cooperated fully with several federal investigations into his activities. The family business, headed by Osama's half-brother Bakr, epitomizes the U.S.-Saudi alliance that the suspected terrorist often rails against. After the 1996 truck bombing in Dhahran, Saudi Arabia, that killed 19 U.S. servicemen, Saudi Binladin Group built military barracks and airfields for U.S. troops. But the Federal Bureau of Investigation has issued subpoenas to banks used by the bin Laden family seeking records of family dealings,", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:010927wallstreetjournal.txt:0:1efe196081cc", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 6825, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "010927wallstreetjournal.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "010927wallstreetjournal", "chunk_index": 1, "text": "long disavowed Osama, and has cooperated fully with several federal investigations into his activities.

After the 1996 truck bombing in Dhahran, Saudi Arabia, that killed 19 U.S. servicemen, Saudi Binladin Group built military barracks and airfields for U.S. troops. But the Federal Bureau of Investigation has issued subpoenas to banks used by the bin Laden family seeking records of family dealings, a person familiar with the matter said. This person said the subpoenas weren't an indication the FBI had found any suspicious behavior by the family. A family spokesman said he had no knowledge of the subpoenas but that the family welcomes them and has nothing to hide. People familiar with the family's finances say the bin Ladens do much of their banking with National Commercial Bank in Saudi Arabia and with the London branch of Deutsche Bank AG. They also use Citigroup Inc. and ABN Amro, the people said. \"If there were ever any company closely connected to the U.S. and its presence in Saudi Arabia, it's the Saudi Binladin Group,\" says Charles Freeman, president of the Middle East Policy Council, a Washington nonprofit concern that receives tens of thousands of dollars a year from the bin Laden family. \"They're the establishment that Osama's trying to overthrow.\" Mr. Freeman, who served as U.S. ambassador to Saudi Arabia during the Gulf War, says he has spoken to two of Osama's brothers since hijacked airplanes rammed the World Trade Center and the Pentagon on Sept. 11. They told him, he says, that the FBI has been \"remarkably sensitive, tactful and protective\" of the family during the current crisis, recognizing its longstanding friendship with the U.S. A Carlyle executive said the bin Laden family committed $2 million through a London investment arm in 1995 in Carlyle Partners II Fund, which raised $1.3 billion overall. The fund has purchased several aerospace companies among 29 deals. So far, the family has received $1.3 million back in completed investments and should ultimately realize a 40% annualized rate of return, the Carlyle executive said. But a foreign financier with ties to the bin Laden family says the family's overall investment with Carlyle is considerably larger. He called the $2 million merely an initial contribution. \"It's like plowing a field,\" this person said. \"You seed it once. You plow it, and then you reseed it again.\" The Carlyle executive added that he would think twice before accepting any future investments by the bin Ladens. \"The situation's changed now,\" he said. \"I don't want to spend my life talking to reporters.\" **A U.S. inquiry into bin Laden family business dealings could brush against some big names associated with the U.S. government.

Former President Bush said through his chief of staff, Jean Becker, that he recalled only one meeting with the bin Laden family, which took place in November 1998. Ms. Becker confirmed that there was a second meeting in January 2000, after being read the ex-president's subsequent thank-you note. \"President Bush does not have a relationship with the bin Laden family,\" says Ms. Becker. \"He's met them twice.\" ** **Mr. Baker visited the bin Laden family in both 1998 and 1999, according to people close to the family. In the second trip, he traveled on a family plane. **Mr. Baker declined comment, as did Mr. Carlucci, a past chairman of Nortel Networks Corp., which has partnered with Saudi Binladin Group on telecommunications ventures. **Former President Carter met with 10 of Osama's brothers early in 2000 on a fund-raising trip for the Carter Center in Atlanta.** According to John Hardman, executive director of the center, the brothers told Mr. Carter that Osama was completely removed from the family. After Mr. Carter and his wife followed up with breakfast with Bakr bin Laden in New York in September 2000, the bin Laden family gave $200,000 to the center. \"We don't have any reason to think there's a connection\" between Osama and the rest of the family, Mr. Hardman says. During the past several years, the family's close ties to the Saudi royal family prompted executives and staff from closely held New York publisher Forbes Inc. to make two trips to the family headquarters, according to Forbes Chairman Caspar Weinberger, a former U.S. secretary of defense in the Reagan administration. \"We would call on them to get their view of the country and what would be of interest to investors.\" Mr. Weinberger said no trips to Saudi Arabia were planned. \"If we went,\" he said, \"we may or may not call upon them. I don't think the sins of the son should be visited on the father or the brother and the cousins and the aunts.\" There is no indication President George W. Bush has met any of the bin Ladens, but he was indirectly linked to one of them two decades ago. His longtime friend James W. Bath, who met Mr. Bush when they were both pilots in the Air National Guard, acted as a Texas business representative for Osama's older brother, Salem bin Laden , from 1976 to 1988, when Salem died in a plane crash.

Mr. Bath brought real-estate acquisitions and other deals to Salem bin Laden , an ebullient man who headed the family construction business. Mr. Bath generally received a 5% interest as his fee, and was sometimes listed as a trustee in related corporate documents. Mr. Bath acknowledged that during the same period he invested $50,000 in two funds controlled by Mr. Bush but said that stake was unrelated to his dealings with Mr. bin Laden . Among the properties that Salem bin Laden bought on Mr. Bath's recommendation was the Houston Gulf Airport, a lightly used airfield in League City, Texas, 25 miles east of Houston. But Mr. bin Laden 's hope that it would develop a major overflow airport for Houston never materialized, in part due to concern over wetlands. Ever since his death, his estate has sought to sell the airfield -- without success. Today, it is still on the market.

Since the mid-1990s, while the spotlight shone on cocaine cartels in Latin America, Bin Laden fortified a drug-trafficking network that provided major revenues for Afghanistan's Taliban regime _ and financed his Al-Qaida network of terrorism. Bin Laden's commerce in narcotics helped make Afghanistan the world's leading exporter of heroin, some 2,200 pounds of which reached the United States last year, according to the U.S. State Department. Worth at least $260 million in street value, some of the proceeds from the American heroin sales found their way back to Bin Laden, who stands accused by President Bush of orchestrating the Sept. 11 suicide hijack attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon. \"What better way to poison the Western world than through drugs,\" said Donnie Marshall, who headed the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration from July 1999 through June of this year. \"It's another weapon in their arsenal.\" Yoseff Bodansky, author of a 1999 biography of Bin Laden and director of the congressional Task Force on Terrorism and Unconventional Warfare, said the terrorist kingpin takes a 15 percent cut of the drug trade money in exchange for protecting smugglers and laundering their profits. \"The Afghans are selling 7 to 8 billion dollars of drugs in the West a year,\" Bodansky said. \"Bin Laden oversees the export of drugs from Afghanistan. His people are involved in growing the crops, processing and shipping. When Americans buy drugs, they fund the jihad (holy war).\" Bin Laden is the son of a Saudi construction magnate, and estimates of his wealth vary widely. Some intelligence experts say his family cut him off after the Saudi government expelled him in 1992 for organizing violent protests of its alliance with the United States in the Gulf War. Many experts believe that Bin Laden oversees a large stream of income from a web of legitimate businesses, donations from wealthy Muslims throughout the Middle East, drug trafficking and ties to other organized crime. Rachel Ehrenfeld, who tracks international money laundering and drug trafficking as director of the New York-based Center for the Study of Corruption said Bin Laden recycles the drug proceeds through businesses in Europe and the Far East. \"The drug trade is a triple-pronged weapon for Bin Laden and the Taliban,\" she said. \"It finances their activities. It undermines the enemy. And it proves that the enemy is corrupt, which they then use in their own recruiting propaganda.\" Heroin is produced in labs through a chemical process from opium gum, a thick sap scraped from the scored flower bulbs of poppy plants.

And it proves that the enemy is corrupt, which they then use in their own recruiting propaganda.\" Heroin is produced in labs through a chemical process from opium gum, a thick sap scraped from the scored flower bulbs of poppy plants. Ten pounds of opium produces 1 pound of pure heroin, which is dried, pulverized into white powder, cut with corn starch and other substances, then sold on the street in varying degrees of purity. Afghanistan's Taliban rulers announced a ban on poppy plant cultivation 14 months ago. Before the Sept. 11 attacks, they complained that the ban had not succeeded in easing economic sanctions the United Nations imposed on Afghanistan in 1998 for harboring terrorists and drug traffickers. \"We have done what needed to be done, putting our people and our farmers through immense difficulties,\" Abdol Hamid Akhondzadeh, director of the Taliban's High Commission on Drug Control, said in May. \"We expected to be rewarded for our actions, but instead were punished with additional sanctions.\" But a five-person panel of United Nations experts concluded that 10 months after the ban, stored opium was being sold to buy arms, \"finance the training of terrorists and support the operation of terrorists in neighboring countries and beyond.\" The U.N. panel also noted that Afghanistan was still importing large quantities of acetic anhydride, the main chemical used in heroin production. Many Western experts suspect the Taliban of stockpiling opium gum and heroin, which unlike cocaine have long shelf lives and can be stored for years if securely packaged. \"They have reduced poppy cultivation over the last year or two, but I think that was largely a sham,\" said Marshall, the former DEA chief. \"There is a lot of evidence that they have stockpiled opium gum and that limiting cultivation is not going to have any impact because they have been preparing for several years to do that.\" Indeed, wholesale opium prices have plummeted in recent days, signaling to Marshall and other experts that the Taliban has started to dump its stockpiles before the possible outbreak of war in Afghanistan. The Taliban, a sect of Islamic extremists, gained control of Kabul and most of Afghanistan in 1996 after a four-year civil war. Soviet troops left Afghanistan in 1989 after a nearly decade-long occupation, and the Moscow-backed communist government fell in 1992. Among the world's poorest countries, Afghanistan has a mainly subsistence economy with little industry or large-scale commerce. The Taliban is still fighting an opposition coalition in northern Afghanistan. Robert Brown, deputy director of supply reduction in the White House Office of National Drug Control Policy, said the Taliban raises revenue by taxing opium cultivation and heroin", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:010930startribune.opiumdrugtrade.txt:1:f0a650cd6da5", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 6831, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "010930startribune.opiumdrugtrade.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "010930startribune.opiumdrugtrade", "chunk_index": 2, "text": "after a four-year civil war.

The Taliban is still fighting an opposition coalition in northern Afghanistan. Robert Brown, deputy director of supply reduction in the White House Office of National Drug Control Policy, said the Taliban raises revenue by taxing opium cultivation and heroin production. \"A substantial percentage of the Taliban's government proceeds comes from the opium trade,\" Brown said. \"There has been really no significant reduction in the outflow of drugs from Afghanistan despite the cultivation ban.\" Afghanistan and Burma were the only two countries the United States failed to certify in March in its annual assessment of foreign nations' cooperation in fighting illegal drugs. Congress passed a law in 1986 requiring two dozen countries to get annual anti-trafficking certification as a condition for getting U.S. aid. \"Traffickers of Afghan heroin continued to route most of their production to Europe, but also targeted the United States,\" the State Department said in its report. \"Those in positions of authority have made proclamations against poppy cultivation, but they have had little or no effect on the drug trade, which continues to expand.\" Afghan drug trafficking didn't begin with the rise of the Taliban or the arrival of Bin Laden five years ago. Mujahedin rebels who successfully repelled the Soviet invasion financed their war through opium sales. Alfred McCoy, a professor of Southeast Asian history at the University of Wisconsin, said U.S. and Pakistani intelligence officials sanctioned the rebels' drug trafficking because of their fierce opposition to the Soviets. Gulbuddin Hekmatyar, a rebel leader who received $1 billion in covert CIA funds, was a major heroin trafficker, according to McCoy. Afghan opium production ballooned from 250 tons in 1982 to 2,000 tons in 1991. \"The CIA's mission was to fight the Cold War, and for that they were willing to sacrifice the drug war,\" McCoy said. \"If their local allies were involved in narcotics trafficking, it didn't trouble CIA. They were willing to keep working with people who were heavily involved in narcotics.\" Charles Cogan, now a research associate at Harvard University's John F. Kennedy School of Government, directed the Afghan operation for the CIA in the 1980s. He said the agency did not know at the time that the anti-Soviet rebels were engaged in drug trafficking. \"We found out about it later on,\" he said. But in 1995, Cogan told an Australian television reporter: \"Our main mission was to do as much damage as possible to the Soviets. We didn't really have the resources or the time to devote to an investigation of the drug trade. I don't think that we need to apologize for this. Every situation has its fallout. . . .

A NEWSWEEK investigation into the missed clues and missteps* NEWSWEEK Oct. 1 issue - He was more than a little suspicious. At the Airman Flight School in Norman, Okla., the stocky aspiring pilot with the heavy French accent acted oddly. He was abrupt and argumentative, refusing to pay the whole $4,995 fee upfront (he shelled out $2,500 in cash instead). He had been dodgy in his e-mails. E is not secure, explained Zacarias Moussaoui, 33, who preferred to use his Internet alias, zuluman tangotango. A poor flier, he suddenly quit in mid-May, before showing up at another flight school in Eagan, Minn. At Pam Am Flying Academy, he acknowledged that the biggest plane hed ever flown was a single-engine Cessna. But he asked to be trained on a 747 flight simulator. He wanted to concentrate only on the midair turns, not the takeoffs and landings. It was all too fishy to one of the instructors, who tipped off the Feds. Incarcerated because his visa had expired, Moussaoui was sitting in the Sherburne County Jail when some other pilot trainees drove their hijacked airliners into the World Trade Center and the Pentagon. Its not that the U.S. government was asleep. Americas open borders make tracking terrorists a daunting exercise. NEWSWEEK has learned that the FBI has privately estimated that more than 1,000 individualsmost of them foreign nationalswith suspected terrorist ties are currently living in the United States. The American people would be surprised to learn how many of these people there are, says a top U.S. official. Moussaoui almost exactly fits the profile of the suicide hijackers, but he may or may not have been part of the plot. After Moussaouis arrest on Aug. 17, U.S. immigration authorities dutifully notified the French (he was a passport holder), who responded 10 days later that Moussaoui was a suspected terrorist who had allegedly traveled to Osama bin Ladens training camps in Afghanistan. Ten days may seem like a leisurely pace for investigators racing against time to foil terrorist plots, but in the real world of international cooperation, 10 days cest rapide, a French official told NEWSWEEK. Fast but, in the new age of terror, not fast enough. As officials at the CIA and FBI sift through intelligence reports, they are berating themselves for missing warning signs on the road", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:011001newsweek.txt:0:f9de7795a705", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 6834, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "011001newsweek.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "011001newsweek", "chunk_index": 1, "text": "terrorist who had allegedly traveled to Osama bin Ladens training camps in Afghanistan. Ten days may seem like a leisurely pace for investigators racing against time to foil terrorist plots, but in the real world of international cooperation, 10 days cest rapide, a French official told NEWSWEEK. Fast but, in the new age of terror, not fast enough. As officials at the CIA and FBI sift through intelligence reports, they are berating themselves for missing warning signs on the road to Sept. 11. Those reports include intercepted messages with phrases like \"There is a big thing coming,\" \"They're going to pay the price\" and \"We're ready to go.\" Unfortunately, many of those messages, intercepted before the attack, did not reach the desks of intelligence analysts until afterward. In the bureaucracy of spying, 24-hour or 48-hour time lags are not unusual. None of the intercepted traffic mentioned the Pentagon or the World Trade Center. Some hinted at a target somewhere on the Pacific Rim. Nonetheless, an intelligence official told NEWSWEEK: \"A lot of people feel guilty and think of what they could have done.\" CROP-DUSTER MANUALS All across the world last week, intelligence services were scrambling to catch the terrorists before they struck again. The scale of the roundup was breathtaking: in Yemen, a viper's nest of terror, authorities hauled in \"dozens\" of suspected bin Laden followers. In Germany, police were searching for a pair of men believed to be directly involved in the hijacking plot. In France, more than half a dozen were being held for questioning, while in Britain, Belgium and the Netherlands-and Peru and Paraguay-police raided suspected terror hideouts. In the United States, where the FBI has launched the greatest manhunt in history, authorities detained about 90 people. Most of them were being held for minor immigration charges, but investigators were looking for mass murderers. The gumshoes swept up pieces of chilling evidence, like two box cutters stuffed into the seat of a Sept. 11 flight out of Boston-another hijacking target? Boston was jittery over threats of an attack last Saturday. An Arab in a bar was overheard to say that blood would flow in Boston on Sept. 22, and U.S. intelligence intercepted a conversation between Algerian diplomats talking about \"the upcoming Boston tea party on Sept. 22.\" It turned out that some women really were holding a tea party that day. Some federal officials were spooked when manuals describing crop-duster equipment-to spray deadly germs?-were found among Moussaoui's possessions. But a top U.S. official told NEWSWEEK, \"I'm not getting into the bunker and putting on a gas mask. We're used to seeing these threats.\" (Nonetheless, crop-dusters were barred from flying near cities.) The vast dragnet was heartening, unless one considers that after two American embassies were bombed in 1998, a similar crackdown swept up a hundred potential suspects from Europe to the Middle East to Latin America-and bin", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:011001newsweek.txt:1:089e3b8f55e8", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 6835, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "011001newsweek.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "011001newsweek", "chunk_index": 2, "text": "manuals describing crop-duster equipment-to spray deadly germs?-were found among Moussaoui's possessions.

The vast dragnet was heartening, unless one considers that after two American embassies were bombed in 1998, a similar crackdown swept up a hundred potential suspects from Europe to the Middle East to Latin America-and bin Laden's men were still able to regroup to launch far more devastating attacks. Catching foot soldiers and lieutenants will not be enough to stop even greater cataclysms. Last week the authorities were searching for a single man who might have triggered the assault on Washington and New York. In past attacks by bin Laden's Qaeda organization, \"sleeper\" agents have burrowed into the target country to await their orders. FBI officials now believe that the mastermind was Mohamed Atta, the intense Egyptian who apparently piloted the first plane, American Airlines Flight 11, into the North Tower of the World Trade Center. (\"Did he ever learn to fly?\" Atta's father, Mohamed al-Amir Atta, said to NEWSWEEK. \"Never. He never even had a kite. My daughter, who is a doctor, used to get him medicine before every journey, to make him combat the cramps and vomiting he feels every time he gets on a plane.\") Though intelligence officials believe they have spotted the operation's paymaster, identified to NEWSWEEK as Mustafa Ahmed, in the United Arab Emirates, Atta was the one hijacker who appeared to have the most contacts with conspirators on other aircraft prior to the attacks, and he was the one who left a last testament. According to a top government source, it included this prayer: \"Be prepared to meet your God. Be ready for this moment.\" Atta's role \"doesn't fit the usual pattern,\" said one official. \"It looks like the ringleader went down with the plane.\" The ultimate ringleader may be somewhere in the mountains of Afghanistan, hiding from U.S. bombs and commandos-but also no doubt plotting his next atrocity. In history's long list of villains, bin Laden will find a special place. He has no throne, no armies, not even any real territory, aside from the rocky wastes of Afghanistan. But he has the power to make men willingly go to their deaths for the sole purpose of indiscriminately killing Americans-men, women and children. He is an unusual combination in the annals of hate, at once mystical and fanatical-and deliberate and efficient. Now he has stirred America's wrath and may soon see America's vengeance. But the slow business of mopping up the poison spread by bin Laden through the Islamic world was almost pitifully underscored after the attack by a plea from FBI Director Robert Mueller. The nation's top G-man said the FBI was looking for more Arabic speakers.

The nation's top G-man said the FBI was looking for more Arabic speakers. A reasonable request, but perhaps a little late in the game. It's hard to know your enemy when you can't even speak his language. For most Americans, life was instantly and forever changed on Sept. 11, 2001. But the terror war that led up to the attack had been simmering, and sometimes boiling over, for more than 10 years. It can be recalled as a tedious bureaucratic struggle-all those reports on \"Homeland Defense\" piling up unread on the shelves of congressmen, droning government officials trying to fatten their budgets with scare stories relegated to the back pages of the newspaper. Or it can be relived-as it truly was-as a race to the Gates of Hell. Before the world finds out what horrors lie beyond, it's worthwhile retracing a decadelong trail of terror to see how America stumbled. The enemy has clearly learned from experience. In December 1994, the Armed Islamic Group (GIA), an Algerian-based terrorist band that would go on to play a prominent role in bin Laden's global army, hijacked an Air France Airbus with 171 passengers aboard. The plan: to plunge into the Eiffel Tower. The problem: none of the hijackers could fly. The Air France pilot landed instead in Marseilles, where French police stormed the plane. It was not too long afterward that the first terrorists began quietly enrolling in flight schools in Florida. THE BIN LADEN ROOM The United States has been a little slower on the uptake. Money has not really been the obstacle. The counterterrorism budget jumped from $2 billion to $12 billion over a decade. The United States spends $30 billion a year gathering intelligence. Nor has bin Laden been in any way ignored.** For the past five years, analysts have been working through the night in a chamber, deep in the bowels of CIA headquarters, known as the Bin Laden Room. **Some experts argued that the CIA was too focused on bin Laden-that, in an effort to put a face on faceless terror, the gaunt guerrilla fighter had been elevated to the role of international bogeyman, to the neglect of shadowy others who did the real killing. Now, as the Washington blame game escalates-along with the cries for revenge-intelligence officials are cautioning that terror cells, clannish and secretive, are extremely difficult to penetrate; that for every snake beheaded two more will crawl out of the swamp; that swamps can never be drained in", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:011001newsweek.txt:3:6283dc21ba0c", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 6837, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "011001newsweek.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "011001newsweek", "chunk_index": 4, "text": "in an effort to put a face on faceless terror, the gaunt guerrilla fighter had been elevated to the role of international bogeyman, to the neglect of shadowy others who did the real killing.

All true. But the inability of the government to even guess that 19 suicidal terrorists might turn four jetliners into guided missiles aimed at national icons was more than a failure of intelligence. It was a failure of imagination. The United States is so strong, the American people seemed so secure, that the concept of Homeland Defense seemed abstract, almost foreign, the sort of thing tiny island nations worried about. Terrorists were regarded by most people as criminals, wicked and frightening, but not as mortal enemies of the state. There was a kind of collective denial, an unwillingness to see how monstrous the threat of Islamic extremism could be. In part, that may be because the government of the United States helped create it. **In the 1980s, the CIA secretly backed the mujahedin, the Islamic freedom fighters rebelling against the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan. Arming and training the \"Mooj\" was one of the most successful covert actions ever mounted by the CIA.** It turned the tide against the Soviet invaders. But there is a word used by old CIA hands to describe covert actions that backfire: \"blowback.\" In the coming weeks, if and when American Special Forces helicopters try to land in the mountains of Afghanistan to flush out bin Laden, they risk being shot down by Stinger surface-to-air missiles provided to the Afghan rebels by the CIA. Such an awful case of blowback would be a mere coda to a long and twisted tragedy of unanticipated consequences. The tale begins more than 10 years ago, when the veterans of the Mooj's holy war against the Soviets began arriving in the United States-many with passports arranged by the CIA. Bonded by combat, full of religious zeal, the diaspora of young Arab men willing to die for Allah congregated at the Al-Kifah Refugee Center in Brooklyn, N.Y., a dreary inner-city building that doubled as a recruiting post for the CIA seeking to steer fresh troops to the mujahedin. The dominant figures at the center in the late '80s were a gloomy New York City engineer named El Sayyid Nosair, who took Prozac for his blues, and his sidekick, Mahmud Abouhalima, who had been a human minesweeper in the Afghan war (his only tool was a thin reed,", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:011001newsweek.txt:4:e1dbf80390dc", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 6838, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "011001newsweek.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "011001newsweek", "chunk_index": 5, "text": "Allah congregated at the Al-Kifah Refugee Center in Brooklyn, N.Y., a dreary inner-city building that doubled as a recruiting post for the CIA seeking to steer fresh troops to the mujahedin.

The new immigrants were filled not with gratitude toward their new nation, but by implacable hatred toward America, symbol of Western modernity that threatened to engulf Muslim fundamentalism in a tide of blue jeans and Hollywood videos. **Half a world away, people who understood the ferocity of Islamic extremism could see the coming storm. In the late '80s, Pakistan's then head of state, Benazir Bhutto, told the first President George Bush, \"You are creating a Frankenstein.\"** But the warnings never quite filtered down to the cops and G-men on the streets of New York. The international jihad arrived in America on the rainy night of Nov. 5, 1990, when Nosair walked into a crowded ballroom at the New York Marriott on 49th Street and shot and killed Rabbi Meir Kahane, a mindless hater who wanted to rid Israel of \"Arab dogs\" (\"Every Jew a .22\" was a Kahane slogan). The escape plan was amateur hour: Nosair's buddy Abouhalima was supposed to drive the getaway car, a taxicab, but the overexcited Nosair jumped in the wrong cab and was apprehended With a room full of witnesses and a smoking gun, the case against Nosair should have been a lay-down. But the New York police bungled the evidence, and Nosair got off with a gun rap. At that moment, Nosair and Abouhalima may have had an epiphany: back home in Egypt, suspected terrorists are dragged in and tortured. In America, they can hire a good lawyer and beat the system. The New York City police hardly noticed any grander scheme. A search of Nosair's apartment turned up instructions for building bombs and photos of targets-including the Empire State Building and the World Trade Center. The police never bothered to inventory most of the evidence, nor were the documents translated-that is, until a van with a 1,500-pound bomb blew up in the underground garage of the World Trade Center on Feb. 26, 1993. The (first) World Trade Center bombing, which killed six people and injured more than 1,000, might have been a powerful warning, especially when investigators discovered that the plotters had meant to topple the towers and packed the truck bomb with cyanide (in an effort to create a crude chemical weapon). But the cyanide was harmlessly burned up in the blast, the buildings didn't fall and the bombers seemed to be hapless.

But the cyanide was harmlessly burned up in the blast, the buildings didn't fall and the bombers seemed to be hapless. One of them went back to get his security deposit from the truck rental. The plotters were quickly exposed as disciples of Sheik Omar Abdel-Rahman, the \"Blind Sheik\" who ranted against the infidels from a run-down mosque in Jersey City. The Blind Sheik's shady past should have been of great interest to the Feds-he had been linked to the plot to assassinate Egyptian President Anwar Sadat in 1981. But the sheik had slipped into the United States with the protection of the CIA, which saw the revered cleric as a valuable recruiting agent for the Mooj. Investigators trying to track down the Blind Sheik \"had zero cooperation from the intelligence community, zero,\" recalled a federal investigator in New York. DEVIL'S DUO One World Trade Center plotter who did attract attention from the Feds was Ramzi Yousef. Operating under a dozen aliases, Yousef was a frightening new figure, seemingly stateless and sinister, a global avenging angel. Though he talked to Iraqi intelligence and stayed in a safe house that was later linked to bin Laden, Yousef at the time appeared to be a kind of terror freelancer. Yousef's luck ran out when the apartment of an old childhood friend, Abdul Hakim Murad, burst into flames. Plotting with Yousef, Murad had been at work making bombs to assassinate the pope and blow up no fewer than 11 U.S. airliners. Murad's arrest in January 1995 led investigators to capture Yousef in Pakistan, where he was hiding out. Murad and Yousef were a duo sent by the Devil: Murad had taken pilot lessons, and the two talked about flying a plane filled with explosives into the CIA headquarters or a nuclear facility. At the time, FBI officials thought the plans were grandiose and farfetched. Now they look like blueprints. The capture of Yousef was regarded as a stirring victory in the war against terrorism, which was just then gearing up in Washington. But Yousef's arrest illustrates the difficulties of cracking terrorism even when a prize suspect is caught. At his sentencing, Yousef declared, \"Yes, I am a terrorist, and I am proud of it.\" He has never cooperated with authorities. Instead, he spent his days chatting about movies with his fellow inmates in a federal maximum-security prison, Unabomber Ted Kaczynski and, until he was executed, the Oklahoma City bomber Timothy McVeigh.

By the mid-'90s, counterterror experts at the FBI and CIA had begun to focus on Osama bin Laden, the son of a Saudi billionaire who had joined the Mooj in Afghanistan and become a hero as a battlefield commander. Bin Laden was said to be bitter because the Saudi royal family had rebuffed his offer to rally freedom fighters to protect the kingdom against the threat of Saddam Hussein after the Iraqi strongman invaded Kuwait in 1990. Instead, the Saudi rulers chose to be defended by the armed forces of the United States. To bin Laden, corrupt princes were welcoming infidels to desecrate holy ground. Bin Laden devoted himself to expelling America, not just from Saudi Arabia, but-as his messianic madness grew-from Islam, indeed all the world. Tony Lake, President Bill Clinton's national-security adviser, does not recall one single defining moment when bin Laden became Public Enemy No. 1. It was increasingly clear to intelligence analysts that extremists all over the Middle East viewed bin Laden as a modern-day Saladin, the Islamic warrior who drove out the Crusaders a millennium ago. Setting up a sort of Terror Central of spiritual, financial and logistical support-Al Qaeda (the Base)-bin Laden went public, in 1996 telling every Muslim that their duty was to kill Americans (at first the fatwa was limited to U.S. soldiers, then broadened in 1998 to all Americans). From his home in Sudan, bin Laden seemed to be inspiring and helping to fund a broad if shadowy network of terrorist cells. On the rationale that no nation should be allowed to harbor terrorists, the State Department in the mid-'90s pressured the government of Sudan to kick out bin Laden. In retrospect, that may have been a mistake. At least in Sudan, it was easier to keep an eye on bin Laden's activities. Instead, he vanished into the mountains of Afghanistan, where he would be welcomed by extremist Taliban rulers and enabled to set up training bases for terrorists. These camps-crude collections of mud huts-appear to have provided a sort of Iron John bonding experience for thousands of aspiring martyrs who came for a course of brainwashing and bombmaking. With the cold war over, the Mafia in retreat and the drug war unwinnable, the CIA and FBI were eager to have a new foe to fight.

The two agencies established a Counter Terrorism Center in a bland, windowless warren of offices on the ground floor of CIA headquarters at Langley, Va. Historical rivals, the spies and G-men were finally learning to work together. But they didn't necessarily share secrets with the alphabet soup of other enforcement and intelligence agencies, like Customs and the Immigration and Naturalization Service, and they remained aloof from the Pentagon. And no amount of good will or money could bridge a fundamental divide between intelligence and law enforcement. Spies prefer to watch and wait; cops want to get their man. At the White House, a bright national-security staffer, Richard Clarke, tried to play counterterror coordinator, but he was given about as much real clout as the toothless \"czars\" sent out to fight the war on drugs. There was no central figure high in the administration to knock heads, demand performance and make sure everyone was on the same page. Lake now regrets that he did not try harder to create one. At the time, Clinton's national-security adviser was too preoccupied with U.S. involvement in Bosnia to do battle with fiefdoms in the intelligence community. \"Bosnia was easier than changing the bureaucracy,\" Lake told NEWSWEEK. TRUCK BOMBS An empire builder with a messianic streak of his own, FBI Director Louis Freeh was eager to throw G-men at the terrorist threat all over the world. When a truck bomb blew up the Khobar Towers, a U.S. military barracks in Saudi Arabia, Freeh made a personal quest of bringing the bombers to justice. As Freeh left office last summer, a grand jury in New York was about to indict several conspirators behind the bombing. But, safely secluded in Iran, the suspects will probably never stand trial. The Khobar Towers investigation shows the limits of treating terrorism as a crime. It also reveals some of the difficulties of working with foreign intelligence services that don't share the same values (or rules) as Americans. Freeh's gumshoes got a feel for Saudi justice when they asked to interview some suspects seized in an earlier bombing attack against a U.S.-run military compound in Riyadh. Before the FBI could ask any questions, the suspects were beheaded. An attempt by the FBI to play the role of Good Cop to the Saudis' Bad Cop was thwarted by American sensitivities. After the bombing, FBI agents managed to corner Hani al-Sayegh, a key suspect in Canada. Cooperate with us, the gumshoes threatened, or we'll send you back to Saudi Arabia, where a sword awaits.

No fool, the suspect hired an American lawyer. The State Department was convinced that sending the man back to Saudi Arabia would violate international laws banning torture. Their leverage gone, the Feds were unable to make the suspect talk. The CIA did have some luck in working with foreign security services to roll up terror networks. In 1997 and 1998, the agency collaborated with the Egyptians-whose security service is particularly ruthless-to root out cells of bin Laden's men from their hiding places in Albania. But just as the spooks were congratulating themselves, another bin Laden cell struck in a carefully coordinated, long-planned attack. **Within minutes of each other, truck bombs blew up the U.S. embassies in Tanzania and Kenya, killing more than 220.** The failure of intelligence in the August 1998 embassy bombings is a case study in the difficulty of penetrating bin Laden's network. **For some of the time that bin Laden's men were plotting to blow up the two embassies, U.S. intelligence was tapping their phones.** According to Justice Department documents, the spooks tapped five telephone numbers used by bin Laden's men living in Kenya in 1996 and '97. But the plotters did not give themselves away. Bin Laden uses couriers to communicate with his agents face to face. His Qaeda organization is also technologically sophisticated, sometimes embedding coded messages in innocuous-seeming Web sites. Intelligence experts have worried for some time that the supersecret-code breakers at the National Security Agency are going deaf, overwhelmed by the sheer volume of telecommunications and encryption software that any consumer can buy at a computer store. If high-tech espionage won't do the job, say the experts, then the CIA needs more human spies. It has become rote to say that in order to crack secretive terrorist cells the CIA needs to hire more Arabic-speaking case officers who can in turn recruit deep-penetration agents-HUMINT (human intelligence) in spy jargon. Actually, the CIA had a sometime informer among the embassy bombers. Ali Mohamed was a former Egyptian Army officer who enlisted in the U.S. Army and was sent to Fort Bragg, N.C., in the early 1980s to lecture U.S. Special Forces on Islamic terrorism. In his free time, he was a double agent.

Ali Mohamed went to Afghanistan to fight with the Mooj, but after the 1993 World Trade Center bombing, he flipped back, telling the Feds about bin Laden's connection to some of the bombers. He described how the Islamic terrorist used \"sleepers\" who live normal lives for years and then are activated for operations. What he did not tell the spooks was that he was helping plan to bomb the U.S. embassies in Africa. Only after he had pleaded guilty to conspiracy in 1999 did he disclose that he had personally met with bin Laden about the plot. He described how bin Laden, looking at a photo of the U.S. Embassy in Nairobi, \"pointed to where the truck could go as a suicide bomber.\" The story of Ali Mohamed suggests that the calls by some politicians for more and better informants may be easier to preach than practice. The CIA's skills in the dark arts of running agents have atrophied over the years. The agency was purged of some of its best spy handlers after the 1975 Church Committee investigation exposed some harebrained agency plots, like hiring the Mafia to poison Fidel Castro. During the Reagan years, the agency was beefed up, but a series of scandals in the late '80s and the '90s once more sapped its esprit. America's spies were once proud to engage in \"morally hazardous duty,\" said Carleton Swift, the CIA's Baghdad station chief in the late 1950s. \"Now the CIA has become a standard government bureaucracy instead of a bunch of special guys.\" A number of lawmakers are calling to, in effect, unleash the CIA. They want to do away with rules that restrict the agency from hiring agents and informers with a record of crimes or abusing human rights. Actually, case officers in the field can still hire sleazy or dangerous characters by asking permission from their bosses in Langley. \"We almost never turn them down,\" said one high-ranking official. But that answer may gloss over a more significant point-that case officers, made cautious by scandal, no longer dare to launch operations that could get them hauled before a congressional inquisition.

DIRTY TRICKS The weaknesses of the CIA's Directorate of Operations, once called \"the Department of Dirty Tricks,\" can be overstated. When the CIA suspected that the Sudanese government was helping bin Laden obtain chemical weapons, a CIA agent was able to obtain soil samples outside the Al Shifa pharmaceutical plant that showed traces of EMPTA-a precursor chemical used in deadly VX gas. The evidence was used to justify a cruise-missile attack on the factory in retaliation for the embassy bombings. At the same time, 70 cruise missiles rained down on a bin Laden training camp in Afghanistan. The Clinton administration was later mocked for this showy but meaningless response. Clinton's credibility was not high: he was accused of trying to divert attention from the Monica Lewinsky scandal. In classic American fashion, the owner of the pharmaceutical plant in Sudan hired a top Washington lobbying firm to heap scorn on the notion that his plant was being used for chemical weapons. But Clinton's national-security adviser at the time, Sandy Berger, still \"swears by\" the evidence, and insists that the cruise missiles aimed at bin Laden's training camps missed bin Laden and his top advisers by only a few hours. The Clinton administration never stopped trying to kill bin Laden. Although a 1976 executive order bans assassinations of foreign leaders, there is no prohibition on killing terrorists-or, for that matter, from killing a head of state in time of war. In 1998, President Clinton signed a \"lethal finding,\" in effect holding the CIA harmless if bin Laden was killed in a covert operation. The agency tried for at least two years to hunt down bin Laden, working with Afghan rebels opposed to the Taliban regime. These rebels once fired a bazooka at bin Laden's convoy but hit the wrong vehicle. \"There were a few points when the pulse quickened, when we thought we were close,\" recalled Berger. By the final year of the Clinton administration, top officials were very worried about the terrorist threat. Berger says he lay awake at night, wondering if his phone would ring with news of another attack. Administration officials were routinely trooping up to Capitol Hill to sound warnings. CIA Director George Tenet raised the specter of bin Laden so many times that some lawmakers suspected he was just trying to scare them into coughing up more money for intelligence. The Clinton Cassandras emphasized the growing risk that terrorists would obtain weapons of mass destruction-chemical, biological or nuclear. But the threat was not deemed to be imminent. Bin Laden was generally believed to be aiming at \"soft\" targets in the Middle East and Europe, like another embassy. The experts said that a few bin Laden", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:011001newsweek.txt:11:0cd4bca69d6f", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 6845, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "011001newsweek.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "011001newsweek", "chunk_index": 12, "text": "specter of bin Laden so many times that some lawmakers suspected he was just trying to scare them into coughing up more money for intelligence.

Bin Laden was generally believed to be aiming at \"soft\" targets in the Middle East and Europe, like another embassy. The experts said that a few bin Laden lieutenants were probably operating in the United States, but no one seriously expected a major attack, at least right away. The millennium plots should have been a wakeup call. Shortly before the 2000 New Year, an obscure Algerian refugee named Ahmed Ressam was caught by a wary U.S. Customs inspector trying to slip into the United States from Canada with the makings of a bomb. Ressam was a storm trooper in what may have been a much bigger plot to attack the Los Angeles airport and possibly other targets with a high symbolic value. A petty criminal who lived by credit-card fraud and stealing laptop computers, Ressam was part of a dangerous terrorist organization-GIA, the same group that hijacked the Air France jet in 1994 and tried, but failed, to plunge it into the Eiffel Tower. A particularly vicious group that staged a series of rush-hour subway bombings in Paris in the mid-'90s, GIA is a planet in Al Qaeda's solar system. Ressam later told investigators that he had just returned from one of bin Laden's Afghan training camps, where he learned such skills as feeding poison gas through the air vents of office buildings. Some of Ressam's confederates in the millennium plots were never picked up and are still at large. The Canadian Security Intelligence Service is believed to have fat files on the GIA, but like many secret services, the CSIS does not share its secrets readily with other services, at home or abroad. Some U.S. investigators believe that bin Laden was using Canada as a safe base for assaults on the United States. U.S. border authorities now believe that several of the suicide hijackers came across the border via a ferry from Nova Scotia in the days before the attack on the World Trade Center. In hindsight, the Ressam case offered clues to another bin Laden trademark: the ability of Al Qaeda-trained operatives to hide their tracks. While renting buildings in Vancouver, Ressam and his confederates frequently changed the names on the leases, apparently to lay a confusing paper trail. A kind of terrorist's how-to manual (\"Military Studies in the Jihad Against the Tyrants\") found at the home of a bin Laden associate in England last year instructs operatives to deflect suspicion by shaving beards, avoiding mosques and refraining from traditional Islamic greetings.

Intelligence officials now suspect that bin Laden used all manner of feints and bluffs to throw investigators off the trail of the suicide hijackers. Decoy terrorist teams and disinformation kept the CIA frantically guessing about an attack somewhere in the Middle East, Asia or Europe all last summer. Embassies were shuttered, warships were sent to sea, troops were put on the highest state of alert in the Persian Gulf. The Threat Committee of national-security specialists that meets twice a week in the White House complex to monitor alerts sent out so many warnings that they began to blur together. One plot seemed particularly concrete and menacing. At the end of July, authorities picked up an alleged bin Laden lieutenant named Djamel Begal in Dubai. He began singing-a little too fast, perhaps-about a plan to bomb the American Embassy in Paris. Was the threat real-or a diversion? The United States is heavily dependent on foreign intelligence services to roll up terror networks in their own countries. But typically, intelligence services prefer to keep an eye on suspected terrorists rather than prosecute them. To persuade a foreign government to turn over information on a terrorist suspect, much less arrest him, requires heavy doses of diplomacy. The task is not made easier if different branches of the American government squabble with each other. Last October, the USS Cole, a destroyer making a refueling stop in the Yemeni port of Aden, was nearly sunk by suicide bombers in a small boat. (An earlier attempt, against a different American warship docking in Yemen, fizzled when the suicide boat, overloaded with explosives, sank as it was leaving the dock. Bin Laden, nothing if not persistent, apparently ordered his hit men to try again.) FBI investigators immediately rushed to the scene, where they were coolly received by the Yemeni government. The G-men became apprehensive about their own security and demanded that they be allowed to carry assault rifles. The U.S. ambassador, Barbara Bodine, who regarded the FBI men as heavy-handed and undiplomatic, refused. After an awkward standoff between the G-men and embassy security officials in the embassy compound, the entire FBI team left the country-for three months. They did not return until just recently. It now appears that the same men who masterminded the Cole bombing may be tied to the devastating Sept. 11 assault on the United States.

Since January 2000 the CIA has been aware of a man named Tawfiq bin Atash, better known in terrorist circles by his nom de guerre \"Khallad.\" A Yemeni-born former freedom fighter in Afghanistan, Khallad assumed control of bin Laden's bodyguards and became a kind of capo in Al Qaeda. According to intelligence sources, Khallad helped coordinate the attack on the Cole. These same sources tell NEWSWEEK that in December 1999, Khallad was photographed by the Malaysian security service (which was working with the CIA to track terrorists) at a hotel in Kuala Lumpur. There, Khallad met with several bin Laden operatives. One was Fahad al-Quso, who, it later turned out, was assigned to videotape the suicide attack on the Cole (not all of Al Qaeda's men are James Bond: al-Quso botched the job when he overslept). Another was Khalid al-Midhar, who was traveling with an associate, Nawaf al-Hazmi, on a trip arranged by an organization known to U.S. intelligence as a \"logistical center\" and \"base of support\" for Al Qaeda. Those two names-al-Midhar and al-Hazmi-would resonate with intelligence officials on Sept. 11. Both men were listed among the hijackers of American Airlines Flight 77, the airliner that dive-bombed the Pentagon. Indeed, when one intelligence official saw the names on the list of suspects, he uttered an expletive. Just three weeks earlier, on Aug. 21, the CIA asked the INS to keep a watch out for al-Midhar. The INS reported that the man was already in the country; his only declared address was \"Marriott Hotel\" in New York. The CIA sent the FBI to find al-Midhar and his associate. The gumshoes were still looking on Sept. 11. DISTURBING CLUES At least one other name from the list of hijackers had shown up in the files of Western intelligence services: Mohamed Atta. He is an intriguing figure, both because of his role as the apparent senior man among the suicide hijackers, and because his background offers some disturbing clues about the high quality of bin Laden's recruits. The stereotype of an Islamic suicide bomber is that of a young man or teenage boy who has no job, no education, no prospects and no hope. He has been gulled into believing that if he straps a few sticks of dynamite around his waist and presses a button, he will stroll through the Gates of Paradise, where he will be bedded by virgins.

Atta in no way matches that pathetic creature. He did not come from a poor or desperate fundamentalist family. His father, Mohamed, described himself to NEWSWEEK as \"one of the most important lawyers in Cairo.\" The Atta family has a vacation home on the Mediterranean coast. Their Cairo apartment, with a sweeping view of downtown, is filled with ornate furniture and decorated with paintings of flamingos and women in head scarves. If anything, Atta seemed like a prodigy of Western modernism. His two sisters are university professors with Ph.D.s. Atta won a bachelor's degree in Cairo in 1990 and went to Germany for graduate work in urban studies. His thesis adviser in Hamburg, where he studied at the Technical University, called Atta \"a dear human being.\" Only in retrospect does it appear ominous that in his thesis dedication he wrote \"my life and my death belong to Allah, master of all worlds.\" Atta went to bars and rented videos (\"Ace Ventura,\" \"Storm of the Century\"), but he also grew a beard and began to dress more in Islamic style. He spoke often of Egypt's \"humiliation\" by the West. While polite, he also could be haughty. He scorned women, refusing to shake their hands. That was the only worry of Atta's proud father. \"I started reminding him to get married,\" Atta senior recounted to NEWSWEEK, as he chain-smoked cigarettes (\"American blend\"). \"Many times I asked him to marry a woman of any nationality-Turkish, German, Syrian-because he did not have a girlfriend like his colleagues. But he insisted he would marry an Egyptian. He was never touching woman, so how can he live?\" In October 1999, \"we found him a bride who was nice and delicate, the daughter of a former ambassador,\" said Atta senior. But Atta junior said he had to go back to Germany to finish his Ph.D. Actually, he was going to Florida to enroll in flight school. During his years as a student in Hamburg, Atta would disappear for long periods of time-possibly, to meet with his handlers. U.S. intelligence believes that Atta met in Europe this year with a midlevel Iraqi intelligence official.

The report immediately raised the question of Saddam Hussein's possible role in the Sept. 11 atrocity, but intelligence officials cautioned against reading too much into the link. Atta was in close communication with his superiors. On Sept. 4, one week before the bombing, he sent a package from a Kinko's in Hollywood, Fla., to a man named Mustafa Ahmed in the United Arab Emirates. \"We don't know for sure what was in the package,\" said a senior U.S. official. \"But Mustafa could be the key to bin Laden's finances. We're taking a hard look at him.\" (Several of the hijackers also wired money to Ahmed.) There are indications that Atta prepared very carefully for the attack, casing the airport in Boston and flying coast to coast on airliners. He may have had a backup plan: NEWSWEEK has learned that Atta had round-trip reservations between Baltimore and San Francisco in mid-October. Atta's father refuses to accept his son's role as a suicide bomber. \"It's impossible my son would participate in this attack,\" he said, claiming that he was a victim of a plot by Israeli intelligence to provoke the United States against Islam. \"The Mossad kidnapped my son,\" said Atta. \"He is the easiest person to kidnap, very surrendering, no physical power, no money for bodyguards. They used his name and identity... Then they killed him. This was done by the Mossad, using American pilots.\" Atta's rant was wild and sad-yet it was matched by the vituperations of the virulently anti-American Egyptian press, which spun fantastic plots featuring Mossad agents as the villains. Atta appears to have been inseparable from another hijacker, Marwan al-Shehhi, up to the moment they parted ways at Logan airport on the morning of Sept. 11. The FBI believes that al-Shehhi piloted the second jetliner, United Airlines Flight 175, into the South Tower of the World Trade Center. Al-Shehhi and Atta roomed together in Florida and were tossed out of Jones Flying Service School for unprofessional behavior. (Instructors complained about their \"attitude.\") They signed up together for a one-month membership at a gym, the Delray Beach Health Club. They went to Las Vegas, where the FBI believes that several hijackers kept girlfriends. They ate American, but told the employees at Hungry Howie's to hold the ham when they ordered their favorite pizza, a pie with all the toppings called \"The Works.\" As investigators piece together the lives of the hijackers, details that once seemed innocuous now loom large. Ziad Samir Jarrahi, a Lebanese man, took martial-arts lessons at a Dania, Fla., gym. \"What he wanted to study was street-fighting tactics-how to gain control over somebody with your hands, how to incapacitate someone with your hands,\" gym owner Bert Rodriguez told NEWSWEEK.

Did Jarrahi use those tactics in the last, desperate struggle in the cockpit of Flight 93, which crashed in a field outside Pittsburgh? Top law-enforcement officials reported that the voice recorder from Flight 93 picked up sounds of Arab and American voices shouting as the plane went down. Some very brave passengers stormed the cockpit in a last-ditch effort to seize control of the plane. Did they encounter Jarrahi and his newly honed fighting skills? 'BOMB ONBOARD' The available evidence suggests a death match. When the hijackers struck, at about 9:35 a.m., air-traffic controllers listening in on the frequency between the cockpit and the control center in Cleveland could hear screams, then a gap of 40 seconds with no sound, then more screams. Then, sources say, a nearly unintelligible voice said something like \"Bomb onboard.\" The controllers tried to raise the captain but received no response. Then radar showed the plane turning sharply-toward Washington, D.C. A voice in thickly accented English said, \"This is your captain. There is a bomb onboard. We are returning to the airport.\" In the passenger cabin, there was bloodshed and fear. At least one passenger was dead, probably with his throat slashed. In the back of the plane, however, five men, all burly athletes, were plotting a rush at the hijackers. \"We're going to do something,\" Todd Beamer told a GTE operator over the air phone. \"I know I'm not going to get out of this.\" He asked the operator to say the Lord's Prayer with him. \"Are you ready, guys?\" he asked. \"Let's roll.\" The cockpit voice recorder picked up someone, apparently a hijacker, screaming \"Get out of here! Get out of here!\" Then grunting, screaming and scuffling. Then silence. Such stories of heroic struggle will be-and should be-told and retold in the years to come. But now investigators are groping with uncertainty, asking: Who else is still out there? And will they strike again? A congressional delegation to CIA headquarters last week reported that mattresses were strewn on the floors. The race is still on, round the clock. Some investigators were trying to follow the money. They learned that in the week before the Sept. 11 attack, the hijackers began sending small amounts of money back to their paymasters in the Middle East. \"They were sending in their change,\" an intelligence source told NEWSWEEK. \"They were going to a place where they wouldn't need money.\" The hijackers apparently didn't need all that much to begin with:", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:011001newsweek.txt:17:b99dd74b60d9", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 6851, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "011001newsweek.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "011001newsweek", "chunk_index": 18, "text": "strewn on the floors.

That is 10 times more than was spent on the first World Trade Center bombing, but still a low-enough sum so the money could be moved in small denominations among trusted agents. Still, Al Qaeda is reputed to be expert at money laundering. Last week the pressure was on banks all over the world to open up their books (and on the banking lobby in the United States to drop its opposition to new laws that would make it easier for investigators to follow the money). The trail is likely to lead in some diplomatically awkward directions. Moderate Arab regimes are said to try to buy off terrorists. Much of bin Laden's money has come from wealthy Saudis who ostensibly give to Islamic charities. Some of those charities resemble the \"widows and orphans\" funds the Irish Republican Army uses to finance its bomb making. The money trail led investigators last week to a suspect whose background and motives could be the stuff of nightmares. Nabil al-Marabh, a former Boston taxi driver of Kuwaiti descent, is suspected of funneling thousands of dollars in wire transfer through Fleet Bank to the Middle East. The money was allegedly sent to a former Boston cabby implicated in a terrorist plot in Jordan that was foiled at the time of the millennium celebrations. At the same time, investigators say, al-Marabh may have exchanged phone calls with at least two of the Sept. 11 hijackers. Al-Marabh, who like a number of terrorists seems to have used Canada as a sometime sanctuary, was hard to track down. Canadian authorities first informed U.S. Customs about al-Marabh in July, and investigators opened a money-laundering probe. Last week the FBI raided an apartment in Detroit, where al-Marabh had been living. They found instead three men who had once worked as caterers at the Detroit airport (and kept their airport ID badges). In the apartment was a diagram of an airport runway and a day planner filled with notations in Arabic about \"the American base in Turkey,\" the \"American foreign minister\" and the name of an airport in Jordan. The FBI arrested the men, but al-Marabh was at the time getting a duplicate driver's license at the state department of motor vehicles. Not just any license.

Investigators have amassed what they described as a ''substantial'' amount of e-mail traffic among the hijackers. Some of the messages were exchanged in a mix of English and Arabic. None of the communications, authorities said Sunday, involved the use of encryption or other code to disguise the contents of the messages. At least two laptop computers seized in the United States were being examined closely by investigators. They hope to determine whether the machines contained information that could help identify associates of the hijackers in this country or provide leads about future terrorist attacks, a senior law enforcement official said. The disclosure appeared to be further evidence that the hijackers felt free to conduct their business in the open without much fear they would be discovered. Late last month, law enforcement officials said they believed that the hijackers or their associates did extensive scouting missions on various airline routes before settling on flights originating in Boston, Newark, N.J., and Washington. Investigators said they believe that the hijackers selected the four flights they commandeered Sept. 11 because passenger loads generally were light and the fuel tanks on the jets, all on transcontinental routes, were full. Official interest in the hijackers' methods of communication comes as the largest criminal investigation in U.S. history continues to widen. The attacks left nearly 6,000 people dead or missing.

Now the Feds are following the money, wondering about Iraq-and worrying about what's next By Evan Thomas NEWSWEEK Oct. 15 issue - On the night before they went out on a suicide mission to kill someone, the Assassins, the 12th-century cult of holy-warrior hit men, were given a taste of the Paradise that awaited. They smoked hashish (the word assassin derives from *hashashin,* users of hashish) and read in the Quran about the sensual rewards of martyrdom: Spend eternity in gardens of tranquillity. Youths of never-ending bloom will pass around to them decanters, beakers full of sparkling wine ... And suck fruits as they fancy. Bird meats as they relish. And companions with big beautiful eyes Like pearls within their shells ... Maybe that's what Majed Moqed was dreaming about late last summer when he wandered into the Adult Lingerie Center, a grim cinder-block building next to an auto-parts store in Beltsville, Md., sometime around midnight. In addition to red thongs and crotchless panties, the Adult Lingerie Center offers pornographic videos and books. But Moqed didn't seem to be having much fun. He flipped through some magazines, looked at the titles of some videos. Then, after about 10 minutes, he left. The night manager figured him for a cop. LOOKING FOR PATTERNS It's hard to imagine that the dirty movie Moqed paid $3 to watch on another night inspired him to give his life for Allah. But investigators are having a hard time figuring out exactly what did. In a large room at FBI headquarters in Washington, about a hundred analysts known as the Links Unit are feeding raw data-phone bills, ATM receipts, fake IDs, odd bits of Islamic verse, the testimony of Vegas strippers, the investigative tidbits from a global manhunt-into banks of computers. They are looking for patterns, examining the ties that bound Moqed and the 18 other suicide hijackers to one another and to their shadowy masters. The G-men are not just trying to solve a crime but hoping to avert another, bigger catastrophe. Yet despite an impressive sense of urgency and an unusual degree of cooperation between the historically wary CIA and FBI, the investigators are making slow progress. In part they are having difficulty following a well-concealed trail that weaves all over the world and far back in time. And they are just plain stumped by the hellish", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:011015newsweek.txt:0:145b1415349a", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 6857, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "011015newsweek.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "011015newsweek", "chunk_index": 1, "text": "one another and to their shadowy masters.

Yet despite an impressive sense of urgency and an unusual degree of cooperation between the historically wary CIA and FBI, the investigators are making slow progress. In part they are having difficulty following a well-concealed trail that weaves all over the world and far back in time. And they are just plain stumped by the hellish nature of their adversary. Consider the puzzle nagging at Charles Prouty, the chief of the FBI's Boston office. Why, he wonders, did Mohamed Atta, the suspected ringleader of the attack, and Abdulaziz Alomari make a quick side trip to Portland, Maine, on the eve of the attack? Were they meeting with someone? Were they trying to duck security at Logan airport? The two hijackers nearly missed the connecting flight from Portland to Boston on the morning of Sept. 11. (Their bags did miss the plane, giving investigators some early clues.) They could have thrown off a plan that had been so carefully plotted. An ex-Navy SEAL, Prouty told colleagues that it didn't make sense for the hijackers to violate the standard rules of \"op sec,\" military lingo for \"operational security.\" But then again, Al Qaeda isn't the Navy SEALs. Americans were chilled last week by the publication of a set of instructions, written by hand in Arabic, found in Atta's luggage: \"The Last Night,\" the document reads. \"1) Make an oath to die and renew your intentions. Shave excess hair from the body and wear cologne. Shower...\" On goes the assassins' manual, a weird mix of hygiene for homicide and exhortation to stay prayerful and focused, because the coming day will be \"the day, God willing, you spend with the women of Paradise.\" A NEW BREED OF SUICIDE ATTACKER Suicide squads are as old as the medieval Assassins and as modern as the Japanese kamikaze pilots of World War II. What makes Al Qaeda killers seem especially menacing is their apparent normalcy and independence. Most of the Black Tuesday hijackers were not like the Palestinian suicide bombers, poor losers brainwashed and bribed to strap on a bomb and take a one-way bus ride to Allah. The half-dozen leaders were educated and middle class. As pilots, several never did get the hang of takeoffs and landings, but their navigation skills were perfect. They depended more on the anonymity of American life than on their social skills. Still, an examination of the plotters' path, as it has emerged over the past month, reveals a mix of professionalism and fanaticism that will make the next attack hard to stop. **The top plotters met last August in an odd location: Las Vegas. ** ** They stayed in cheap hotels on a dreary stretch of the Strip frequented by ** dope dealers and $10 street", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:011015newsweek.txt:1:cdafdaffab7e", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 6858, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "011015newsweek.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "011015newsweek", "chunk_index": 2, "text": "perfect.

Perhaps they wished to be fortified for their mission by visiting a shrine to American decadence. Or maybe they just wanted a city that was easy to reach by air from their various cells in Florida, New Jersey and San Diego. In the past, Al Qaeda has sent a top lieutenant to trigger an attack and then slip away. FBI agents are searching records for any Middle Eastern-looking man who visited Vegas in August. The bureau is sure that six of the hijackers were present: the four presumed pilots and two others, Nawaf Alhazmi, 25, and Khalid Almihdhar, 26. These last two appear to have been an advance guard, arriving in San Diego in the fall of 1999. \"They were nice.\" recalled their - LANDLORD The duo was remarkable for being unremarkable. They bought a car, worked at odd jobs, obtained credit cards and insurance. \"They were nice,\" recalled their landlord, Abdussattar Shaikh, though he did observe that his tenants \"went out to make their phone calls.\" The two men visited strip clubs (Dancers and Cheetah's). Alhazmi apparently advertised, unsuccessfully, for a Mexican bride. Shaikh remembers that Alhazmi was \"very caring\" and even confiding: \"He told me once that his father had tried to kill him when he was a child. He never told me why, but he had a long knife scar on his forearm.\" Almihdhar seems to have been a bit dimmer and more standoffish. According to a flight instructor, Rick Garza, Almihdhar drew the airplane wings backward in class. Garza, who described the two as \"Dumb and Dumber,\" said that Almihdhar and Alhazmi were impatient students: \"They wanted to bypass primary training and go right to flying Boeings.\" A QAEDA CONNECTION The two terrorists may have been poor pilots, but they were well connected: in January 2000 they were videotaped by Malaysian secret police in Kuala Lumpur, meeting with a Qaeda operative who later emerged as a key suspect in the bombing of the USS Cole. And to make up for their deficient flying skills, Al Qaeda was able to provide reinforcements. In San Diego the two were joined by Hani Hanjour, the man who, investigators believe, eventually steered American Flight 77 into the Pentagon.

The shy, devout son of a well-to-do Saudi, Hanjour appears to have been the one true \"sleeper,\" living in the United States on and off for a decade and starting flight school in the mid-'90s. He, too, was a poor flight student, but he may have had a helping hand from his Qaeda bosses. It appears that, in June, an Algerian pilot, Lotfi Raissi, came to the United States to help train Hanjour on a jet simulator. (Raissi, now being held in England, denies that he was in on the plot.) No plotter moved around the world with more ease or frequency than Mohamed Atta. In the months before the hijacking, he traveled to Zurich (where he bought a couple of Swiss knives in the duty-free shop), Madrid and Prague. In Spain last July he seems to have touched base with a ring of Algerian terrorists. His meetings in Prague are more intriguing. NEWSWEEK has learned that Atta met not once but twice with Iraqi intelligence operatives, in June 2000 and again last April. The second meeting was with Farouk Hijazi, Iraq's ambassador to Turkey, who was called back to Baghdad before Sept. 11. One intelligence source called the two meetings interesting but still far from proof of Iraqi involvement in the plot. While polite when necessary, Atta had a seething temper and an almost pathological aversion to women. \"I don't want any women to go to my grave at all during the funeral or any occasion thereafter,\" Atta wrote in a 1996 will. \"I don't want a pregnant woman or a person who is not clean to come and say goodbye to me,\" Atta wrote, adding, \"the person who will wash my body near the genitals must wear gloves on his hand so he won't touch my genitals.\" A SECOND WAVE? This summer a second wave of hijackers slipped into the United States. These men were the muscle: their job would be to slit the throats of passengers and stab flight attendants (shouting \"Allahu Akbar\"-God is great!-as they \"slaughtered the animals,\" as their instructions put it). Most stayed aloof. \"You never heard them say a word,\" said Jamie Diaz, a neighbor of some of the men in Paterson, N.J. The apartment shared by hijacker brain as well as brawn in Paterson had no TV, no stereo, no furniture, except for three smallish mattresses on the floor for as many as six men. **\"Nobody ever saw them at mosques,\" said the city's mayor, ** ** Marty Barnes. \"But they liked the go-go clubs.\" ** The Qaeda men living in New Jersey", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:011015newsweek.txt:3:fbf14f239e09", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 6860, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "011015newsweek.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "011015newsweek", "chunk_index": 4, "text": "never heard them say a word,\" said Jamie Diaz, a neighbor of some of the men in Paterson, N.J.

A cost saver? Or Islamic asceticism? Investigators following the money believe there was plenty of it-at least $500,000 to finance the operation. But the money trail is well concealed. It leads from well-known commercial banks to Dubai in the United Arab Emirates, a financial fog bank. Investigators are looking for a paymaster named Mustafa Ahmed, who appears to have at least 10 aliases, three dates of birth, three Social Security numbers and four addresses in the United States. He was last seen boarding a plane from Dubai to Kara-chi, Pakistan, on Sept. 11. NEWSWEEK has learned that U.S. intelligence is especially interested in bin Laden's possible dealings with a company once known as Al Taqwa Management (\"Al Taqwa\" is Arabic for \"the wrath of God\"). But the Swiss authorities have cleared Al Taqwa, which recently changed its name to Nada Management. Already privacy-minded European governments and banks are grousing about a \"fishing expedition\" and balking at checking bank records against a list of more than 350 names supplied by U.S. investigators. The Sept. 11 plot was apparently planned abroad-but where? And by whom? Investigators have ransacked the \"terror apartment\" in Hamburg, Germany, that Atta shared with Ziad Samir Jarrah, one of the presumed Sept. 11 suicide pilots, along with at least two other possible conspirators now on the lam. One roommate, Said Bahaji, is believed to be the hijackers' logistics man, providing passports, IDs, apartments. The other, Ramzi bin al-Shib, tried and failed to get a visa for pilot training in the United States; significantly, he received a phone call sometime last summer from Zacarias Moussaoui, who was turned in to the Feds by a suspicious flight instructor in Minnesota last August. Had the FBI moved a little faster on Moussaoui, it's possible the Sept. 11 attack might have been averted. FBI officials are still sorting out why a request from the FBI's field office for permission to examine Moussaoui's computer hard drive-just two weeks before the attack-was turned down by headquarters, as reported by NEWSWEEK last week. The FBI knew from French intelligence that Moussaoui was an Islamic extremist, but he wasn't connected to any terror group-a prerequisite to getting a national-security warrant. The FBI agents in Minneapolis then sought a criminal warrant to search Moussaoui's computer. But they were again turned down because current federal law prohibits the bureau from sharing", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:011015newsweek.txt:4:2d7e58911450", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 6861, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "011015newsweek.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "011015newsweek", "chunk_index": 5, "text": "field office for permission to examine Moussaoui's computer hard drive-just two weeks before the attack-was turned down by headquarters, as reported by NEWSWEEK last week.

But they were again turned down because current federal law prohibits the bureau from sharing information in criminal probes with intelligence investigators. This bureaucratic stumbling block is being cited by federal law-enforcement officials as justification for easing the rules. After Sept. 11, gumshoes found incriminating evidence on the hard drive, including instructions on flying crop- dusters. Was Moussaoui planning some kind of chemical-weapon attack? Now in jail, the French Moroccan isn't talking. His mother, Aicha, interviewed over the phone by NEWSWEEK from her home in Narbonne, France, lamented that her son had been \"brainwashed\" into becoming an Islamic extremist. As a child, \"he never cried or made a fuss,\" she said. \"He didn't wake me up at night, and he was always laughing.\" But when teachers at his school told Moussaoui that he would be better off going to trade school, \"he began to rebel.\" He started smoking hash and watching porn movies. \"I'm glad that he didn't participate in the attacks,\" she said. \"Maybe I'll write him a letter.\" She paused. \"I don't know where to send it. I don't know anything now,\" she said. The FBI and CIA are going to have to know a whole lot more to stop the next attack.

WALD with KEVIN SACK (NYT) 2147 words WASHINGTON, Oct. 15 -- American Airlines Flight 11 had fallen mysteriously silent. The air traffic controller called over and over for a response. None came. Then he heard an unidentified voice from the cockpit: ''We have some planes. Just stay quiet, and you'll be O.K. We are returning to the airport.'' The controller, confused, asked, ''Who's trying to call me?'' No response. Then he heard the voice again: ''Nobody move please; we are going back to the airport. Don't try to make any stupid moves.'' The man was transmitting on the frequency monitored by pilots and air traffic controllers, either because he thought he was talking to the passengers or because one of the crew had activated the radio microphone, and his voice was the first hint of the horror of Sept. 11. Transcripts of the communications between pilots and controllers, obtained by The New York Times, reveal the dawning awareness of the terror in cockpits and control centers. Together with interviews and other documents, they offer a previously unseen view of how, moment by moment, a bell-clear and routine morning turned to confusion and then to horror. [Excerpts, Page B9.] In the cool, clipped jargon of aviation, signals of unprecedented disaster bounced between the ground and air as airline and military personnel struggled to understand and then control the chaos. The first sure sign of a hijacking was picked up by United Airlines Flight 175, which left Boston for Los Angeles at 8:14 a.m. Just after it took off, the air traffic controller had asked for help from other pilots in finding Flight 11, which was already missing. ''We heard a suspicious transmission on our departure from BOS,'' the pilot reported at 8:41 a.m., just after takeoff. ''Sounds like someone keyed the mike and said everyone stay in your seats.'' Within 90 seconds, his plane became the next piece of the unspooling disaster.", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:011016nytimes.txt:0:3b491874479b", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 6864, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "011016nytimes.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "011016nytimes", "chunk_index": 1, "text": "Flight 175, which left Boston for Los Angeles at 8:14 a.m. Just after it took off, the air traffic controller had asked for help from other pilots in finding Flight 11, which was already missing. ''We heard a suspicious transmission on our departure from BOS,'' the pilot reported at 8:41 a.m., just after takeoff. ''Sounds like someone keyed the mike and said everyone stay in your seats.'' Within 90 seconds, his plane became the next piece of the unspooling disaster. Flight 175 took an errant turn off its scheduled course to Los Angeles and ceased communication with the ground. ''There's no transponder, no nothing, and no one's talking to him,'' the controller said. And at 8:50 a.m., an unidentified pilot said over the common frequency: ''Anybody know what that smoke is in Lower Manhattan?'' Flight 11 had struck the north tower of the World Trade Center just minutes before, and the air traffic controller's repeated calls for Flight 175 were met with another awful silence. At 8:53, after Flight 175 had screamed south over the Hudson Valley at about 500 miles per hour -- more than double the legal speed -- the reality was becoming clear to the controller on the ground on Long Island. ''We may have a hijack,'' he said. ''We have some problems over here right now.'' He knew just half of it. Moments after the first jet hit the World Trade Center, a controller in Indianapolis was trying to make contact with American Flight 77, which was flying from Dulles International Airport outside Washington to Los Angeles. The pilot had confirmed receiving directions to fly towards a navigation beacon at Falmouth, Ky., but then failed to respond to calls from the ground. ''American 77, Indy,'' the controller said, over and over. ''American 77, Indy, radio check. How do you read?'' By 8:56 a.m., it was evident that Flight 77 was lost. The Federal Aviation Administration, already in contact with the Pentagon about the hijackings out of Boston, notified the North American Aerospace Defense Command, or Norad, of American 77 at 9:24, 28 minutes later. Fighters scrambled immediately. The F.A.A. controller called American's dispatch office in Dallas, and the dispatcher there to try to raise Flight 77 on another radio, but failed. At 9:09 a.m., the American dispatcher said he could not reach Flight 77, but said the company had ''an unconfirmed report the second airplane hit the World Trade Center and exploded.'' He seemed to suggest that American 77 might be that plane, but in fact American 77 was racing back over Pittsburgh, toward Washington. At 9:33 a.m., the same air traffic controller at Dulles who had handled the perfectly normal departure of American 77 about 70 minutes earlier, spotted an unidentified blip on the radar screen. The Dulles controllers called their counterparts at Reagan National Airport to report that a ''fast moving primary target,'' meaning", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:011016nytimes.txt:1:07d3acfaa990", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 6865, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "011016nytimes.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "011016nytimes", "chunk_index": 2, "text": "the World Trade Center and exploded.''

At 9:33 a.m., the same air traffic controller at Dulles who had handled the perfectly normal departure of American 77 about 70 minutes earlier, spotted an unidentified blip on the radar screen. The Dulles controllers called their counterparts at Reagan National Airport to report that a ''fast moving primary target,'' meaning an airplane with no transponder, was moving east, headed toward the forbidden airspace over the White House, the Capitol and the Washington Monument. A Dulles supervisor picked up a hot line to tell the Secret Service at the White House. The president was in Florida, but Vice President Dick Cheney was in the White House; Secret Service agents hustled him into an underground bunker there. At 9:36 a.m., National Airport, which was on American 77's flight path, asked a military C-130 cargo plane, taking off on a scheduled flight from Andrews Air Force Base -- in Maryland, on the other side of the District of Columbia -- to intercept and identify the fast-moving target. The crew of the C-130 said it was a Boeing 757, moving low and fast. The airplane was headed for the heart of Washington. But as it crossed the Pentagon at perhaps 7,000 feet -- the exact altitude is uncertain because its transponder had been turned off -- it began a 360-degree turn to the right that brought nearly to ground level. It crashed into the west side of the Pentagon at 9:38 a.m. At impact, it was moving at well over 500 m.p.h., which both maximized the destruction and made the plane easier to handle. Investigators later determined that it had been flying on autopilot on its path over the Pentagon. Pilots use autopilot to minimize their workload on long days and to assure a precise course and smooth ride. Just minutes before the crash at the Pentagon, United Airlines Flight 93, flying from Newark to San Francisco, went off course near Cleveland. It now appears that Flight 93 received a warning of the hijackings. Cutting through the background noise in the cockpit of Flight 93, the crew would have heard the sound of an electronic ''ping'' like one that might announce the arrival of e-mail message on a home computer. It was a text message coming by radio, from a flight dispatcher near Chicago. In green letters on a black background, it said, ''Beware, cockpit intrusion.'' The message was sent by a dispatcher, sitting at the ''transcontinental'' desk at United's operations center near O'Hare International Airport, who had been assigned to follow both 175 and 93, as well as 14 other airplanes that morning. After United 175 was confirmed to have been hijacked, he sent the message to all the planes he was monitoring.", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:011016nytimes.txt:2:a237f9340fba", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 6866, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "011016nytimes.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "011016nytimes", "chunk_index": 3, "text": "message coming by radio, from a flight dispatcher near Chicago.

After United 175 was confirmed to have been hijacked, he sent the message to all the planes he was monitoring. In the cockpit of Flight 93, Capt. Jason Dahl and his first officer, Leroy Homer, continued westbound. In the last few moments of the pre-attack world, there was no particular reason for them to react radically. ''Getting a message like that on any day in the U.S.A., well, I'd think, 'Those poor bastards,' '' one aviation official said. ''Then I'd think, 'It's already happened; it's probably not going to happen again.' '' Since Sept. 11, details have emerged of a struggle between hijackers and passengers on Flight 93. People involved in air traffic control said the F.B.I. seized the air traffic tapes of the conversations with that airplane, and no transcript was made available of air-to-ground communications for the flight. But according to a person who heard the tape, ''a very noisy sound of a confrontation was heard on the frequency, very garbled, but with some discernible phrase like, 'Hey, get out of here!' '' There was the sound of a foreign language on the frequency; controllers thought it was Arabic. Flight 93 crashed in a field western Pennsylvania at 10:10 a.m. But before the final cockpit intrusion of the morning, one of the pilots apparently turned to the e-mail unit that carried the warning from Chicago, touched a button that made the screen display a keyboard and typed a one-word reply: ''Confirmed.'' By the time the F-16's from Langley Air Force Base in Hampton, Va., arrived, the damage was done. At both Langley and at Otis Air National Guard Base at Falmouth, Mass., on Cape Cod, two sets of fighter pilots were spending the morning as usual: sitting, waiting, and wondering whether they would escape the day without hearing the shrill klaxon blast that occasionally sent them racing to the cockpits of their supersonic jets. For years, the threat of an incoming aerial attack on the American homeland had been considered so minor that on the morning of Sept. 11, the entire country was being defended by 14 Air National Guard planes dispersed among seven bases. The first call came to Otis about the hijacking of Flight 11 came at 8:46 a.m., six minutes after the F.A.A. had first notified the North East Air Defense Sector in Rome, N.Y., a division of Norad. Six minutes later two vintage F-15's, built in 1977 and equipped with heat-seeking and radar-guided missiles, had been scrambled, according to a Norad timeline.

Six minutes later two vintage F-15's, built in 1977 and equipped with heat-seeking and radar-guided missiles, had been scrambled, according to a Norad timeline. One pilot was a part-time Guardsman who flew a commercial plane as his day job; the other jet was flown by a full-time member of the Air National Guard. But the orders came too late. The first plane was plunging into the World Trade Center when the Otis pilots were racing to their jets. United Flight 175 hit the second tower at 9:02 a.m., 10 minutes after the fighters were airborne, when the F-15's were about 71 miles and eight minutes away. When they arrived, the helpless pilots got the first aerial views of the devastation. The three F16's at Langley, all of them assigned to the North Dakota Air National Guard's 119th Fighter Wing, nicknamed the Happy Hooligans, were also scrambled too late to intercept American Flight 77 before it crashed into the Pentagon. But if United Airlines Flight 93 had not crashed in Pennsylvania, the three pilots from Langley -- two of them commercial airline pilots themselves -- may have faced the nightmarish decision of whether to shoot down the commercial airliner, along with its 38 passengers and crew of seven. ''It kept us from having to do the unthinkable,'' said Maj. Gen. Mike J. Haugen, adjutant general of the North Dakota National Guard, ''and that is to use your own weapons and own training against your own citizens.'' The military has not allowed the pilots to be interviewed, and The Times has agreed not to print their names because of security concerns. But details of their activities on Sept. 11 have emerged through interviews with other Guard officials. At Langley, the pilot designated as the flight lead, a 33-year-old pilot for Northwest Airlines, was getting a cup of coffee when someone yelled from the television room: ''Hey, an airplane just hit the World Trade Center!'' ''All of a sudden,'' said Col. Lyle Andvik, a member and former commander of the unit, ''something happens that none of us can believe. They get an order from Northeast Air Defense Sector, the pilots get a scramble horn, and they're down the stairs, out the door, in the jets and off they go. At the time, they didn't realize why they were being scrambled. They didn't realize that other planes had been hijacked.'' At 9:30 a.m., six minutes after receiving their orders from the defense sector, code-named Huntress, three F-16's were airborne, according to the Norad timeline. At first, the planes were directed", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:011016nytimes.txt:4:706195ae74c7", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 6868, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "011016nytimes.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "011016nytimes", "chunk_index": 5, "text": "They get an order from Northeast Air Defense Sector, the pilots get a scramble horn, and they're down the stairs, out the door, in the jets and off they go.

At 9:30 a.m., six minutes after receiving their orders from the defense sector, code-named Huntress, three F-16's were airborne, according to the Norad timeline. At first, the planes were directed toward New York at top speed, and probably reached 600 m.p.h. within two minutes, General Haugen said. Then, flying in formation, they were vectored toward the west and given a new flight target: Reagan National Airport. The planes, each loaded with six missiles, had slowed slightly to just under supersonic speed, flying at about 25,000 feet, when they heard over their radio headsets that the F.A.A. had ordered all civilian aircraft to land. The next sign of how serious the situation had become arrived in the form of a squawk over the plane's transponder, a code that suggests almost an emergency wartime situation. ''They get the squawk and they've heard that planes are supposed to land and then Huntress says, 'Hooligan flight, can you confirm that the Pentagon is on fire?' '' General Haugen said, adding that the lead flier looked down and confirmed that the Pentagon was on fire. Then the pilots received the most surreal order of the awful morning. ''A person came on the radio,'' General Haugen said, ''and identified themselves as being with the Secret Service, and he said, 'I want you to protect the White House at all costs.'

HERSH** **How vulnerable are the Saudi royals?** Issue of 2001-10-22 Posted 2001-10-16 Since 1994 or earlier, the National Security Agency has been collecting electronic intercepts of conversations between members of the Saudi Arabian royal family, which is headed by King Fahd. The intercepts depict a regime increasingly corrupt, alienated from the country's religious rank and file, and so weakened and frightened that it has brokered its future by channelling hundreds of millions of dollars in what amounts to protection money to fundamentalist groups that wish to overthrow it. The intercepts have demonstrated to analysts that by 1996 Saudi money was supporting Osama bin Laden's Al Qaeda and other extremist groups in Afghanistan, Lebanon, Yemen, and Central Asia, and throughout the Persian Gulf region. \"Ninety-six is the key year,\" one American intelligence official told me. \"Bin Laden hooked up to all the bad guys-it's like the Grand Alliance- and had a capability for conducting large-scale operations.\" The Saudi regime, he said, had \"gone to the dark side.\" In interviews last week, current and former intelligence and military officials portrayed the growing instability of the Saudi regime-and the vulnerability of its oil reserves to terrorist attack-as the most immediate threat to American economic and political interests in the Middle East. The officials also said that the Bush Administration, like the Clinton Administration, is refusing to confront this reality, even in the aftermath of the September 11th terrorist attacks. The Saudis and the Americans arranged a meeting between Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld and King Fahd during a visit by Rumsfeld to Saudi Arabia shortly before the beginning of the air war in Afghanistan, and pictures of the meeting were transmitted around the world. The United States, however, has known that King Fahd has been incapacitated since suffering a severe stroke, in late 1995. A Saudi adviser told me last week that the King, with round-the-clock medical treatment, is able to sit in a chair and open his eyes, but is usually unable to recognize even his oldest friends. Fahd is being kept on the throne, the N.S.A. intercepts indicate, because of a bitter family power struggle. Fahd's nominal successor is Crown Prince Abdullah, his half brother, who is to some extent the de-facto ruler-he and Prince Sultan, the defense minister, were the people Rumsfeld really came to see. But there is infighting about money: Abdullah has been urging his fellow-princes to address the problem", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:011022saudiarabians911connections.txt:0:203506a627ae", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 6871, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "011022saudiarabians911connections.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "011022saudiarabians911connections", "chunk_index": 1, "text": "and open his eyes, but is usually unable to recognize even his oldest friends.

But there is infighting about money: Abdullah has been urging his fellow-princes to address the problem of corruption in the kingdom-unsuccessfully, according to the intercepts. \"The only reason Fahd's being kept alive is so Abdullah can't become king,\" a former White House adviser told me. The American intelligence officials have been particularly angered by the refusal of the Saudis to help the F.B.I. and the C.I.A. run \"traces\"-that is, name checks and other background information-on the nineteen men, more than half of them believed to be from Saudi Arabia, who took part in the attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon. \"They knew that once we started asking for a few traces the list would grow,\" one former official said. \"It's better to shut it down right away.\" He pointed out that thousands of disaffected Saudis have joined fundamentalist groups throughout the Middle East. Other officials said that there is a growing worry inside the F.B.I. and the C.I.A. that the actual identities of many of those involved in the attacks may not be known definitively for months, if ever. Last week, a senior intelligence official confirmed the lack of Saudi coöperation and told me, angrily, that the Saudis \"have only one constant-and it's keeping themselves in power.\" The N.S.A. intercepts reveal the hypocrisy of many in the Saudi royal family, and why the family has become increasingly estranged from the vast majority of its subjects. Over the years, unnerved by the growing strength of the fundamentalist movement, it has failed to deal with the underlying issues of severe unemployment and inadequate education, in a country in which half the population is under the age of eighteen. Saudi Arabia's strict interpretation of Islam, known as Wahhabism, and its use of mutawwa'in-religious police-to enforce prayer, is rivalled only by the Taliban's. And yet for years the Saudi princes-there are thousands of them-have kept tabloid newspapers filled with accounts of their drinking binges and partying with prostitutes, while taking billions of dollars from the state budget. The N.S.A. intercepts are more specific. In one call, Prince Nayef, who has served for more than two decades as interior minister, urges a subordinate to withhold from the police evidence of the hiring of prostitutes, presumably by members of the royal family. According to the summary, Nayef said that he didn't want the \"client list\" released under any circumstances.

According to the summary, Nayef said that he didn't want the \"client list\" released under any circumstances. The intercepts produced a stream of sometimes humdrum but often riveting intelligence from the telephone calls of several senior members of the royal family, including Abdullah; Nayef; Sultan, whose son Prince Bandar has been the Saudi ambassador to the United States since 1983; and Prince Salman, the governor of Riyadh, Saudi Arabia's capital. There was constant telephoning about King Fahd's health after his stroke, and scrambling to take advantage of the situation. On January 8, 1997, Prince Sultan told Bandar about a flight that he and Salman had shared with the King. Sultan complained that the King \"barely spoke to anyone,\" according to the summary of the intercept, because he was \"too medicated.\" The King, Sultan added, was \"a prisoner on the plane.\" Sultan's comments became much more significant a few days later, when the N.S.A. intercepted a conversation in which Sultan told Bandar that the King had agreed to a complicated exchange of fighter aircraft with the United States that would bring five F-16s into the Royal Saudi Air Force. Fahd was evidently incapable of making such an agreement, or of preventing anyone from dropping his name in a money-making deal. In the intercepts, princes talk openly about bilking the state, and even argue about what is an acceptable percentage to take. Other calls indicate that Prince Bandar, while serving as ambassador, was involved in arms deals in London, Yemen, and the Soviet Union that generated millions of dollars in \"commissions.\" In a PBS \"Frontline\" interview broadcast on October 9th, Bandar, asked about the reports of corruption in the royal family, was almost upbeat in his response. The family had spent nearly four hundred billion dollars to develop Saudi Arabia, he said. \"If you tell me that building this whole country . . . we misused or got corrupted with fifty billion, I'll tell you, 'Yes.'. . . So what? We did not invent corruption, nor did those dissidents, who are so genius, discover it.\" The intercepts make clear, however, that Crown Prince Abdullah was insistent on stemming the corruption. In November of 1996, for example, he complained about the billions of dollars that were being diverted by royal family members from a huge state-financed project to renovate the mosque in Mecca. He urged the princes to get their off-budget expenses under control; such expenses are known as the hiding place for payoff money. (Despite its oil revenues, Saudi Arabia has been running a budget deficit for more than a decade, and now has a large national debt.)

(Despite its oil revenues, Saudi Arabia has been running a budget deficit for more than a decade, and now has a large national debt.) A few months later, according to the intercepts, Abdullah blocked a series of real-estate deals by one of the princes, enraging members of the royal family. Abdullah further alarmed the princes by issuing a decree declaring that his sons would not be permitted to go into partnerships with foreign companies working in the kingdom. Abdullah is viewed by Sultan and other opponents as a leader who could jeopardize the kingdom's most special foreign relationship-someone who is willing to penalize the United States, and its oil and gas companies, because of Washington's support for Israel. In an intercept dated July 13, 1997, Prince Sultan called Bandar in Washington, and informed him that he had told Abdullah \"not to be so confrontational with the United States.\" The Fahd regime was a major financial backer of the Reagan Administration's anti-Communist campaign in Latin America and of its successful proxy war in Afghanistan against the Soviet Union. Oil money bought the Saudis enormous political access and leverage in Washington. Working through Prince Bandar, they have contributed hundreds of millions of dollars to charities and educational programs here. American construction and oil companies do billions of dollars' worth of business every year with Saudi Arabia, which is the world's largest oil producer. At the end of last year, Halliburton, the Texas-based oil-supply business formerly headed by Vice-President Dick Cheney, was operating a number of subsidiaries in Saudi Arabia. In the Clinton era, the White House did business as usual with the Saudis, urging them to buy American goods, like Boeing aircraft. The kingdom was seen as an American advocate among the oil-producing nations of the Middle East. The C.I.A. was discouraged from conducting any risky intelligence operations inside the country and, according to one former official, did little recruiting among the Saudi population, which limited the United States government's knowledge of the growth of the opposition to the royal family. In 1994, Mohammed al-Khilewi, the first secretary at the Saudi Mission to the United Nations, defected and sought political asylum in the United States. He brought with him, according to his New York lawyer, Michael J. Wildes, some fourteen thousand internal government documents depicting the Saudi royal family's corruption, human-rights abuses, and financial support for terrorists. He claimed to have evidence that the Saudis had given financial and technical support to Hamas, the extremist Islamic group whose target is Israel.

He claimed to have evidence that the Saudis had given financial and technical support to Hamas, the extremist Islamic group whose target is Israel. There was a meeting at the lawyer's office with two F.B.I. agents and an Assistant United States Attorney. \"We gave them a sampling of the documents and put them on the table,\" Wildes told me last week. \"But the agents refused to accept them.\" He and his client heard nothing further from federal authorities. Al-Khilewi, who was granted asylum, is now living under cover. The Saudis were also shielded from Washington's foreign-policy bureaucracy. A government expert on Saudi affairs told me that Prince Bandar dealt exclusively with the men at the top, and never met with desk officers and the like. \"Only a tiny handful of people inside the government are familiar with U.S.-Saudi relations,\" he explained. \"And that is purposeful.\" **In the aftermath of the terrorist attacks in New York and Washington, the royal family has repeatedly insisted that Saudi Arabia has made no contributions to radical Islamic groups. When the Saudis were confronted by press reports that some of the substantial funds that the monarchy routinely gives to Islamic charities may actually have gone to Al Qaeda and other terrorist networks, they denied any knowledge of such transfers. The intercepts, however, have led many in the intelligence community to conclude otherwise.** **The Bush Administration has chosen not to confront the Saudi leadership over its financial support of terror organizations and its refusal to help in the investigation. \"As far as the Saudi Arabians go, they've been nothing but coöperative,\" President Bush said at a news conference on September 24th.** The following day, the Saudis agreed to formally cut off diplomatic relations with the Taliban leadership in Afghanistan. Eight days later, at a news conference in Saudi Arabia with Prince Sultan, the defense minister, Donald Rumsfeld was asked if he had given the Saudis a list of the September 11th terrorist suspects for processing by their intelligence agencies. Rumsfeld, who is admired by many in the press for his bluntness, answered evasively: \"I am, as I said, not involved with the Federal Bureau of Investigation that is conducting the investigation. . . . I have every reason to believe that that relationship between our two countries is as close, that any information I am sure has been made available to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.\" The Saudis gave Rumsfeld something in return-permission for U.S. forces to use a command-and-control center, built before the Gulf War, in the pending air war against the Taliban.

Over the past few years, the Saudis have also allowed the United States to use forward bases on Saudi soil for special operations, as long as there was no public mention of the arrangements. While the intelligence-community members I spoke with praised the Air Force and the Navy for their performance in Afghanistan last week, which did much to boost morale in the military and among the American citizenry, they were crestfallen about an incident that occurred on the first night of the war-an incident that was emblematic, they believe, of the constraints placed by the government on the military's ability to wage war during the last decade. That night, an unmanned Predator reconnaissance aircraft, under the control of the C.I.A., was surveilling the roads leading out of Kabul. The Predator, which costs forty million dollars and cruises at speeds as slow as eighty miles an hour, is equipped with imaging radar and an array of infrared and television cameras that are capable of beaming high-resolution images to ground stations around the world. The plane was equipped with two powerful Hellfire missiles, designed as antitank weapons. The Predator identified a group of cars and trucks fleeing the capital as a convoy carrying Mullah Omar, the Taliban leader. Under a previously worked-out agreement, one knowledgeable official said, the C.I.A. did not have the authority to \"push the button.\" Nor did the nearby command-and-control suite of the Fifth Fleet, in Bahrain, where many of the war plans had been drawn up. Rather, the decision had to be made by the officers on duty at the headquarters of the United States Central Command, or CENTCOM, at MacDill Air Force Base, in Florida. The Predator tracked the convoy to a building where Omar, accompanied by a hundred or so guards and soldiers, took cover. The precise sequence of events could not be fully learned, but intelligence officials told me that there was an immediate request for a full-scale assault by fighter bombers. At that point, however, word came from General Tommy R. Franks, the CENTCOM commander, saying, as the officials put it, \"My JAG\"-Judge Advocate General, a legal officer-\"doesn't like this, so we're not going to fire.\" Instead, the Predator was authorized to fire a missile in front of the building-\"bounce it off the front door,\" one officer said, \"and see who comes out, and take a picture.\" CENTCOM suggested that the Predator then continue to", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:011022saudiarabians911connections.txt:5:aa69973984ac", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 6876, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "011022saudiarabians911connections.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "011022saudiarabians911connections", "chunk_index": 6, "text": "a full-scale assault by fighter bombers.

The Hellfire, however, could not target the area in front of the building-in military parlance, it could not \"get a signature\" on the dirt there-and it was then agreed that the missile would attack a group of cars parked in front, presumably those which had carried Omar and his retinue. The missile was fired, and it \"obliterated the cars,\" an official said. \"But no one came out.\" It was learned later from an operative on the ground that Omar and his guards had indeed been in the convoy and had assumed at the time that the firing came from rocket-propelled grenades launched by nearby troops from the Northern Alliance. A group of soldiers left the building and looked for the enemy. They found nothing, and Omar and his convoy departed. A short time later, the building was targeted and destroyed by F-18s. Mullah Omar survived. Days afterward, top Administration officials were still seething about the incident. \"If it was a fuckup, I could live with it,\" one senior official said. \"But it's not a fuckup-it's an outrage.This isn't like you're six years old and your mother calls you to come in for lunch and you say, 'Time out.' If anyone thinks otherwise, go look at the World Trade Center or the Pentagon.\" A senior military officer viewed the failure to strike immediately as a symptom of \"a cultural issue\"-\"a slow degradation of the system due to political correctness: 'We want you to kill the guy, but not the guy next to him.' No collateral damage.\" Others saw the cultural problem as one of bureaucratic, rather than political, correctness. Either way, the failure to attack has left Defense Secretary Rumsfeld \"kicking a lot of glass and breaking doors,\" the officer said. \"But in the end I don't know if it'll mean any changes.\" A Pentagon planner also noted that some of the camps the bombers were hitting were empty. In fact, he added, it became evident even before the bombing that troops of the Northern Alliance had moved into many of the unused Taliban camps. The Alliance soldiers came up with a novel way of alerting American planners to their new location, the officer said: \"They walked around holding up white sheets so when the satellites came by they're saying, 'Hey, we're the good guys.' \" The American military response has triggered alarm in the international oil community and", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:011022saudiarabians911connections.txt:6:6e7ea86c16f1", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 6877, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "011022saudiarabians911connections.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "011022saudiarabians911connections", "chunk_index": 7, "text": "In fact, he added, it became evident even before the bombing that troops of the Northern Alliance had moved into many of the unused Taliban camps.

The report was \"so sensitive,\" a former C.I.A. officer told me, \"that it was put on typed paper,\" and not into the agency's computer system, meaning that distribution was limited to a select few. According to someone who saw the report, it concluded that with only a small amount of explosives terrorists could take the oil fields off line for two years. The concerns, both in America and in Saudi Arabia, about the security of the fields have become more urgent than ever since September 11th. A former high-level intelligence official depicted the Saudi rulers as nervously \"sitting on a keg of dynamite\"-that is, the oil reserves. \"They're petrified that somebody's going to light the fuse.\" \"The United States is hostage to the stability of the Saudi system,\" a prominent Middle Eastern oil man, who did not wish to be cited by name, told me in a recent interview. \"It's time to start facing the truth. The war was declared by bin Laden, but there are thousands of bin Ladens. They are setting the game-the agenda. It's a new form of war. This fabulous military machine you have is completely useless.\" The oil man, who has worked closely with the Saudi leadership for three decades, added, \"People like me have been deceiving you. We talk about how you don't understand Islam, but it's a vanilla analysis. We try to please you, but we've been aggrieved for years.\" The Saudi regime \"will explode in time,\" he said. \"It has been playing a delicate game.\" As for the terrorists responsible for the September 11th attacks, he said, \"Now they decide the timing. If they do a similar operation in Saudi Arabia, the price of oil will go up to one hundred dollars a barrel\"-more than four times what it is today. In the nineteen-eighties, in an effort to relieve political pressure on the regime, the Saudi leadership relinquished some of its authority to the mutawwa'in and permitted them to have a greater role in day-to-day life. One U.S. government Saudi expert complained last week that religious leaders had been allowed to take control of the press and the educational system. \"Today, two-thirds of the Saudi Ph.D.s are in Islamic studies,\" a former Presidential aide", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:011022saudiarabians911connections.txt:7:2d001e2cc5c3", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 6878, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "011022saudiarabians911connections.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "011022saudiarabians911connections", "chunk_index": 8, "text": "than four times what it is today.

There was little attempt over the years by American diplomats or the White House to moderate the increasingly harsh rhetoric about the U.S. \"The United States was caught up in private agreements\"-with the Saudi princes-\"while this shit was spewing in the Saudi press,\" the former aide said. \"That was a huge mistake.\" A senior American diplomat who served many years in Saudi Arabia recalled his foreboding upon attending a training exercise at the kingdom's most prestigious military academy, in Riyadh: \"It was hot, and I watched the cadets doing drills. The officers were lounging inside a suradiq\"-a large pavilion-\"with cold drinks, calling out orders on loudspeakers. I thought to myself, How many of these young men would follow and die for these officers?\" The diplomat said he came away from his most recent tour in Saudi Arabia convinced that \"it wouldn't take too much for a group of twenty or thirty fundamentalist enlisted men to take charge. How would the kingdom deal with the shock of something ruthless, small, highly motivated, and of great velocity?\" There is little that the United States can do now, the diplomat said. \"The Saudis have been indulged for so many decades.They are so spoiled. They've always had it their way. There's hardly anything we could say that would impede the 'majestic instancy' of their progress. We're their janissaries.\" He was referring to the captives who became élite troops of the Ottoman Empire. \"The policy dilemma is this,\" a senior general told me. \"How do we help the Saudis make a transition without throwing them over the side?\" Referring to young fundamentalists who have been demonstrating in the Saudi streets, he said, \"The kids are bigger than the Daddy.\" FAIR USE NOTICE: This site contains copyrighted material the use of which has not always been specifically authorized by the copyright owner.

Ottaway and Joe Stephens Washington Post Staff Writers * October 29, 2001; Page A1 Over three years and on as many continents, U.S. officials met in public and secret at least 20 times with Taliban representatives to discuss ways the regime could bring suspected terrorist Osama bin Laden to justice. Talks continued until just days before the Sept. 11 attacks, and Taliban representatives repeatedly suggested they would hand over bin Laden if their conditions were met, sources close to the discussions said. Throughout the years, however, State Department officials refused to soften their demand that bin Laden face trial in the U.S. justice system. It also remained murky whether the Taliban envoys, representing at least one division of the fractious Islamic movement, could actually deliver on their promises. The exchanges lie at the heart of a long and largely untold history of diplomatic efforts between the State Department and Afghanistan's ruling regime that paralleled covert CIA actions to take bin Laden. In the end, both diplomatic and covert efforts proved fruitless. In interviews, U.S. participants and sources close to the Taliban discussed the exchanges in detail and debated whether the State Department should have been more flexible in its hard-line stance. Earlier this month, President Bush summarily rejected another Taliban offer to give up bin Laden to a neutral third country. \"We know he's guilty. Turn him over,\" Bush said. Some Afghan experts argue that throughout the negotiations, the United States never recognized the Taliban need for aabroh, the Pashtu word for \"face-saving formula.\" Officials never found a way to ease the Taliban's fear of embarrassment if it turned over a fellow Muslim to an \"infidel\" Western power. \"We were not serious about the whole thing, not only this administration but the previous one,\" said Richard Hrair Dekmejian, an expert in Islamic fundamentalism and author at the University of Southern California. \"We did not engage these people creatively. There were missed opportunities.\" U.S. officials struggled to communicate with Muslim clerics unfamiliar with modern diplomacy and distrustful of the Western world, and they failed to take advantage of fractures in", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:011029post.txt:0:891567078dd6", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 6881, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "011029post.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "011029post", "chunk_index": 1, "text": "over a fellow Muslim to an \"infidel\" Western power. \"We were not serious about the whole thing, not only this administration but the previous one,\" said Richard Hrair Dekmejian, an expert in Islamic fundamentalism and author at the University of Southern California. \"We did not engage these people creatively. There were missed opportunities.\" U.S. officials struggled to communicate with Muslim clerics unfamiliar with modern diplomacy and distrustful of the Western world, and they failed to take advantage of fractures in the Taliban leadership. \"We never heard what they were trying to say,\" said Milton Bearden, a former CIA station chief who oversaw U.S. covert operations in Afghanistan in the 1980s. \"We had no common language. Ours was, 'Give up bin Laden.' They were saying, 'Do something to help us give him up.' \" State Department officials assert that despite hours of talks and proposals that were infuriatingly vague, the Afghan rulers never truly intended to give up bin Laden. U.S. negotiators started out \"very, very patient,\" one official said. But over the course of many meetings, the envoys \"lost all patience with them because they kept saying they would do something and they did exactly nothing.\" The meetings took place in Tashkent, Kandahar, Islamabad, Bonn, New York and Washington. There were surprise satellite calls, one of which led to a 40-minute chat between a mid-level State Department bureaucrat and the Taliban's supreme leader, Mohammad Omar. There was a surprise visit to Washington, made by a Taliban envoy bearing a gift carpet for Bush. The diplomatic effort to snare bin Laden began as early as 1996, when officials devised a plan to use back channels to Sudan, one of seven countries on the U.S. list of terrorist-supporting states. Under the plan, bin Laden would be arrested in Khartoum and extradited to Saudi Arabia, which would turn him over to the United States. But the United States could not persuade the Saudis to accept bin Laden, and Sudan instead expelled him to Afghanistan in May 1996 -- a few months before the Taliban seized power in Kabul. The Clinton administration did not begin seriously pressing the Taliban for bin Laden's expulsion until the August 1998 bombings of U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania that killed 224 people, including 12 Americans, and injured 4,600. The bombings were \"a seminal moment,\" changing Washington's view of the Taliban, an administration official said. The attacks convinced U.S. policymakers that Omar was no longer simply interested in conquering Afghanistan, but that his protection was allowing bin Laden, a longtime friend, to engage in terrorist ventures abroad. U.S. officials launched a two-pronged policy to pressure the Taliban into handing over bin Laden. On the one hand, the United States used the United Nations and the threat of sanctions. On the other, it began a hard-nosed dialogue. Within days of the embassy bombings, State Department officer Michael Malinowski began", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:011029post.txt:1:1b7c5d94200d", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 6882, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "011029post.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "011029post", "chunk_index": 2, "text": "U.S. policymakers that Omar was no longer simply interested in conquering Afghanistan, but that his protection was allowing bin Laden, a longtime friend, to engage in terrorist ventures abroad. U.S. officials launched a two-pronged policy to pressure the Taliban into handing over bin Laden. On the one hand, the United States used the United Nations and the threat of sanctions. On the other, it began a hard-nosed dialogue. Within days of the embassy bombings, State Department officer Michael Malinowski began telephoning Taliban officials. On one occasion, Malinowski, lounging on the deck of his Washington home, spoke by telephone with Omar. \"I would say, 'Hey, give up bin Laden,' and they would say, 'No. . . . Show us the evidence,' \" Malinowski said. Taliban leaders argued they could not expel a guest, and Malinowski responded, \"It is not all right if this visitor goes up to the roof of your house and shoots his gun at his neighbors.\" On Feb. 3, 1999, U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Karl E. Inderfurth, the Clinton administration's point man for talks with the Taliban, and Michael Sheehan, State Department counterterrorism chief, went to Islamabad to deliver a stern message to the Taliban's deputy foreign minister, Abdul Jalil: The United States henceforth would hold the Taliban responsible for any terrorist act by bin Laden. By that time, bin Laden had been indicted for his alleged role in the embassy bombings. The officials reviewed the indictment in detail with the Taliban and offered to provide more evidence if the Taliban sent a delegation to New York. The Taliban did not do so. Immediately after the U.S. warning, Taliban security forces took bin Laden from his Kandahar compound and spirited him away to a remote site, according to media reports at the time. They also seized his satellite communications and barred him from contact with the media. Publicly, the Taliban said they no longer knew where he was. Inderfurth now says the United States interpreted such statements \"as an effort to evade their responsibility to turn him over.\" Others, however, say the cryptic statements should have been interpreted differently. Bearden, for example, believes the Taliban more than once set up bin Laden for capture by the United States and communicated its intent by saying he was lost. \"Every time the Afghans said, 'He's lost again,' they are saying something. They are saying, 'He's no longer under our protection,' \" Bearden said. \"They thought they were signaling us subtly, and we don't do signals.\" U.N. pressure steadily mounted. In October 1999, a Security Council resolution demanded the Taliban turn over bin Laden to \"appropriate authorities\" but left open the possibility he could be tried somewhere besides a U.S. court. In response, the Taliban proposed bringing bin Laden to justice, either in Afghanistan or another Muslim country.

In October 1999, a Security Council resolution demanded the Taliban turn over bin Laden to \"appropriate authorities\" but left open the possibility he could be tried somewhere besides a U.S. court. In response, the Taliban proposed bringing bin Laden to justice, either in Afghanistan or another Muslim country. One Taliban proposal suggested bin Laden be turned over to a panel of three Islamic jurists, one each chosen by Afghanistan, Saudi Arabia and the United States. When the United States rejected that proposal, the Taliban countered that it would settle for only one Islamic jurist on such a panel, a source close to the Taliban leadership said. Taliban leaders also kept demanding the United States provide more evidence of bin Laden's terrorist activities. \"It became clear that the call for more evidence was more a delaying tactic than a sincere effort to solve the bin Laden issue,\" Inderfurth said. Throughout 1999 and 2000, Inderfurth, Sheehan and Thomas R. Pickering, then undersecretary of state, continued meeting in Washington, Islamabad, New York and Bonn to review evidence against bin Laden. They warned of war if there were another terrorist attack. \"We saw a continuing effort to evade, deny and obfuscate,\" Inderfurth said. \"They had no interest in an international panel, really. Their only intention was not to hand bin Laden over.\" Phyllis E. Oakley, head of the State Department's intelligence bureau in the late 1990s, said her bureau concluded Omar would never give up bin Laden. Last March, Rahmatullah Hashimi, a 24-year-old Taliban envoy, arrived in Washington on a surprise visit, meeting with reporters, middle-ranking State Department bureaucrats and private Afghanistan experts. He carried a gift carpet and a letter from Omar, both meant for President Bush. Hashimi said he had come with a new offer, but U.S. officials now dismiss his visit as just another feint. They say Hashimi simply wanted to know whether the new administration had a fresh idea for breaking the deadlock. Yet the two sides kept meeting, mostly in Islamabad. Assistant Secretary of State Christina Rocca saw Taliban ambassador Abdul Salam Zaeef there in early August, and U.S. embassy officials held secret talks with Taliban security chief Hameed Rasoli. The Taliban invited a U.S. delegation to Kandahar, but the United States refused unless a solution for handing over bin Laden was first reached, a source close to the Taliban said. Even after Sept. 11, as U.S. aircraft carriers and warplanes rushed toward Afghanistan, the Taliban's mysterious maneuvering continued. Bearden, the former CIA administrator, picked up his phone in Reston in early October and dialed a satellite number in Kandahar. Hashimi answered, still full of optimism that Saudi clerics and an upcoming conference of Islamic nations would give their blessing to Bush's demand that they \"cough him up.\" \"There", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:011029post.txt:3:824f8cb32e2d", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 6884, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "011029post.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "011029post", "chunk_index": 4, "text": "bin Laden was first reached, a source close to the Taliban said.

He was a pain in the neck,\" Bearden said of bin Laden. \"It never clicked.\" Staff writers Gilbert M. Gaul, Mary Pat Flaherty and James V.

Needing urgent treatment for his ailing kidneys, bin Laden, 44, is said to have checked into the American Hospital in Dubai in July. Among those with him, it is thought, was Dr Ayman Zawahiri, who as well as being his personal physician is al-Qaeda's second-in-command. The report in Le Figaro and on Radio France International said that bin Laden had stayed in hospital for ten days. There have been persistent rumours about the frailty of bin Laden's health. In recent videos he is generally not seen moving about. When he does take a few steps it is with the aid of a cane. Aides blame a back injury. Intelligence sources believe that bin Laden bought a dialysis machine earlier this year which he had shipped to Kandahar. His problem now will be operating such equipment and the risk of infection if, as seems likely, he is hiding out in Afghan mountains. Last year the magazine Asiaweek said bin Laden was dying of a kidney disease. In desperation he is said to have turned to the United Arab Emirates, one of the three governments that recognised the Taleban regime. Bin Laden is known to have influential supporters in the Emirates and to have kept substantial funds in bank accounts there. He is believed to have flown out of Dubai on the morning of the September 11 hijackings. According to Western diplomatic sources the UAE was the nearest safe destination for bin Laden to get the high quality, modern and urgent treatment he needed.

According to Western diplomatic sources the UAE was the nearest safe destination for bin Laden to get the high quality, modern and urgent treatment he needed. Quoting an unnamed manager at the American Hospital, Le Figaro said that bin Laden arrived in Dubai on July 4 accompanied by four bodyguards, an Algerian male nurse and Dr Zawahiri, who stayed at his side at all times. They had flown to Dubai from Quetta in Pakistan. The newspaper said that **bin Laden was treated in the urology department, run by Terry Callaway, a Canadian-trained doctor**, and left on July 14. Dr Callaway is a specialist in kidney stones and male infertility. **During his stay, Le Figaro said, bin Laden was visited by a CIA agent. One source said that the US agent was \"recognised taking the main lift in the hospital to go to Osama bin Laden's room\". The agent was recalled to the US on July 15, the day after bin Laden left hospital, the newspaper said. The CIA last night flatly denied the report. Its spokeswoman, Anya Guelsher, said that it was \"complete nonsense\". ** A diplomatic source said earlier: \"There are lots of rumours flying around Dubai. At first sight, it seems highly unlikely that a member of the CIA would go and knock on bin Laden's hospital bedroom door.\" Bernard Koval, the director of the 100-bed hospital that opened in 1995, also denied that bin Laden had been a patient there. Dr Callaway was unavailable for comment. Intelligence sources in France also questioned yesterday what US agents did with information that Paris passed to America about bin Laden's terrorist ambitions just a few days before September 11. One of his lieutenants, Djamel Beghal, a French-Algerian, who had been arrested in Dubai on his way back from Afghanistan to Europe, allegedly told police that he had been told by al-Qaeda to plan a terrorist attack on the US Embassy in Paris. Le Figaro said that on September 7 the French intelligence service met embassy officials in Paris to pass on the information. © 2001 London Times FAIR USE NOTICE: This site contains copyrighted material the use of which has not always been specifically authorized by the copyright owner.

The CIA has dismissed as \"total absurdity\" a report carried Wednesday by Radio France and by France's Le Figaro newspaper, alleging that a CIA agent met with bin Laden at a Dubai clinic, where the suspected terrorist was reportedly treated for kidney problems. The clinic, said to be the American Hospital in Dubai, also denied bin Laden had been a patient. The American Embassy in Paris has not commented on the report. The Paris-based International Herald Tribune suggested the erroneous information may have been leaked by opponents in France to the U.S. military campaign in Afghanistan. \"Disinformation may have been planted ... to suggest a continuing covert linkage between the CIA and bin Laden,\" a French intelligence source told the Herald Tribune. Nonetheless, Radio France International, for one, said it stood by its report. In a follow-up Thursday, the French radio station identified the alleged CIA agent as Larry Mitchell, \"a connoisseur of the Arab world and specialist of the (Arab) peninsula.\" Mitchell's business card identified him as a \"consular agent,\" the radio said. In fact, RFI alleged, he was a CIA agent and a prominent fixture in Dubai's expatriate community. According to both the radio and Le Figaro, Mitchell was recalled to the CIA's headquarters in McLean, Va., on July 15. The radio also gave the precise date of Mitchell's supposed encounter with bin Laden -- July 12, two days before the Saudi dissident reportedly checked out of the hospital. Neither the Figaro, nor Radio France offered independent confirmation of the report. The radio station also cited no source for its latest allegations. Earlier, the Figaro said its story was leaked by a partner of the hospital's management. In an interview published Thursday in Le Figaro, Arab specialist Antoine Sfeir said he was not surprised on the alleged CIA-bin Laden ties. \"Bin Laden maintained contacts with bin Laden until 1998,\" Sfeir said. \"Those contacts didn't end after bin Laden moved to Afghanistan. Until the last minute, CIA agents hoped bin Laden would return to U.S. command, as was the case before", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:011101upi.txt:0:40e828c329fc", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 6890, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "011101upi.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "011101upi", "chunk_index": 1, "text": "latest allegations.

Missteps Hampering Anthrax Inquiry This article was reported and written by William J. Broad, David Johnston, Judith Miller and Paul Zielbauer. (NYT) 3123 words The federal inquiry into the anthrax attacks has stumbled in several areas and may have missed opportunities to gather valuable evidence as criminal investigators have been unable to fully grasp the scientific complexities of the case. Government officials, scientists and investigators said the Federal Bureau of Investigation's initial unfamiliarity with the intricacies of anthrax had contributed to a series of missteps and other possible errors. The F.B.I. came under withering criticism this week in Congress for the lack of progress in the investigation, and bureau officials acknowledged in interviews that they had been forced to turn to outside experts for advice on how to investigate the most serious bioterrorism attack in the nation's history. But they said the inquiry was following a logical strategy. In a plan announced yesterday by Attorney General John Ashcroft, the bureau, and other parts of the Justice Department, would be revamped to better prevent terror attacks, and the government would use new powers to tap lawyer-client conversations with defendants in terrorist cases. [Page B1.] Several experts, including some on whom the F.B.I. has relied, said the anthrax investigation had taken some wrong turns. **Shortly after the first case of anthrax arose, the F.B.I. said it had no objection to the destruction of a collection of anthrax samples at Iowa State University, but some scientists involved in the investigation now say that collection may have contained genetic clues valuable to the inquiry. ** **Criminal investigators have not visited many of the companies, laboratories and academic institutions with the equipment or capability to make the kind of highly potent anthrax sent in", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:011109nytimes.txt:0:f5c0cec111e4", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 6892, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "011109nytimes.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "011109nytimes", "chunk_index": 1, "text": "some wrong turns. **Shortly after the first case of anthrax arose, the F.B.I. said it had no objection to the destruction of a collection of anthrax samples at Iowa State University, but some scientists involved in the investigation now say that collection may have contained genetic clues valuable to the inquiry. ** **Criminal investigators have not visited many of the companies, laboratories and academic institutions with the equipment or capability to make the kind of highly potent anthrax sent in a letter to Senator Tom Daschle, the majority leader. Where investigators have conducted interviews, they often seemed to ask general questions unlikely to elicit new evidence, several laboratory directors said. ** Just this week, more than a month after the first death from inhalation anthrax, the F.B.I. issued a subpoena asking laboratories for the names of all workers and researchers who had been vaccinated against anthrax. And the F.B.I. is only now establishing electronic bulletin boards to allow members of scientific groups to interact with criminal investigators working the case. ''The bureau was caught almost as unaware and unprepared as the public was for these events,'' said Bill Tobin, a former forensic metallurgist who worked for the F.B.I. crime laboratory in Washington. ''It's just unrealistic to ask 7,000 agents to overnight become sufficiently knowledgeable about bioterrorist agents and possible means of theft of those items and how they might be disseminated lethally to an American populace.'' There is no reason to believe that any of the investigators' actions contributed to their inability to identify clear leads in the anthrax attacks that have killed four people and led to the treatment of thousands of others. John Collingwood, the F.B.I.'s spokesman, said last night: ''We have a plan and are proceeding based in large part on what the people we are consulting with told us would be the most productive places to begin. We reached out to scientists and public health officials on the best way to proceed.'' Asked about the course of the bureau's investigation, a senior F.B.I. official who spoke on condition of anonymity said: ''This is a learning curve for everybody. Every single day, if not hourly, we're all learning something about this. If you take several weeks back, the learning curve, we were all behind it.'' Evidence Disappears **Last month, after consulting with the F.B.I., Iowa State University in Ames destroyed anthrax spores collected over more than seven decades and kept in more than 100 vials.** **A variant of the so-called Ames strain had been implicated in the death of a Florida man from inhalation anthrax, and the university was nervous about security. ** **Now, a dispute has arisen, with scientists in and out of government saying the rush to destroy the spores may have eliminated crucial evidence about the anthrax in the letters sent to Congress and the news media. ** If the archive still existed, it", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:011109nytimes.txt:1:56e853e5cdea", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 6893, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "011109nytimes.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "011109nytimes", "chunk_index": 2, "text": "decades and kept in more than 100 vials.** **A variant of the so-called Ames strain had been implicated in the death of a Florida man from inhalation anthrax, and the university was nervous about security. ** **Now, a dispute has arisen, with scientists in and out of government saying the rush to destroy the spores may have eliminated crucial evidence about the anthrax in the letters sent to Congress and the news media. ** If the archive still existed, it would by no means solve the mystery. But scientists said a precise match between the anthrax that killed four people and a particular strain in the collection might have offered hints as to when that bacteria had been isolated and, perhaps, how widely it had been distributed to researchers. And that, in turn, might have given investigators important clues to the killer's identity. Martin E. Hugh-Jones, an anthrax expert at Louisiana State University who is aiding the federal investigation, said the mystery is likely to persist. ''If those cultures were still alive,'' he said, they could have helped in ''clearing up the muddy history.'' Ronald M. Atlas, president-elect of the American Society of Microbiology, the world's largest group of germ professionals, based in Washington, said the legal implications could be large. ''Potentially,'' he said, ''it loses evidence that would have been useful'' in the criminal investigation. The F.B.I. says it never explicitly approved the destruction of the cultures, but never objected either. A law enforcement official said that when approached by the Ames laboratory about the destruction of its anthrax inventory, the Omaha F.B.I. office consulted with the Miami F.B.I. office, which was responsible for the initial anthrax case in Florida. He said Miami investigators, after consulting with scientists, had advised the Omaha office that the Ames strain was so widespread that it had no investigative or evidentiary value. ''Based on that there were no objections,'' to the destruction of the material by the Iowa laboratory, the official said. Several experts said the episode underscored how the bureau traditionally has had trouble understanding the language, and the demands, of science. ''There's a chasm between what's going on in the courtroom and forensic arena,'' said Mr. Tobin, the former F.B.I. scientist, who has criticized the bureau's investigative methods. The flow of scientific data, he said, ''just doesn't seem to make it'' into criminal investigations. And a senior federal scientist familiar with the germ investigation added: ''You're still dealing with the mentality that says anthrax is anthrax is anthrax, and doesn't realize that there are deeper signatures.'' Intertwined with the mystery of the Ames strain's history is the question of whether it was used in America's abandoned effort to develop anthrax as a weapon from 1943 to 1969, when President Richard M. Nixon renounced germ warfare. The scientific literature is contradictory.

Intertwined with the mystery of the Ames strain's history is the question of whether it was used in America's abandoned effort to develop anthrax as a weapon from 1943 to 1969, when President Richard M. Nixon renounced germ warfare. The scientific literature is contradictory. A 1986 paper by Army researchers said the strain did not arise until 1980. But a paper in 2000 by Dr. Hugh-Jones, Paul J. Jackson of the Los Alamos National Laboratory, Paul Keim of Northern Arizona University and five other anthrax researchers asserted that the Ames strain had played a central role in the biological warfare program in the United States. If true, that could raise the question of whether the perpetrators of the current crimes had learned of the American recipe or even found and exploited lost anthrax stockpiles. Caree Vander Linden, spokeswoman for the Army's germ defense laboratory at Fort Detrick, Md., said officials there had not investigated whether the Ames strain was used in the old weapons program. The Iowa State archive was destroyed on Oct. 10 and 11, after relatively brief deliberations with the F.B.I., said Julie Johnson, an official in environmental and safety at Iowa State. It is unclear if the F.B.I. understood that Iowa State had destroyed many strains of anthrax or that the origins of the Ames strain were cloudy. Larry Holmquist, a spokesman for the F.B.I. in Omaha, which runs the bureau's Iowa operations, said the rationale for the destruction was that the strain had been ''sent out to numerous places'' around the globe in the past ''40 or 50 years.'' Tom Ridge, the White House director of homeland security, confirmed publicly that the tainted letters contained the Ames strain on Oct. 25, two weeks after the destruction. **Iowa State says it won destruction approval not only from the F.B.I. but also from the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which are involved in the federal investigation. ** James A. Roth, a microbiologist at the College of Veterinary Medicine who presided over the destruction, said the university's records on its anthrax strains were extremely limited and that the labeling on the vials themselves was often cryptic, leaving officials unsure exactly how many strains the university had. Even so, ''we think they had all the strains already,'' he said of the F.B.I. and the C.D.C. The oldest strain in the collection dated to 1928. If the Ames strain was similarly old, experts said, it is conceivable that the potent germs were distributed far more widely than conventional wisdom holds. Since the destruction, Dr. Roth said, the university has heard nothing from the bureau about anthrax. As for whether the destroyed strains might have clarified the origins of Ames, he said, ''now we'll never", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:011109nytimes.txt:3:d2a966ff0c36", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 6895, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "011109nytimes.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "011109nytimes", "chunk_index": 4, "text": "all the strains already,'' he said of the F.B.I. and the C.D.C.

As for whether the destroyed strains might have clarified the origins of Ames, he said, ''now we'll never know.'' Questioning Scientists The F.B.I. has been pressing its investigation in New Jersey, where the letters originated. When two men from the F.B.I. and the New Jersey State Police arrived last month at the Waksman Institute of Microbiology at Rutgers University in New Jersey, scientists there saw it as a natural step in the anthrax investigation. Staffed with microbiologists familiar with how the deadly bacteria grow and filled with the sophisticated laboratory equipment involved, the institute, just 38 miles from the Trenton post offices where the letters were postmarked, was a natural place for investigators to ask detailed questions. But the two investigators, escorted by the university's head of security, asked the laboratory's director, Dr. Joachim Messing, only a few general questions about growing bacteria and never mentioned specifically what they were looking for. Finally, Dr. Messing said, he felt obligated to volunteer that his laboratory did not handle anthrax. ''I couldn't give you a clue what they were after,'' Dr. Messing said in an interview this week. ''I asked the person from the F.B.I. if he knows anything about bacteria, some very simple questions, and it was very clear that he didn't have the background to make evaluations.'' Tracking the F.B.I.'s investigation near Trenton, and beyond, shows that agents seemed to have passed over some potential opportunities for developing leads. Though investigators are consulting some members of professional organizations like the American Society for Microbiology and the American College of Veterinary Microbiologists, the F.B.I. is only now establishing an Internet bulletin board to permit members of those groups to pass information to the bureau's leadership, a senior F.B.I. official said. ''That's in the works,'' he said. Top bureau officials also appeared to be unaware of last month's international chemical and pharmaceutical convention, ChemShow, in New York City, which attracted hundreds of chemical and pharmaceutical equipment manufacturers, engineers and technicians. ''If they weren't crawling around that show, they should have been,'' said Richard Barbini, a chemical engineer and salesman for Arde Barinco Inc., in Norwood, N.J., a pharmaceutical equipment maker. ''There's all kinds of people there from many different countries, a lot of people who know a lot'' about what it takes to make anthrax. The senior F.B.I. official said he was not sure if any agents had attended the show, and a bureau spokeswoman said the agency would not comment on the matter. In New Jersey, the F.B.I. has", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:011109nytimes.txt:4:9e6653ac4689", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 6896, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "011109nytimes.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "011109nytimes", "chunk_index": 5, "text": "been,'' said Richard Barbini, a chemical engineer and salesman for Arde Barinco Inc., in Norwood, N.J., a pharmaceutical equipment maker. ''There's all kinds of people there from many different countries, a lot of people who know a lot'' about what it takes to make anthrax. The senior F.B.I. official said he was not sure if any agents had attended the show, and a bureau spokeswoman said the agency would not comment on the matter. In New Jersey, the F.B.I. has been in regular contact with the University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey in Newark, which works with infectious bacteria, but special agents have yet to call bacteria experts at the university's Robert Wood Johnson Medical School in Piscataway, said Michael A. Gallo, a professor of environmental community medicine. F.B.I. officials say that their investigation is proceeding methodically in an uncharted area and that questions will eventually be asked in all appropriate places. Several microbiologists suggested that agents should focus on companies that sell new and used laboratory equipment that could reduce anthrax to the micron-size particles found in the letter sent to Mr. Daschle's office last month. That equipment would include either a jet mill or a spray dryer, each of which can be used to reduce bacteria into ultrafine, inhalable powder. Some companies that deal in that equipment said F.B.I. agents had called seeking detailed information, while others said they had been asked only general questions. Others said they had not been called at all. A sales official at Spray Drying Systems Inc., of Randallstown, Md., a company that sells spray dryers, said the company had not heard from investigators. But agents from the Boston F.B.I. office visited some companies, including Sturtevant Inc. in Hanover, Mass., which manufactures jet mills, said a company executive who asked that his name not be used. ''He was asking very good questions,'' the executive said of the agent. Eventually, the executive said, he gave the agent lists of his customers and competitors. ''There's dozens and dozens and dozens of used equipment dealers out there,'' he said. ''Even the F.B.I. doesn't have enough people to track down the number of machines that are in commerce in the world.'' Though they are still compiling a complete list of places anthrax is stored in this country, federal investigators have already visited a number of laboratories, germ warehouses, universities, government agencies and even veterinarians in their search for clues in the anthrax attacks, one federal investigator involved in the inquiry said. So far, he said, a range of government agencies that maintain anthrax, including the National Institutes of Health and the Food and Drug Administration, have been asked to account for their specimens in detail, and to provide samples to compare with those used in the bioterror attacks. In addition, organizations like the New Jersey Veterinary Medical Association and the New Jersey Pharmacists Association, which", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:011109nytimes.txt:5:76ac2b057df2", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 6897, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "011109nytimes.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "011109nytimes", "chunk_index": 6, "text": "their search for clues in the anthrax attacks, one federal investigator involved in the inquiry said.

In addition, organizations like the New Jersey Veterinary Medical Association and the New Jersey Pharmacists Association, which has set up a hotline to the F.B.I. to report large orders for anthrax vaccines, said that at least one of their members had been contacted by the F.B.I. And at the American Type Culture Collection, a vast bioresource center that sells germs, based in Virginia, Nancy Wysocki, a vice president, said the center had ''a very close working relationship with many of the federal agencies, including the F.B.I.'' F.B.I. agents have also spoken to some pharmaceutical companies, including some based in New Jersey, company executives said. Some have been open with the bureau, others have asked, for legal reasons, for agents to present a subpoena before they would grant access to their files. ''We want to know what you have for anthrax, we want to see the documentation, we want to know who has access to it, where it's shipped from, who works with it, we want to know the protocols,'' said a senior F.B.I. official. ''We're not going to leave these facilities until every question is answered.'' Many university laboratories in New Jersey, Pennsylvania and New York have not been contacted in the investigation. ''I haven't seen neither hide nor hair of them,'' said Dr. John E. Lennox, a professor at Penn State University's microbiology department, though anyone interested in producing anthrax could find what they need in his laboratory. ''There isn't anything they would require that isn't in my lab,'' he said. But Dr. Sulie Chang, chairwoman of the biology department at Seton Hall University in New Jersey, said F.B.I. agents called her several weeks ago, saying that they were contacting biology departments throughout the state. Dr. Chang said they wanted to know if any students had shown a sudden interest in anthrax. In fact, she said, a student there had given a 15-minute presentation on the topic recently and she gave the agents his name. She said she did not know whether they followed up. Dispute Over Daschle Letter The F.B.I. was confronted with differing assessments of the anthrax found in the letter to Senator Daschle, a dispute among experts that illustrates the government's slowly evolving understanding of how to investigate an anthrax attack. An initial analysis by the United States Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases, which specializes in biodefense, found that the material was very pure, very concentrated and highly dangerous.

An initial analysis by the United States Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases, which specializes in biodefense, found that the material was very pure, very concentrated and highly dangerous. The Fort Detrick laboratory began studying the Daschle letter on Oct. 15 and delivered its first assessment to the bureau that night, a spokesman said. Two days later, the F.B.I. sent a sample for additional testing to Battelle, a military contractor in Ohio that does secret work for the Pentagon and other government agencies. Officials said the Army laboratory had irradiated part of the anthrax spores before studying them, a safety technique that leaves their aerodynamic and other characteristics undisturbed. Apparently unaware that the Army laboratory had irradiated the material, Battelle used a different method, officials said, placing the anthrax in an autoclave and killing the spores with intense pressure and steam. Two officials said that this produced a far lower estimate of the concentration level and prompted Battelle scientists to conclude that the material was more likely to clump together, and thus less likely to waft through the air, than the Army scientists had estimated. Both laboratories delivered reports to the F.B.I. on Oct. 22. One administration official said Fort Detrick found that the Daschle anthrax contained as much as one trillion spores per gram, much more than had been detected by Battelle. Scientists quickly recognized that the tests had been conducted differently and agreed that Battelle should do a second study using irradiated material. A shipment was sent to Battelle on Oct. 25, one official said, which subsequently produced estimates similar to those of the Army scientists. While the different findings created intense controversy in scientific circles, senior law enforcement officials said they had had virtually no effect on their conclusion that the material was very dangerous or on what they had told senior officials. But officials said senior officials at the Department of Health and Human Services were sufficiently curious about the disagreement that they had asked the Army scientists to discuss their findings in person on Oct. 23. Officials said this week that the incident reflected how unaccustomed the bureau was to managing a complicated investigation that turned on scientific analysis.

Pasechnik, 64, Is Dead; Germ Expert Who Defected By WOLFGANG SAXON ( Obituary (Obit); Biography ) 660 words Dr. Vladimir Pasechnik, a senior Soviet biologist whose defection in 1989 alerted Western intelligence to the scope of Moscow's clandestine efforts to adapt germs and viruses for military use, died on Wednesday in Wiltshire, England. He was 64 and lived in a nearby village. The cause was a stroke, said Dr. Christopher J. Davis of Great Falls, Va., formerly in British intelligence. It was Dr. Pasechnik who provided a first glimpse of Biopreparat, a network of secret laboratories, each focused on a deadly agent. His revelations were confirmed in 1992 with the defection to the United States of Dr. Ken Alibek, the No. 2 scientist for the program. The picture that emerged was of a system of centers scattered chiefly around European Russia. There, a small army of scientists and technicians were developing potential biological weapons like anthrax, Ebola, Marburg virus, plague, Q fever and smallpox. Dr. Pasechnik was in charge of one known as the Institute of Ultra Pure Biochemical Preparations in St. Petersburg, then Leningrad. Once in England, he told interviewers that he had no inkling that his work violated the 1972 treaty under which the United States and the Soviet Union were to halt such activities. Once revealed, the Soviet government insisted that the research was intended to defend against acts of biological warfare by an enemy and that the program had been stopped, two claims doubted by Western intelligence. Dr. Pasechnik defected on an official trip to the West, but little was known about his background until early 1993 when the British government permitted him to speak. He said he had become ''disgusted'' with the biological weapons program, which had been denied by Presidents Mikhail S. Gorbachev and Boris N. Yeltsin, or had been hidden from them. Dr. Pasechnik said he defected in an effort to help stop it. (His own laboratory had been working on a strain of plague.) James Adams, in his", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:011123nytimes.txt:0:7283162380ee", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 6901, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "011123nytimes.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "011123nytimes", "chunk_index": 1, "text": "official trip to the West, but little was known about his background until early 1993 when the British government permitted him to speak.

Dr. Pasechnik said he defected in an effort to help stop it. (His own laboratory had been working on a strain of plague.) James Adams, in his 1994 book ''The New Spies,'' described Dr. Pasechnik as ''one of the brightest stars at the Leningrad Polytechnical Institute.'' A native of Volgograd, formerly Stalingrad, he graduated in physics at the top of his class. He specialized in the study of polymers for biological uses at the Institute of High Molecular Compounds in St. Petersburg. His interest, Mr. Adams wrote, was in developing new antibiotics and methods to treat diseases without known cures. At age 37, Dr. Pasechnik was invited to start his own institute, Mr. Adams wrote, with an unlimited budget to buy equipment in the West and recruit the best staff available. The laboratory he created was part of the countrywide Biopreparat. He later reported that the institute, with a staff of 400, did research on modifying cruise missiles to spread germs. Flying low to foil early-warning systems, the robot craft were intended to spray clouds of aerosolized pathogens over unsuspecting enemies. Dr. Pasechnik said his team succeeded in producing an aerosolized plague microbe that could survive outside the laboratory. Increasingly distressed, Dr. Pasechnik had begun to plan his defection in 1988, he but had never been permitted to travel abroad, Mr. Adams wrote. Meanwhile, Western intelligence agencies had been poring over bits and pieces of information for years, trying to assess the state of Soviet efforts in his field. Dr. Pasechnik got his chance to travel in the summer of 1989. He volunteered to wrap up a pending deal with a French maker of chemical laboratory equipment. In recognition of past performance, he was allowed to travel to Toulouse to sign the contracts. Instead, he called the British Embassy in Paris.

Security Council Resolution on the Taliban (Sanctions seek to avoid harm to Afghan people) Fact Sheet: Questions and Answers About the New UNSC Resolution Targeted at the Taliban QUESTION: What sanctions against the Taliban are proposed in the new United Nations Security Council resolution? ANSWER: Because the Taliban have ignored their obligations under UNSC Resolution 1267 (1999) and have continued to threaten international peace and security, the new resolution calls for the Security Council to: Demand the Taliban comply with Resolution 1267 and cease providing training and support of international terrorists; Insist the Taliban turn over indicted international terrorist Usama bin Laden so he can be brought to justice; Direct the Taliban to close all terrorist camps in Afghanistan within 30 days. Until the Taliban fully comply with their obligations under this resolution and resolution 1267, the Security Council will: Freeze the financial assets of Usama bin Laden; Impose an arms embargo against the Taliban that includes, a prohibition on providing military weapons, training, or advice; Close all Taliban offices overseas; Urge Member States to reduce the staff at the limited number of Taliban missions abroad; Advise Member States to restrict travel of top Taliban officials except for the purposes of participation in peace negotiations, compliance with the resolution, or for humanitarian reasons, including religious obligations; Ban the export to Afghan territory of a precursor chemical, acetic anhydride, which is used to manufacture heroin; Close all offices of Ariana Afghan Airlines and ban all non-humanitarian assistance flights into and out of Afghanistan. Broad exemptions are given to humanitarian flights operated by, or on behalf of, non-governmental organizations and governmental relief agencies proving humanitarian assistance to Afghanistan. QUESTION: The United States was always a good friend of Afghanistan, especially during the Soviet-Afghan War in the 1980s. Why has the United States turned against Afghanistan? ANSWER: This resolution is not against Afghanistan. It is certainly not against the Afghan people. It is narrowly targeted at the Taliban leadership. The United States opposes the dangerous and destructive policies of the Taliban, but the United States has not \"turned against Afghanistan.\" United States policy and the sanctions imposed against the Taliban by the international community are in no way intended to harm the Afghan people. The United States remains deeply concerned about the suffering of the Afghan people. During 2000, the United States has", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:011211statedept.txt:0:0d287916c6bc", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 6904, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "011211statedept.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "011211statedept", "chunk_index": 1, "text": "It is certainly not against the Afghan people. It is narrowly targeted at the Taliban leadership. The United States opposes the dangerous and destructive policies of the Taliban, but the United States has not \"turned against Afghanistan.\" United States policy and the sanctions imposed against the Taliban by the international community are in no way intended to harm the Afghan people. The United States remains deeply concerned about the suffering of the Afghan people. During 2000, the United States has provided the Afghan people about $113 million in humanitarian assistance, through international agencies and nongovernmental organizations. These funds provided food, shelter, land mine clearance, sanitation, and emergency drought relief. The Taliban, on the other hand, have failed to adequately address the needs of the Afghan people while at the same time spending vast sums on military arms and equipment to pursue a military option that will never bring lasting peace to Afghanistan. QUESTION: In addition to the devastating effects of two decades of war, Afghans are suffering the worst drought in a generation. Won't this new resolution simply impose further suffering on the Afghan people? ANSWER: No, it will not. We have carefully examined the humanitarian impact of UNSCR 1267, which has been in place for one year, and have found no significant humanitarian disruptions for the people of Afghanistan. We have studied the potential humanitarian impact of the sanctions in the new resolution and, again, have concluded that the humanitarian impact would be minimal. If, in fact, there is a negative impact on the delivery of humanitarian assistance, we believe that the Taliban will cause it by rousing anger among the population against the United Nations and non-governmental organization that provide humanitarian assistance in Afghanistan. The new UNSC resolution is targeted at the Taliban leadership, not at the Afghan people. International agencies and nongovernmental organizations provide crucial food, medical, and other assistance to the people of Afghanistan. For the sake of the Afghan people especially vulnerable women and children the humanitarian-aid providers need to keep working. They will stop only if the Taliban cause them to stop. The international community holds the Taliban responsible for providing adequate security to these humanitarian relief workers, and calls on the Taliban leadership to stop their inflammatory disinformation campaign that the United Nations and the international community seek to harm the people of Afghanistan with sanctions. This is a cynical and calculated lie on the part of the Taliban. This Taliban disinformation could lead to violence against aid providers. If the Taliban create a situation that causes humanitarian international organizations to evacuate their personnel from Afghanistan, we believe that the Afghan people themselves will hold the Taliban responsible for such a negative development. QUESTION: Some leaders of humanitarian organizations have recently told reporters that sanctions harm the ordinary people of Afghanistan. Should we not take their views into account? ANSWER: We do respect", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:011211statedept.txt:1:676fb59b1218", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 6905, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "011211statedept.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "011211statedept", "chunk_index": 2, "text": "on the part of the Taliban.

QUESTION: Some leaders of humanitarian organizations have recently told reporters that sanctions harm the ordinary people of Afghanistan. Should we not take their views into account? ANSWER: We do respect their views. But we also believe it is important to understand that we will hold the Taliban responsible for any negative developments on the humanitarian front. Further, we believe it is important to understand how the Taliban are orchestrating their disinformation campaign and that there are facts, some from the Taliban themselves, that contradict their lies. We repeat that the international community has no dispute with the people of Afghanistan and is keenly aware of their suffering. For this reason, the sanctions in both resolutions have been carefully written to ensure that they have a minimum impact on the Afghan people as opposed to the Taliban leadership. Neither resolution prohibits trade and commerce by the private sector, including the private-sector import of food and medicine. Neither resolution prohibits humanitarian assistance to Afghanistan. Neither resolution prohibits Afghans from traveling for urgent humanitarian reasons or to fulfill their religious obligations such as hajj, including on Ariana Afghan Airline flights which the UN Sanctions Committee has the authority to approve. Furthermore, the new resolution does not prevent ordinary Afghans from traveling for any reason. Soon after UNSCR 1267 came into effect in December 1999, the official Taliban media complained that the Afghan people would suffer because all mail was flown into and out of the country on Ariana Afghan Airlines, and Afghans would not be able to receive financial remittances and gift packages from abroad. Yet, on October 8, 2000, the Deputy Head of the Post Department, Ministry of Communications announced in Kabul that all mail was flowing normally via land transport to Pakistan and Iran. On October 15, the Ministry of Public Health in Kabul complained to the Afghan news agency, Bakhtar, that UNSCR 1267 had led to a serious decline in public health in Afghanistan because Ariana Afghan Airlines is not able to fly in supplies for producing medicines at the Hoechst pharmaceutical factory, and because doctors and students are unable to fly to medical conferences and training seminars abroad. Hoechst ceased its operations in Afghanistan in December 1999 and has no operations, personnel, or representatives in Afghanistan. According to a Hoechst company spokesperson, this was a business decision and not because of UN sanctions. Private traders and humanitarian organizations can and do freely import medicine into Afghanistan. Private-sector imports arrive overland from Pakistan and Iran Humanitarian organizations have full exemption to fly medicine and other health-care supplies into Afghanistan.

Afghan doctors and students are free to travel by land to cities outside Afghanistan where they can board flights for foreign conferences and training, if they have the normal passports and visas required of all international travelers. QUESTION: Why is the military embargo only against the Taliban? Why not a comprehensive arms embargo against all parties conducting warfare in Afghanistan? ANSWER: UNSC Resolution 1267 and the new resolution are targeted against the Taliban because they support terrorism and provide sanctuary to Usama bin Laden. They pose a threat to peace and security in the region and elsewhere in the world. The Taliban provide arms and weapons to train and equip international terrorists. Military action will not bring peace to Afghanistan and relieve the suffering of the Afghan people. Military success is not the path for the Taliban or any other faction to gain international acceptance and assistance in rebuilding the country. The only way to end the conflict is through a political process of dialogue among all Afghans that will result in a tolerant and broad-based government. The purpose of a comprehensive military embargo against the Taliban is to ensure that the Taliban understand the international community's conviction that negotiations must replace warfare in Afghanistan so that a broadly representative government can be established, and so that Afghanistan can begin its critically needed rehabilitation. We have every intention to continue to press the other factions involved in military action in Afghanistan to join with all other Afghans to seek a peaceful, political resolution. QUESTION: United Nations Secretary General Annan's personal envoy to Afghanistan, Francesc Vendrell, has been working to broker a cease-fire and develop a peace process between the Taliban and the opposition forces led by Ahmed Shah Masood. Won't the new resolutions make his task all the harder? ANSWER: We see no reason why sanctions against the Taliban leadership because of their support for terrorism should interfere with Ambassador Vendrell's peace efforts. The peace process and the sanctions are two different tracks. The sanctions against the Taliban leadership are essential because they threaten international and regional peace and security. It is more apparent than ever that the peace that the Afghan people so desperately need cannot be attained through military action. We are deeply concerned that continued fighting in Afghanistan will lead to more civilian casualties and reprisals against civilians. Only a durable peace can end the cycle of violence", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:011211statedept.txt:3:84a0394a3e56", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 6907, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "011211statedept.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "011211statedept", "chunk_index": 4, "text": "peace efforts.

It is more apparent than ever that the peace that the Afghan people so desperately need cannot be attained through military action. We are deeply concerned that continued fighting in Afghanistan will lead to more civilian casualties and reprisals against civilians. Only a durable peace can end the cycle of violence in Afghanistan. Therefore, we welcome Ambassador Vendrell's efforts to bring the parties together to negotiate a peaceful resolution and wish him success in his important mission. QUESTION: Is it not true that the U.S. has colluded with Russia and India to back the leader of the United Islamic Front for the Salvation of Afghanistan (UIFSA), Ahmed Shah Masood? ANSWER: This is not true. The United States firmly believes that no faction on its own can bring peace and successfully govern Afghanistan. As long as one faction attempts to impose its will on the nation by force, it will face armed resistance to its goals. The United States does not arm or equip any side in the Afghan conflict. We restrict our assistance to humanitarian aid, of which we are the largest single donor. QUESTION: If the Taliban decisively defeat UIFSA leader Masood and warfare ceases in Afghanistan, will the U.S. and other countries recognize the Taliban as the legitimate government of Afghanistan, and will the Taliban gain Afghanistan's seat in the United Nations? ANSWER: Although unlikely, a Taliban military defeat of UIFSA leader Masood will not lead to peace in Afghanistan. Military successes do not mean that the Taliban will gain either international acceptance or domestic stability. Armed resistance will continue because Afghans will not accept the foreign-influenced Taliban as legitimate rulers in Afghanistan. A more broadly based and traditionally tolerant alternative must be adopted. Furthermore, international recognition and a seat in the United Nations are not dependent simply on military victory by one faction over another. A legitimate governing body gains respect and recognition by adhering to international norms, by performing the functions of a government, and by gaining the consent of the people it seeks to govern. The Taliban must take action to stop Afghanistan from being a safe-haven and breeding ground for international terrorists; make significant progress on curbing the massive production and trafficking of narcotics; improve human rights for all citizens of Afghanistan, including women, girls, and members of religious minorities; and demonstrate that they enjoy the support of the Afghan people. If they do not, the Taliban have no hope of being recognized internationally as the legitimate government of Afghanistan. QUESTION: The mass media in Pakistan and elsewhere in the region are full of speculation about a pending U.S. military strike against the Taliban and Usama bin Laden. Will the United States take military action", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:011211statedept.txt:4:382c83ffb8b5", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 6908, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "011211statedept.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "011211statedept", "chunk_index": 5, "text": "human rights for all citizens of Afghanistan, including women, girls, and members of religious minorities; and demonstrate that they enjoy the support of the Afghan people. If they do not, the Taliban have no hope of being recognized internationally as the legitimate government of Afghanistan. QUESTION: The mass media in Pakistan and elsewhere in the region are full of speculation about a pending U.S. military strike against the Taliban and Usama bin Laden. Will the United States take military action against the Taliban if they do not comply with the new UNSC resolution? ANSWER: The resolution has no measure calling for military action. The Taliban continue to maintain that they have forbidden Usama bin Laden to interfere with any other country. They also claim that they have taken away his means of communication and that, although he is their \"guest,\" bin Laden is virtually under house arrest in Afghanistan. This is not true. He and others in his organization continue actively to plan terrorist acts against the United States and other countries. We have not yet concluded who was responsible for the recent attack in the Port of Aden in Yemen against the USS Cole. However, the investigation continues. As United States senior officials have said repeatedly, we do not rule out any option if the investigation into the USS Cole incident links bin Laden to this crime. QUESTION: If the Taliban comply with the UNSC resolutions and hand over bin Laden to a place where he can be brought to justice, won't the U.S. find other reasons to keep the sanctions in place? ANSWER: Both UNSCR 1267 and the new resolution clearly state conditions that must be met. If the Taliban appear to have met the conditions, the United States would work to see that the sanctions were lifted promptly. QUESTION: Is not this new UNSC resolution really targeted against Pakistan as much as it is against the Taliban? ANSWER: No, this is not true. The new resolution is targeted against all countries that provide war materiel and military advisers and trainers to the Taliban. QUESTION: Is it not true that Pakistan is the largest single military supporter of the Taliban? ANSWER: Pakistan's public foreign policy has for years called for a peaceful settlement in Afghanistan. The international community urges Pakistan to take the necessary actions to bring that policy to fruition. QUESTION: This new Resolution contains language about narcotics. The Taliban have stated that they plan to reduce poppy cultivation significantly in Afghanistan and have called on the international community for assistance to reach this goal. Don't you believe them? Would it not be better to work with the Taliban, when they have stated their good intentions, rather than to punish them further?

The Taliban have stated that they plan to reduce poppy cultivation significantly in Afghanistan and have called on the international community for assistance to reach this goal. Don't you believe them? Would it not be better to work with the Taliban, when they have stated their good intentions, rather than to punish them further? ANSWER: Good intentions, plans, and a few demonstration projects for the benefit of international journalists, diplomats, and other observers do not prove a fundamental change in policy. However, if the Taliban, and other Afghan groups, prove by their deeds that they are making serious effort to control the rivers of narcotics flowing out of Afghanistan, then the international community should indeed take notice and find ways to cooperate with those Afghans. QUESTION: Pakistan has repeatedly said that the best way to moderate the worst tendencies of the Taliban over the long term is to engage with them. Won't the prohibition of travel by Taliban officials prevent their exposure to moderating voices and experiences elsewhere in the world? ANSWER: The new UNSC resolution does not prohibit senior Taliban officials from having contact with the rest of the world. The resolution specifically allows the UN Sanctions Committee to make case-by-case exemptions for senior Taliban officials to travel to promote compliance with UNSC resolutions, for discussions of a peaceful resolution to the conflict in Afghanistan, for verified humanitarian purposes, and for fulfilling religious obligations such as hajj. QUESTION: All this pressure against the Taliban -- is it not really because the non-Muslim world is scared of the Taliban because they claim that they represent true Islam? Is not the West scared of the international resurgence of Islam? Does not the West oppose the Muslim ummah? ANSWER: This is absolutely not true. By their actions in the United Nations and in the Organization of the Islamic Conference, it is clear that the great majority of Muslim countries do not accept the Taliban's sectarian and culturally-based interpretation of Islam. The Taliban have a radical political agenda. They use Islam to justify that agenda. The United States and other non-Muslim-majority countries have no quarrel with Islam. We have a quarrel with the Taliban who use Islam to justify their illegal and dishonorable actions and policies.

Victoria Police said Set Van Nguyen, 44, appeared to have died yesterday morning after entering an airlock into a storage laboratory filled with nitrogen. His body was found when his wife became worried after he failed to return from work. Releasing his name today, police said Mr Nguyen had worked for CSIRO's Australian Animal Health Laboratory (AAHL) as a microbiologist for 15 years. He was killed after entering a low temperature storage area where biological samples were kept. [an error occurred while processing this directive] Police said he did not know the room was full of deadly gas which had leaked from a liquid nitrogen cooling system. Unable to breathe, he collapsed and died. Safety authorities are still investigating. Mr Nguyen's death brings Victoria's workplace death toll to 29 this year. **AAP ** FAIR USE NOTICE: This site contains copyrighted material the use of which has not always been specifically authorized by the copyright owner.

Were criminals responsible for the sharp rise in credit card transactions that moved through some computer systems at the center shortly before the planes hit the twin towers? Or was it coincidence that unusually large sums of money, perhaps more than $100 million, were rushed through the computers as the disaster unfolded? A world leader in retrieving data, German-based firm Convar is trying to answer those questions and help credit card companies, telecommunications firms and accountants in New York recover records from computer hard drives that have been partially damaged by fire, water or fine dust. Using a pioneering laser scanning technology to find data on damaged computer hard drives and main frames found in the rubble of the World Trade Center and other nearby collapsed buildings, **Convar has recovered information from 32 computers that support assumptions of dirty doomsday dealings.** \"The suspicion is that inside information about the attack was used to send financial transaction commands and authorizations in the belief that amid all the chaos the", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:011218reuters.txt:0:2706cc8ab293", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 6914, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "011218reuters.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "011218reuters", "chunk_index": 1, "text": "partially damaged by fire, water or fine dust. Using a pioneering laser scanning technology to find data on damaged computer hard drives and main frames found in the rubble of the World Trade Center and other nearby collapsed buildings, **Convar has recovered information from 32 computers that support assumptions of dirty doomsday dealings.** \"The suspicion is that inside information about the attack was used to send financial transaction commands and authorizations in the belief that amid all the chaos the criminals would have, at the very least, a good head start,\" said Convar director Peter Henschel. \"Of course it is also possible that there were perfectly legitimate reasons for the unusual rise in business volume,\" he told Reuters in an interview. **PROFITING FROM DISASTER? ** \"It could turn out that Americans went on an absolute shopping binge on that Tuesday morning. But at this point there are many transactions that cannot be accounted for,'' Henschel said. \"Not only the volume but the size of the transactions was far higher than usual for a day like that. There is a suspicion that these were possibly planned to take advantage of the chaos.'' Nearly 3,300 people were killed in the attacks that destroyed the World Trade Center. Some 30,000 people in the buildings, symbols of America's financial might, were able to escape between the time the planes crashed and about an hour later when they collapsed -- even though many of the unmanned computers continued working. The United States blames the al Qaeda group led by Saudi-born Osama bin Laden for the attack and has since waged war on the Taliban regime in Afghanistan that sheltered them. There are several data-retrieval companies in the United States and Europe, but Convar said it has won the lion's share of the contracts from the World Trade Center because of its laser scanning technology. Convar developed the laser scanner two years ago that made it possible to retrieve data from badly damaged computers. With a staff of 30 in its high-security facility in Pirmasens near the French border, the firm has worked with the U.S. armed forces in Germany as well as German federal police for the last 15 years. Its offices in Pirmasens, a town of 36,000 still suffering from the departure of some 4,000 American soldiers stationed here during the Cold War, are closely guarded behind high fences and monitored by dozens of security cameras. Inside the building, an endless series of code-operated door locks keeps unwelcome visitors away. In the center of the facility is a 1,292 square foot, dust-free \"clean room\" where the damaged computer drives are coaxed back to life. Citing client privacy, Henschel declined to say which companies Convar is working for, or provide details about the data retrieved so far. But he said the raw material, up to 40 gigabytes per computer hard drive, is sent immediately by", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:011218reuters.txt:1:67710f14d6c1", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 6915, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "011218reuters.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "011218reuters", "chunk_index": 2, "text": "security cameras.

Citing client privacy, Henschel declined to say which companies Convar is working for, or provide details about the data retrieved so far. But he said the raw material, up to 40 gigabytes per computer hard drive, is sent immediately by satellite or courier back to New York. **MONEY TRAIL ** Richard Wagner, a data retrieval expert at the company, said illegal transfers of more than $100 million might have been made immediately before and during the disaster. \"There is a suspicion that some people had advance knowledge of the approximate time of the plane crashes in order to move out amounts exceeding $100 million,'' Wagner said. \"They thought that the records of their transactions could not be traced after the main frames were destroyed.'' The companies are paying between $20,000 and $30,000 for each computer recovered, Henschel said. The high recovery costs are one reason why only a limited number of hard drives are being examined. Convar has turned down a request by one British newspaper to try to recover personal last hour e-mails sent by someone trapped in the doomed building. Henschel said the companies in the United States were working together with the FBI to piece together what happened Sept 11 and that he was confident the destination of the dubious transactions would one day be tracked down. \"We have been quite surprised that so many of the hard drives were in good enough shape to retrieve the data,'' he said. \"The contamination rate is high. The fine dust that was everywhere in the area got pressed under high pressure into the drives. But we've still been able to retrieve 100 percent of the data on most of the drives we've received. \"We're helping them find out what happened to the computers Sept 11 as quickly as possible. I'm sure that one day they will know what happened to the money.'' **Note:** A German news video from March 11, 2002 at [this link](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-OClX54EFQ) reveals that this work was being paid for and overseen by the U.S. Department of Defense.

Planes were bearing down on the capital. The White House was evacuated, leaving the national security team alone, trying to control a nation suddenly under siege and wondering if they were next. Mr. Miller had an aide send out the names of those present by e-mail \"so that when and if we died, someone would know who was in there.\" Somewhere in the havoc of the moment, Richard A. Clarke, then the White House counterterrorism chief, recalled the long drumbeat of warnings about terrorists striking on American soil, many of them delivered and debated in that very room. After a third hijacked jet had sliced into the Pentagon, others heard Mr. Clarke say it first: \"This is Al Qaeda.\" An extensive review of the nation's antiterrorism efforts shows that for years before Sept. 11, terror experts throughout the government understood the apocalyptic designs of Osama bin Laden. But the top leaders never reacted as if they believed the country was as vulnerable as it proved to be that morning. Dozens of interviews with current and former officials demonstrate that even as the threat of terrorism mounted through eight years of the Clinton administration and eight months of President Bush, the government did not marshal its full forces against it. The defensive work of tightening the borders and airport security was studied but never quite completed. And though the White House undertook a covert campaign to kill Mr. bin Laden, the government never mustered the critical mass of political will and on-the-ground intelligence for the kind of offensive against Al Qaeda it unleashed this fall.

And though the White House undertook a covert campaign to kill Mr. bin Laden, the government never mustered the critical mass of political will and on-the-ground intelligence for the kind of offensive against Al Qaeda it unleashed this fall. The rising threat of the Islamic jihad movement was first detected by United States investigators after the 1993 bombing of the World Trade Center. The inquiry into that attack revealed a weakness in the immigration system used by one of the terrorists, but that hole was never plugged, and it was exploited by one of the Sept. 11 hijackers. In 1996, a State Department dossier spelled out Mr. bin Laden's operation and his anti-American intentions. And President Bill Clinton's own pollster told him the public would rally behind a war on terrorism. But none was declared. By 1997, the threat of an Islamic attack on America was so well recognized that an F.B.I. agent warned of it in a public speech. But that same year, a strategy for tightening airline security, proposed by a vice- presidential panel, was largely ignored. In 2000, after an Algerian was caught coming into the country with explosives, a secret White House review recommended a crackdown on \"potential sleeper cells in the United States.\" That review warned that \"the threat of attack remains high\" and laid out a plan for fighting terrorism. But most of that plan remained undone. Last spring, when new threats surfaced, the Bush administration devised a new strategy, which officials said included a striking departure from previous policy - an extensive C.I.A. program to arm the Northern Alliance and other anti-Taliban forces in Afghanistan. That new proposal had wound its way to the desk of the national security adviser, Condoleezza Rice, and was ready to be delivered to the president for final approval on Monday, Sept. 10. The government's fight against terrorism always seemed to fall short. The Sept. 11 attack \"was a systematic failure of the way this country protects itself,\" said James Woolsey, a former director of central intelligence. \"It's aviation security delegated to the airlines, who did a lousy job. It's a fighter aircraft deployment failure. It's a foreign intelligence collection failure. It's a domestic detection failure. It's a visa and immigration policy failure.\" The Clinton administration intensified efforts against Al Qaeda after two United States Embassies in Africa were bombed in 1998. But by then, the terror network had gone global - \"Al Qaeda became Starbucks,\" said Charles Duelfer, a former State Department official - with cells across Europe, Africa and beyond. Even so, according to the interviews and documents, the government response to terrorism remained measured, even halting, reflecting the competing interests and judgments involved in fighting an ill-defined foe.

Even so, according to the interviews and documents, the government response to terrorism remained measured, even halting, reflecting the competing interests and judgments involved in fighting an ill-defined foe. The main weapon in President Clinton's campaign to kill Mr. bin Laden and his lieutenants was cruise missiles, which are fired from thousands of miles away. While that made it difficult to hit Mr. bin Laden as he moved around Afghanistan, the president was reluctant to put American lives at risk. But a basic problem throughout the fight against terrorism has been the lack of inside information. The C.I.A. was surprised repeatedly by Mr. bin Laden, not so much because it failed to pay attention, but because it lacked sources inside Al Qaeda. There were no precise warnings of impending attacks, and the C.I.A. could not provide an exact location for Mr. bin Laden, which was essential to the objective of killing him. At the F.B.I., it was not until last year that all field offices were ordered to get engaged in the war on terrorism and develop sources. Inside the bureau, the seminars and other activities that accompanied these orders were nicknamed \"Terrorism for Dummies,\" a stark acknowledgment of how far the agency had not come in the seven years since the first trade center attack. \"I get upset when I hear complaints from Congress that the F.B.I. is not sharing its intelligence,\" said a former senior law enforcement official in the Clinton and Bush administrations. \"The problem is that there isn't any to share. There is very little. And the stuff we can share is not worth sharing.\" Officials at the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Central Intelligence Agency said that they had some success in foiling Al Qaeda plots, but that the structure of the group made it difficult to penetrate. \"It is understandable, but unrealistic, especially given our authorities and resources, to expect us to be perfect,\" said Bill Harlow, a C.I.A. spokesman. The reasons the government was not more single-minded in attacking Al Qaeda will be examined exhaustively and from every angle by Congress and others in the years ahead. In an era of opulence and invincibility, the threat of terrorism never took root as a dominant political issue. Mr. bin Laden's boldest attack on American property before Sept. 11 - the embassy bombings - came in the same summer that the Monica Lewinsky scandal was engulfing President Clinton.

A full fight against terrorism might have meant the sacrifice of money, individual liberties and, perhaps, lives - and even then without any guarantee of success. Mr. Clarke, until recently the White House director of counterterrorism, warned of the threat for years and reached this conclusion: \"Democracies don't prepare well for things that have never happened before.\" **The First Warning** *A Horrible Surprise At the Trade Center* On Feb. 26, 1993 - a month after Bill Clinton took office, having vowed to focus on strengthening the domestic economy \"like a laser\" - the World Trade Center was bombed by Islamic extremists operating from Brooklyn and New Jersey. Six people were killed, and hundreds injured. Today, American experts see that attack as the first of many missed warnings. \"In retrospect, the wake-up call should have been the 1993 World Trade Center bombing,\" said Michael Sheehan, counterterrorism coordinator at the State Department in the last years of the Clinton presidency. The implications of the F.B.I.'s investigation were disturbingly clear: A dangerous phenomenon had taken root. Young Muslims who had fought with the Afghan rebels against the Soviet Union in the 1980's had taken their jihad to American shores. The F.B.I. was \"caught almost totally unaware that these guys were in here,\" recalled Robert M. Blitzer, a former senior counterterrorism official in the bureau's headquarters. \"It was alarming to us that these guys had been coming and going since 1985 and we didn't know.\" One of the names that surfaced in the bombing case was that of a Saudi exile named Osama bin Laden, F.B.I. officials say. Mr. bin Laden, they learned, was financing the Office of Services, a Pakistan-based group involved in organizing the new jihad. And it turned out that the mastermind of the trade center attack, Ramzi Yousef, had stayed for several months in a Pakistani guest house supported by Mr. bin Laden. But if the first World Trade Center bombing raised the consciousness of some at the F.B.I., it had little lasting resonance for the White House. Mr. Clinton, who would prove gifted at leading the nation through sorrowful occasions, never visited the site. Congress tightened immigration laws, but the concern about porous borders quickly dissipated and the new rules were never put in effect. Leon E. Panetta, the former congressman who was budget director and later chief of staff during Mr. Clinton's first term, said senior aides viewed terrorism as just one of many pressing global problems. \"Clinton was aware of the threat and sometimes he would mention it,\" Mr. Panetta said.

But the \"big issues\" in the president's first term, he said, were \"Russia, Eastern bloc, Middle East peace, human rights, rogue nations and then terrorism.\" When it came to terrorism, Clinton administration officials continued the policy of their predecessors, who had viewed it primarily as a crime to be solved and prosecuted by law enforcement agencies. That approach, which called for grand jury indictments, created its own problems. The trade center investigation produced promising leads that pointed overseas. But Mr. Woolsey said in an interview that this material was not shared with the C.I.A. because of rules governing grand jury secrecy. The C.I.A. faced its own obstacles, former agency officials say. In the wake of the Soviet Union's withdrawal from Afghanistan in 1989, the agency virtually abandoned the region, leaving it with few sources of information about the rising radical threat. Looking back, George Stephanopoulos, the president's adviser for policy and strategy in his first term, said he believed the 1993 attack did not gain more attention because, in the end, it \"wasn't a successful bombing.\" He added: \"It wasn't the kind of thing where you walked into a staff meeting and people asked, what are we doing today in the war against terrorism?\" Two years later, however, terrorism moved to the forefront of the national agenda when a truck bomb tore into the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City on April 19, 1995, killing 168 people. President Clinton visited Oklahoma City for a memorial service, signaling the political import of the event. \"We're going to have to be very, very tough in dealing with this,\" he declared in an interview. Mr. Panetta said that plans to reorganize the government's counterterrorism efforts were quickly revived. Senior officials recognized that the United States remained vulnerable to terrorism. The bombing proved to be the work of two Americans, both former soldiers, but if Oklahoma City could be hit, an attack by terrorists of any stripe could \"happen at the White House,\" Mr. Panetta said. Two months after the bombing, Mr. Clinton ordered the government to intensify the fight against terrorism. The order did not give agencies involved in the fight more money, nor did it end the bureaucratic turf battles among them. But it did put Mr. bin Laden, who had set up operations in Sudan after leaving Afghanistan in 1991, front and center. **Diplomacy and Politics** *A Growing Effort Against bin Laden* As Mr. Clinton prepared his re-election bid in 1996,", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:011230nytimes.txt:4:257fed791b23", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 6922, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "011230nytimes.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "011230nytimes", "chunk_index": 5, "text": "Panetta said.

Recognizing the growing significance of Mr. bin Laden, the C.I.A. created a virtual station, code-named Alex, to track his activities around the world. In the Middle East, American diplomats pressed the hard-line Islamic regime of Sudan to expel Mr. bin Laden, even if that pushed him back into Afghanistan. To build support for this effort among Middle Eastern governments, the State Department circulated a dossier that accused Mr. bin Laden of financing radical Islamic causes around the world. The document implicated him in several attacks on Americans, including the 1992 bombing of a hotel in Aden, Yemen, where American troops had stayed on their way to Somalia. It also said Mr. bin Laden's associates had trained the Somalis who killed 18 American servicemen in Mogadishu in 1993. Sudanese officials met with their C.I.A. and State Department counterparts and signaled that they might turn Mr. bin Laden over to another country. Saudi Arabia and Egypt were possibilities. State Department and C.I.A. officials urged both Egypt and Saudi Arabia to accept him, according to former Clinton officials. \"But both were afraid of the domestic reaction and refused,\" one recalled. Critics of the administration's effort said this was an early missed opportunity to destroy Al Qaeda. Mr. Clinton himself would have had to lean hard on the Saudi and Egyptian governments. The White House believed no amount of pressure would change the outcome, and Mr. Clinton risked spending valuable capital on a losing cause. \"We were not about to have the president make a call and be told no,\" one official explained. Sudan obliquely hinted that it might turn Mr. bin Laden over to the United States, a former official said. But the Justice Department reviewed the case and concluded in the spring of 1996 that it did not have enough evidence to charge him with the attacks on American troops in Yemen and Somalia. In May 1996, Sudan expelled Mr. bin Laden, confiscating some of his substantial fortune. He moved his organization to Afghanistan, just as an obscure group known as the Taliban was taking control of the country. Clinton administration officials counted it as a positive step. Mr. bin Laden was on the run, deprived of the tacit state sponsorship he had enjoyed in Sudan. \"He lost his base and momentum,\" said Samuel R.

Berger, Mr. Clinton's national security adviser in his second term. In July 1996, shortly after Mr. bin Laden left Sudan, Mr. Clinton met at the White House with Dick Morris, his political adviser, to hone themes for his re-election campaign. The previous month, a suicide bomber had detonated a truck bomb at a military barracks in Saudi Arabia, killing 19 American servicemen. Days later, T.W.A. Flight 800 had exploded off Long Island, leaving 230 people dead in a crash that was immediately viewed as terrorism. Mr. Morris said he had devised an attack advertisement of the sort that Senator Bob Dole, the Republican candidate, might use against Mr. Clinton and had shown it to a sampling of voters. Seven percent of those who saw it said they would switch from Mr. Clinton to Mr. Dole. \"Out of control. Two airline disasters. One linked to terrorism,\" the advertisement said. \"F.A.A. asleep at the switch. Terror in Saudi Arabia.\" Mr. Morris said he told Mr. Clinton that he could neutralize such a line of attack by adopting tougher policies on terrorism and airport security. He said his polls had found support for tightening security and confronting terrorists. Voters favored military action against suspected terrorist installations in other countries. They backed a federal takeover of airport screening and even supported deployment of the military inside the United States to fight terrorism. Mr. Morris said he tried and failed to persuade the president to undertake a broader war on terrorism. Mr. Clinton declined repeated requests for an interview, but a spokeswoman, Julia Payne, said: \"Terrorism was always a top priority in the Clinton administration. The president chose to get his foreign policy advice from the likes of Sandy Berger and Madeleine Albright and not Dick Morris.\" On July 25, Mr. Clinton announced that he had put Vice President Al Gore at the head of a commission on aviation safety and security. Within weeks, the panel had drafted more than two dozen recommendations. Its final report, in February 1997, added dozens more. Among the most important, commission members said, was a proposal that the F.B.I. and C.I.A. share information about suspected terrorists for the databases maintained by each airline. If a suspected terrorist bought a ticket, both the airline and the government would find out. Progress was slow, particularly after federal investigators determined that the crash of T.W.A.

Flight 800 resulted from a mechanical flaw, not terrorism. The commission's recommendation languished - until Sept. 11, when two people already identified by the government as suspected terrorists boarded separate American Airlines flights from Boston using their own names. That morning, no alarms went off. The system proposed by the Gore commission was still not in place. The government is now moving to share more information with the airlines about suspected terrorists. \"Unfortunately, it takes a dramatic event to focus the government's and public's attention, especially on an issue as amorphous as terrorism,\" said Gerry Kauvar, staff director of the commission and now a senior policy analyst at the RAND Corporation. **Focusing on Al Qaeda** *A Clearer Picture, A Disjointed Fight* As Mr. Clinton began his second term, American intelligence agencies were assembling a clearer picture of the threat posed by Mr. bin Laden and Al Qaeda, which was making substantial headway in Afghanistan. A few months earlier, the first significant defector from Al Qaeda had walked into an American Embassy in Africa and provided a detailed account of the organization's operations and ultimate objectives. The defector, Jamal Ahmed al-Fadl, told American officials that Mr. bin Laden had taken aim at the United States and other Western governments, broadening his initial goal of overthrowing Saudi Arabia and other \"infidel\" Middle Eastern governments. He said that Al Qaeda was trying to buy a nuclear bomb and other unconventional weapons. Mr. bin Laden was also trying to form an anti-American terrorist front that would unite radical groups. But Mr. Fadl's statements were not widely circulated within the government. A senior official said their significance was not fully understood by Mr. Clinton's top advisers until his public testimony in 2000. The war against Al Qaeda remained disjointed. While the State Department listed Mr. bin Laden as a financier of terror in its 1996 survey of terrorism, Al Qaeda was not included on the list of terrorist organizations subject to various sanctions released by the United States in 1997. The F.B.I.'s counterterrorism experts, who were privy to Mr. Fadl's debriefings, were growing increasingly concerned about Islamic terrorism. \"Almost all of the groups today, if they chose, have the ability to strike us in the United States,\" John P. O'Neill, a senior F.B.I. official involved in counterterrorism, warned in a June 1997 speech. The task, Mr. O'Neill said, was to \"nick away\" at terrorists' ability to operate in the United States.

(Mr. O'Neill left the F.B.I. this year for a job as chief of security at the World Trade Center, where he died on Sept. 11.) As Mr. O'Neill spoke in Chicago, the F.B.I. and C.I.A. was homing in on a Qaeda cell in Nairobi, Kenya. The National Security Agency began eavesdropping on telephone lines used by Al Qaeda members in the country. On several occasions, calls to Mr. bin Laden's satellite phone in Afghanistan were overheard. The F.B.I. and C.I.A. searched a house in Kenya, seizing a computer and questioning Wadih El-Hage, an American citizen working as Mr. bin Laden's personal secretary. American officials counted the operations as a success and believed they had disrupted a potentially dangerous terrorist cell. They were proved wrong on Aug. 7, 1998, when truck bombs were detonated outside the United States embassies in Nairobi and Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, killing 224 people, including 12 Americans, and injuring more than 5,000. Stunned by the plot's ambition and precision, Mr. Clinton vowed to punish the perpetrators, who were quickly identified as Al Qaeda adherents. \"No matter how long it takes or where it takes us,\" the president said, \"we will pursue terrorists until the cases are solved and justice is done.\" The political calculus, however, had changed markedly since the president's triumph in the fall of 1996, and Mr. Clinton was in no position to mount a sustained war against terrorism. His administration was weighed down by a scandal over his relationship with a White House intern. Mr. Clinton was about to acknowledge to a grand jury that his public and private denials of the affair had been misleading. Republicans depicted every foreign policy decision as an attempt to distract voters. Thirteen days after the embassy bombings, President Clinton nonetheless ordered cruise missile strikes on a Qaeda camp in Afghanistan and a pharmaceutical plant in Sudan that officials said was linked to Mr. bin Laden and chemical weapons. But the volley of cruise missiles proved a setback for American counterterrorism efforts. The C.I.A. had been told that Mr. bin Laden and his entourage were meeting at the camp, but the missiles struck just a few hours after he left. And the owner of the pharmaceutical factory came forward to claim that it had nothing to do with chemical weapons, raising questions about whether the Sudan strike had been in error.

The Clinton administration stood by its actions, but several former officials said the criticism had an effect on the pursuit of Al Qaeda: Mr. Clinton became even more cautious about using force against terrorists. Unfortunately, the quarry was becoming more dangerous. In the two years since leaving Sudan, Mr. bin Laden had built a formidable base in Afghanistan. He lavished millions of dollars on the impoverished Taliban regime and in exchange was allowed to operate a network of training camps that attracted Islamic militants from all over the world. In early 1998, just as he declared war on Americans everywhere in the world, he cemented an alliance with Egyptian Islamic Jihad, a ruthless and effective group whose leader, Ayman al-Zawahiri, was known for his operational skills. **The Battle Intensifies** *Struggling to Track 'Enemy No. 1'* In the years after the embassy bombings, the Clinton administration significantly stepped up its efforts to destroy Al Qaeda, tracking its finances, plotting military strikes to wipe out its leadership and prosecuting its members for the bombings and other crimes. \"From August 1998, bin Laden was Enemy No. 1,\" Mr. Berger said. The campaign had the support of President Clinton and his senior aides. But former administration officials acknowledge that it never became the government's top priority. When it came to Pakistan, for example, American diplomats continued to weigh the war on terrorism against other pressing issues, including the need to enlist Islamabad's help in averting a nuclear exchange with India. Similarly, a proposal to vastly enhance the Treasury Department's ability to track global flows of terrorist money languished until after Sept. 11. And American officials were reluctant to press the oil-rich Saudis to crack down on charities linked to radical causes. Still, the fight against Al Qaeda gained new, high-level attention after the embassy attacks, present and former officials say. Between 1998 and 2000, the \"Small Group\" of the Cabinet-rank principals involved in national security met almost every week on terrorism, and the Counterterrorism Security Group, led by Mr. Clarke, met two or three times a week, officials said. The United States disrupted some Qaeda cells, and persuaded friendly intelligence services to arrange the arrest and transfer of Al Qaeda members without formal extradition or legal proceedings. Dozens were quietly sent to Egypt and other countries to stand trial. President Clinton also ordered a more aggressive program of covert action, signing an intelligence order that allowed him to use lethal force against Mr. bin Laden.

Dozens were quietly sent to Egypt and other countries to stand trial. President Clinton also ordered a more aggressive program of covert action, signing an intelligence order that allowed him to use lethal force against Mr. bin Laden. Later, this was expanded to include as many as a dozen of his top lieutenants, officials said. On at least four occasions, Mr. Clinton sent the C.I.A. a secret \"memorandum of notification,\" authorizing the government to kill or capture Mr. bin Laden and, later, other senior operatives. The C.I.A. then briefed members of Congress about those plans. The C.I.A. redoubled its efforts to track Mr. bin Laden's movements, stationing submarines in the Indian Ocean to await the president's launch order. To hit Mr. bin Laden, the military said it needed to know where he would be 6 to 10 hours later - enough time to review the decision in Washington and program the cruise missiles. That search proved frustrating. Officials said the C.I.A. did have some spies within Afghanistan. **On at least three occasions between 1998 and 2000, the C.I.A. told the White House it had learned where Mr. bin Laden was and where he might soon be. ** **Each time, Mr. Clinton approved the strike. Each time, George Tenet, the director of central intelligence, called the president to say that the information was not reliable enough to be used in an attack,** a former senior Clinton administration official said. In late 1998, according to former officials, intelligence agents reported that Abu Hafs, a Mauritanian and an important figure in Al Qaeda, was staying in Room 13 at the Dana Hotel in Khartoum. With such specific information in hand, White House officials wanted Abu Hafs either killed or, preferably, captured and transferred out of Sudan to a friendly state where he could be interrogated, the former officials said. The agency initially questioned whether it could accomplish such a mission in a hostile, risky environment like Sudan, putting it in the \"too hard to do box,\" one former official said. An intelligence official disputed this account, saying the C.I.A. made \"a full-tilt effort in a very dangerous environment.\" Eventually, the C.I.A. enlisted another government to help seize Abu Hafs, a former official said, but by then it was too late. The target had disappeared. Officials said the White House pushed the Joint Chiefs of Staff to develop plans for a commando raid to capture or kill Mr. bin Laden. But the chairman, Gen. Henry H. Shelton, and other senior Pentagon officers told Mr. Clinton's top national security aides that they would need to know Mr. bin Laden's whereabouts 12 to 24 hours in advance.

Pentagon planners also considered a White House request to send a hunter team of commandos, small enough to avoid detection, the officer said. General Shelton discounted this option as nave, the officer said. White House officials were frustrated that the Pentagon could not produce plans that involved a modest number of troops. Military planners insisted that an attack on Al Qaeda required thousands of troops invading Afghanistan. \"When you said this is what it would take, no one was interested,\" a senior officer said. A former administration official recently defended the decision not to employ a commando strike. \"It would have been an assault without the kind of war we've seen over the last three months to support it,\" the official said. \"And it would have been very unlikely to succeed.\" Clinton administration officials also began trying to choke off Al Qaeda's financial network. Shortly after the embassy bombings, the United States began threatening states and financial institutions with sanctions if they failed to cut off assistance to those who did business with Al Qaeda and the Taliban. In 1999 and early 2000, some $255 million of Taliban-controlled assets was blocked in United States accounts, according to William F. Wechsler, a former White House official. Mr. Wechsler said the search for Al Qaeda's assets was often stymied by poor cooperation from Middle Eastern and South Asian states. The United States, too, he added, had problems. \"Few intelligence officials who understand the nuances of the global banking system\" were fluent in Arabic. While the C.I.A. had done a \"reasonably good job\" analyzing Al Qaeda, he wrote, it was \"poor\" at developing sources within Mr. bin Laden's financial network. The F.B.I., he argued, had similar shortcomings. Senior officials were frustrated by the C.I.A.'s inability to find hard facts about Al Qaeda's financial operations. Intelligence officials said the C.I.A. had amassed considerable detail about the group's finances, and that information was used in the broad efforts to freeze its accounts after Sept. 11. At the State Department, officials reacted sharply to the assault on the embassies. Michael Sheehan, the department's former counterterrorism coordinator, said that after the bombings, Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright met with her embassy security director every morning and became increasingly focused on efforts to protect her employees and installations. But to Mr. Sheehan, the response was inadequate. He believed that terrorism could be contained only if Washington devised a \"comprehensive political strategy", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:011230nytimes.txt:11:4e717f084c6f", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 6929, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "011230nytimes.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "011230nytimes", "chunk_index": 12, "text": "freeze its accounts after Sept. 11.

He believed that terrorism could be contained only if Washington devised a \"comprehensive political strategy to pressure Pakistan and other neighbors and allies into isolating not only Mr. bin Laden and Al Qaeda, but the Taliban and others who provide them sanctuary,\" he said, and that did not happen. There were competing priorities. \"Our reaction was responsive, almost never proactive,\" he said. **'We Were Flying Blind'** *An Arrest, a Review And New Obstacles* The arrest of Ahmed Ressam was the clearest sign that Osama bin Laden was trying to bring the jihad to the United States. Mr. Ressam was arrested when he tried to enter the United States in Port Angeles, Wash., on Dec. 14, 1999. Inside his rental car, agents found 130 pounds of bomb-making chemicals and detonator components. His arrest helped reveal what intelligence officials later concluded was a Qaeda plot to unleash attacks during the millennium celebrations, aimed at an American ship in Yemen, tourist sites and a hotel in Jordan, and unknown targets in the United States. \"That was a wake-up call,\" a senior law enforcement officer said, \"not for law enforcement and intelligence, but for policy makers.\" Just as the embassy bombings had exposed the threat of Al Qaeda overseas, the millennium plot revealed gaping vulnerabilities at home. \"If you understood Al Qaeda, you knew something was going to happen,\" said Robert M. Bryant, who was the deputy director of the F.B.I. when he retired in 1999. \"You knew they were going to hit us, but you didn't know where. It just made me sick on Sept. 11. I cried when those towers came down.\" A White House review of American defenses in March 2000 found significant shortcomings in nearly a decade of government efforts to improve defenses against terrorists at home. The F.B.I. and the Immigration and Naturalization Service, it said, should begin \"high tempo, ongoing operations to arrest, detain and deport potential sleeper cells in the United States.\" The review called for the government to greatly expand its antiterrorism efforts inside the United States, creating an additional dozen joint federal-local task forces like the one that had been set up in New York. The review identified particular weaknesses in the nation's immigration controls, officials said. The government remained unable to track foreigners in the United States on student visas, despite a 1996 law passed after the first World Trade Center bombing that required it to do so.

The government remained unable to track foreigners in the United States on student visas, despite a 1996 law passed after the first World Trade Center bombing that required it to do so. In June 2000, after the millennium plot was revealed, the National Commission on Terrorism recommended that the immigration service set up a system to keep tabs on foreign students. Academic institutions opposed the recommendation, fearing that a strict reporting requirement might alienate prospective foreign students, according to government officials. Nothing changed. As the commission was completing its work, the Sept. 11 hijackers began entering the United States. One of the 19 hijackers, Hani Hanjour, who had traveled on a student visa, failed to show up for school and remained in the country illegally. The F.B.I. had some problems of its own. It had no intelligence warning of an attack on Los Angeles International Airport, which investigators eventually learned was Mr. Ressam's intended target. Beginning in 1997, senior officials at the bureau had begun to rethink their approach to terrorism, viewing it now as a crime to be prevented rather than solved. But it was the millennium plot that revealed how ill equipped the bureau was to radically shift its culture, former officials say. It lacked informers within terrorist groups. It did not have the computer and analytical capacity for integrating disparate pieces of information. \"We did not have any actionable intelligence,\" one senior official said. \"We were flying blind.\" In March 2000, Dale L. Watson, the F.B.I.'s assistant director for counterterrorism, started a series of seminars with agents who headed the bureau's 56 field offices. Each field office was required to establish a joint terrorism task force with local police departments, modeled after the arrangement begun in New York in the mid-1980's. Field office chiefs were also told to hire more Arabic translators and develop better sources of information. Mr. Watson said that the meetings were a centerpiece of efforts to shore up the bureau's counterterrorism work that had begun several years earlier. The meetings, he said, were \"designed to bring every office, no matter how small, to the same top terrorism capacities resident in our larger offices like New York.\" The F.B.I. renewed its push on Capitol Hill for money to create a computer system that would allow various field offices to share and analyze information collected by agents. Until late last year, Congress had refused to pay for the project. Without the analytical aid of a computer system, Mr. Bryant said, the bureau's counterterrorism program would be hobbled, particularly if the goal was to avert a crime. \"We didn't know what we had,\" he said. \"We didn't know what", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:011230nytimes.txt:13:61e01d3bea32", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 6931, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "011230nytimes.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "011230nytimes", "chunk_index": 14, "text": "The F.B.I. renewed its push on Capitol Hill for money to create a computer system that would allow various field offices to share and analyze information collected by agents.

In September 2000, an unarmed, unmanned spy plane called the Predator flew test flights over Afghanistan, providing what several administration officials called incomparably detailed real-time video and photographs of the movements of what appeared to be Mr. bin Laden and his aides. The White House pressed ahead with a program to arm the Predator with a missile, but the effort was slowed by bureaucratic infighting between the Pentagon and the C.I.A. over who would pay for the craft and who would have ultimate authority over its use. The dispute, officials said, was not resolved until after Sept. 11. On Oct. 12, an explosive-laden dinghy piloted by two suicide bombers exploded next to the American destroyer Cole in Yemen, killing 17 sailors. Intelligence analysts linked the bombing to Al Qaeda, but at a series of Cabinet-level meetings, Mr. Tenet of the C.I.A. and senior F.B.I. officials said the case was not conclusive. Mr. Clarke, the White House counterterrorism director, had no doubts about whom to punish. In late October, officials said, he put on the table an idea he had been pushing for some time: bombing Mr. bin Laden's largest training camps in Afghanistan. With the administration locked in a fevered effort to broker a peace settlement in Israel, an election imminent and the two- term Clinton administration coming to a close, the recommendation went nowhere. Terrorism was not raised as an issue by either Vice President Al Gore or George W. Bush in the 2000 presidential campaign. In October 2000, the administration took another shot at killing Mr. bin Laden. When Mr. Berger called the president to tell him the effort had failed, he recalled, Mr. Clinton cursed. \"Just keep trying,\" he said. **The New Team** *Seeing the Threat But Moving Slowly* As he prepared to leave office last January, Mr. Berger met with his successor, Condoleezza Rice, and gave her a warning. According to both of them, he said that terrorism - and particularly Mr. bin Laden's brand of it - would consume far more of her time than she had ever imagined. A month later, with the administration still getting organized, Mr. Tenet, whom President Bush had asked to stay on at the C.I.A., warned the Senate Intelligence Committee that Mr. bin Laden and Al Qaeda remained \"the", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:011230nytimes.txt:14:7d15d1c4c11e", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 6932, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "011230nytimes.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "011230nytimes", "chunk_index": 15, "text": "Mr. Berger met with his successor, Condoleezza Rice, and gave her a warning.

A month later, with the administration still getting organized, Mr. Tenet, whom President Bush had asked to stay on at the C.I.A., warned the Senate Intelligence Committee that Mr. bin Laden and Al Qaeda remained \"the most immediate and serious threat\" to security. But until Sept. 11, the people at the top levels of the Bush administration may, if anything, have been less preoccupied by terrorism than the Clinton aides. At the C.I.A., according to former Clinton administration officials, Mr. Tenet's actions did not match his words. For example, one intelligence official said, the C.I.A. station in Pakistan remained understaffed and underfinanced, though the C.I.A. denied that. In March, the White House's Counterterrorism Security Group began drafting its own strategy for combating Al Qaeda. Mr. Clarke was still nominally in charge, but Bush aides were on the way to approving Mr. Clarke's recommendation that his group be divided into several new offices. Mr. Bush's principals did not formally meet to discuss terrorism in late spring when intercepts from Afghanistan warned that Al Qaeda was planning to attack an American target in late June or perhaps over the July 4 holiday. They did not meet even after intelligence analysts overheard conversations from a Qaeda cell in Milan suggesting that Mr. bin Laden's agents might be plotting to kill Mr. Bush at the European summit meeting in Genoa, Italy, in late July. Administration officials say the president was concerned about the growing threat and frustrated by the halfhearted efforts to thwart Al Qaeda. In July, Ms. Rice said, Mr. Bush likened the response to the Qaeda threat to \"swatting at flies.\" He said he wanted a plan to \"bring this guy down.\" The administration's draft plan for fighting Al Qaeda included a $200 million C.I.A. program that, among other things, would arm the Taliban's enemies. Clinton administration officials had refused to provide significant money and arms to the Northern Alliance, which was composed mostly of ethnic minorities. Officials feared that large-scale support for the rebels would involve the United States too deeply in a civil war and anger Pakistan. President Bush's national security advisers approved the plan on Sept. 4, a senior administration official said, and it was to be presented to the president on Sept. 10. (However, the leader of the Northern Alliance was assassinated by Qaeda agents on Sept. 9.) Mr. Bush was traveling on Sept. 10 and did not receive it.

Crucial evidence that could answer many questions about high-rise building design practices and performance under fire conditions is on the slow boat to China, perhaps never to be seen again in America until you buy your next car. Such destruction of evidence shows the astounding ignorance of government officials to the value of a thorough, scientific investigation of the largest fire-induced collapse in world history. I have combed through our national standard for fire investigation, NFPA 921, but nowhere in it does one find an exemption allowing the destruction of evidence for buildings over 10 stories tall. Hoping beyond hope, I have called experts to ask if the towers were the only high-rise buildings in America of lightweight, center-core construction. No such luck. I made other calls asking if these were the only buildings in America with light-density, sprayed-on fireproofing. Again, no luck-they were two of thousands that fit the description. Comprehensive disaster investigations mean increased safety. They mean positive change. NASA knows it. The NTSB knows it. Does FEMA know it? No. **Fire Engineering has good reason to believe that the \"official investigation\" blessed by FEMA and run by the American Society of Civil Engineers is a half-baked farce that may already have been commandeered by political forces whose primary interests, to put it mildly, lie far afield of full disclosure.** Except for the marginal benefit obtained from a three-day, visual walk-through of evidence sites conducted by ASCE investigation committee members- described by one close source as a \"tourist trip\"-no one's checking the evidence for anything. Maybe we should live and work in planes. That way, if disaster strikes, we will at least be sure that a thorough investigation will help find ways to increase safety for our survivors. As things now stand and if they continue in such fashion, the investigation into the World Trade Center fire and collapse will amount to paper- and computer-generated hypotheticals. However, **respected members of the fire protection engineering community are beginning to raise red flags, and a resonating theory has emerged: The structural damage from the planes and the explosive ignition of jet fuel in themselves were not enough to bring down the towers.** Rather, theory has it, the subsequent contents fires attacking the questionably fireproofed lightweight trusses and load-bearing columns directly caused the collapses in an alarmingly short time.

Of course, in light of there being no real evidence thus far produced, this could remain just unexplored theory. The frequency of published and unpublished reports raising questions about the steel fireproofing and other fire protection elements in the buildings, as well as their design and construction, is on the rise. The builders and owners of the World Trade Center property, the Port Authority of New York-New Jersey, a governmental agency that operates in an accountability vacuum beyond the reach of local fire and building codes, has denied charges that the buildings' fire protection or construction components were substandard but has refused to cooperate with requests for documentation supporting its contentions. Some citizens are taking to the streets to protest the investigation sellout. Sally Regenhard, for one, wants to know why and how the building fell as it did upon her unfortunate son Christian, an FDNY probationary firefighter. And so do we. Clearly, there are burning questions that need answers. Based on the incident's magnitude alone, a full-throttle, fully resourced, forensic investigation is imperative. More important, from a moral standpoint, for the safety of present and future generations who live and work in tall buildings-and for firefighters, always first in and last out-the lessons about the buildings' design and behavior in this extraordinary event must be learned and applied in the real world. To treat the September 11 incident any differently would be the height of stupidity and ignorance. The destruction and removal of evidence must stop immediately. The federal government must scrap the current setup and commission a fully resourced blue ribbon panel to conduct a clean and thorough investigation of the fire and collapse, leaving no stones unturned.

Zalmay Khalilzad, who was born in Afghanistan, has arrived in Kabul amid much publicity. As the representative of the country that put the new government in power, he has a highly influential position. In one of his first press conferences, Mr Khalilzad condemned the Taliban as sponsors of terrorism and vowed the US would continue the military campaign until they and their allies in Osama bin Laden's al-Qa'ida network are eradicated. But in 1997, as a paid adviser to the oil multinational Unocal, he took part in talks with Taliban officials regarding the possibility of building highly lucrative gas and oil pipelines. He had drawn up a risk analysis report for the project that would have exploited the natural reserves of the region, estimated to be the world's second largest after the Persian Gulf. At the same time, he urged the Clinton administration to take a softer line on the Taliban. By 1997 some of the regime's worst excesses had become public and Mr bin Laden was ensconced in Afghanistan. That year, the Secretary of State, Madeleine Albright, described the Taliban's abuses of human rights as \"despicable\". But Mr Khalilzad defended them in The Washington Post. \"The Taliban do not practice the anti-US style of fundamentalism practised by Iran,\" he wrote. \"We should ... be willing to offer recognition and humanitarian assistance and to promote international economic reconstruction. It is time for the United States to re-engage.\" Without such \"re-engagement\", it would not have been possible for Unocal to pursue its goal to build a gas pipeline from the landlocked former Soviet republic of Turkmenistan through Afghanistan into Pakistan, with a possible extension to India. Unocal had been involved in a commercial war for the pipeline concession with the Argentinian company Bridas. As well as Mr Khalilzad - who had been an undersecretary of defence under George Bush Snr and has worked as a defence analyst for the Rand Corporation - Unocal hired a string of high-profile names with connections to the region to fight its cause, including Robert Oakley, the former US ambassador", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:020110independent.txt:0:8c574531fd68", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 6939, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "020110independent.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "020110independent", "chunk_index": 1, "text": "Turkmenistan through Afghanistan into Pakistan, with a possible extension to India.

American policy towards Afghanistan was increasingly being criticised because it seemed to be guided by oil and gas interests. That changed in August 1998, when the US embassies in Kenya and Tanzania were bombed and Washington blamed Mr bin Laden for the attacks. Unocal concluded that its pipeline was no longer tenable as long as the Taliban were in power. At that point Mr Khalilzad, too, changed his tune. In a highly influential article published in the Winter 2000 edition of The Washington Quarterly, an academic journal, he laid out what were to become the founding principles of the Bush administration's war in Afghanistan. Engagement with the Taliban was no longer possible, he argued: indeed, the sanctuary given to Mr bin Laden posed a grave threat to US interests at home and abroad. Opposition to the Taliban should be orchestrated through both the Northern Alliance and anti-Taliban Pashtun groups, with talks on a successor regime channelled through the former king, Zahir Shah, in Rome. Largely thanks to that article and the success of the war based on its premises, Mr Khalilzad has become an influential adviser to President Bush. His credibility relies to a large extent on his birth. He was born 50 years ago in Mazar-i-Sharif and brought up in Kabul as part of Afghanistan's Dari-speaking elite, before travelling to Lebanon and then to the US in the 1970s to complete his education in political science. His many critics point out that he has been wrong as often as he has been right - going back to the 1980s when, as a state department official in the Reagan administration, he argued vociferously in favour of providing surface-to-air missiles and other sophisticated weaponry to the very mujahedin groups that later gave birth to the Taliban. \"If he was in private business rather than government, he would have been sacked long ago,\" Anatol Lieven, an analyst with the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace in Washington, said. Such criticisms, and the possible conflict of interest arising from Mr Khalilzad's former role in Unocal, perhaps explains why he was appointed to the National Security Council, a position that did not require confirmation hearings in the Senate. Even now, his oil contacts are bound to raise suspicions about both his priorities and those of the Bush administration.

Even now, his oil contacts are bound to raise suspicions about both his priorities and those of the Bush administration. At the NSC, Mr Khalilzad worked for the National Security Adviser, Condoleezza Rice, who had served on the board of the Chevron Corporation as an expert on another central Asian state with major oil reserves, Kazakhstan. President Bush and Vice-president Dick Cheney have extensive backgrounds in the oil business, too, and it will not be lost on any of them that central Asia has almost 40 per cent of the world's gas reserves and 6 per cent of its oil reserves. In addition, Mr Khalilzad has links to the most hawkish wing of the administration. In the 1980s, he worked on Afghanistan alongside Paul Wolfowitz, now the Deputy Secretary of Defence and an ardent advocate of military action to depose Saddam Hussein in Iraq - a hardline view that has also sometimes been voiced by Mr Khalilzhad.

O'Neill, who lost his life at the World Trade Center on September 11th**, begins with a story by Richard A. Clarke, the national coördinator for counter-terrorism in the White House from the first Bush Administration until last year. On a Sunday morning in February, 1995, Clarke went to his office to review intelligence cables that had come in over the weekend. One of the cables reported that Ramzi Yousef, the suspected mastermind behind the first World Trade Center bombing, two years earlier, had been spotted in Pakistan. Clarke immediately called the F.B.I. A man whose voice was unfamiliar to him answered the phone. \"O'Neill,\" he growled. \"Who are you?\" Clarke said. \"I'm John O'Neill,\" the man replied. \"Who the hell are you?\" O'Neill had just been appointed chief of the F.B.I.'s counter-terrorism section, in Washington. He was forty-two years old, and had been transferred from the bureau's Chicago office. After driving all night, he had gone directly to headquarters that Sunday morning without dropping off his bags. When he heard Clarke's report about Yousef, O'Neill entered the F.B.I.'s Strategic Information Operations Center (SIOC) and telephoned Thomas Pickard, the head of the bureau's National Security Division in New York. Pickard then called Mary Jo White, the United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York, who had indicted Yousef in the bombing case. One of O'Neill's new responsibilities was to put together a team to bring the suspect home. It was composed of agents who were working on the case, a State Department representative, a medical doctor, a hostage-rescue team, and a fingerprint expert whose job was to make sure that the suspect was, in fact, Ramzi Yousef. Under ordinary circumstances, the host country would be asked to detain the suspect until extradition paperwork had been signed and the F.B.I. could place the man in custody. There was no time for that. Yousef was reportedly preparing to board a bus", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:020114johnoneillfbi911wtcsecurity.txt:0:2a1539fa207f", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 6942, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "020114johnoneillfbi911wtcsecurity.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "020114johnoneillfbi911wtcsecurity", "chunk_index": 1, "text": "was composed of agents who were working on the case, a State Department representative, a medical doctor, a hostage-rescue team, and a fingerprint expert whose job was to make sure that the suspect was, in fact, Ramzi Yousef. Under ordinary circumstances, the host country would be asked to detain the suspect until extradition paperwork had been signed and the F.B.I. could place the man in custody. There was no time for that. Yousef was reportedly preparing to board a bus for Peshawar. Unless he was apprehended, he would soon cross the Khyber Pass into Afghanistan, where he would be out of reach. There was only one F.B.I. agent in Pakistan at the time, along with several agents from the Drug Enforcement Administration and the State Department's diplomatic-security bureau. \"Our Ambassador had to get in his car and go ripping across town to get the head of the local military intelligence,\" Clarke recalled. \"The chief gave him his own personal aides, and this ragtag bunch of American law-enforcement officials and a couple of Pakistani soldiers set off to catch Yousef before he got on the bus.\" O'Neill, working around the clock for the next three days, coördinated the entire effort. At 10 A.M. Pakistan time, on Tuesday, February 7th, SIOC was informed that the World Trade Center bomber was in custody. **During the next six years, O'Neill became the bureau's most committed tracker of Osama bin Laden and his Al Qaeda network of terrorists as they struck against American interests around the world.** Brash, ambitious, often full of himself, O'Neill had a confrontational personality that brought him powerful enemies. Even so, he was too valuable to ignore. He was the point man in the investigation of the terrorist attacks in Saudi Arabia, East Africa, and Yemen. At a time when the Clinton Administration was struggling to decide how to respond to the terrorist threat, O'Neill, along with others in the F.B.I. and the C.I.A., realized that Al Qaeda was relentless and resourceful and that its ultimate target was America itself. In the last days of his life, after he had taken a new job as the chief of security for the World Trade Center, he was warning friends, \"We're due.\" \"I am the F.B.I.,\" John O'Neill liked to boast. He had wanted to work for the bureau since boyhood, when he watched Efrem Zimbalist, Jr., as the buttoned-down Inspector Lewis Erskine in the TV series \"The F.B.I.\" O'Neill was born in 1952 and brought up in Atlantic City, where his mother drove a cab for a small taxi business that she and his father owned. After graduating from Holy Spirit High School, he got a job as a fingerprint clerk with the F.B.I. During his first semester in college, he married his high-school sweetheart, Christine, and when he was twenty their son, John P. O'Neill, Jr., was born. O'Neill put himself", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:020114johnoneillfbi911wtcsecurity.txt:1:6a32ce69da50", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 6943, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "020114johnoneillfbi911wtcsecurity.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "020114johnoneillfbi911wtcsecurity", "chunk_index": 2, "text": "in the TV series \"The F.B.I.\" O'Neill was born in 1952 and brought up in Atlantic City, where his mother drove a cab for a small taxi business that she and his father owned. After graduating from Holy Spirit High School, he got a job as a fingerprint clerk with the F.B.I. During his first semester in college, he married his high-school sweetheart, Christine, and when he was twenty their son, John P. O'Neill, Jr., was born. O'Neill put himself through a master's program in forensics at George Washington University by serving as a tour guide at the F.B.I. headquarters. In 1976, he became a full-time agent in the bureau's office in Baltimore; ten years later, he returned to headquarters and served as an inspector. In 1991, he was named assistant special agent in charge in the Chicago office. In 1994, he received the additional assignment of supervising VAPCON, a national investigation into violence against abortion providers. The following year, he transferred to headquarters to become the counter-terrorism chief. John Lipka, an agent who met O'Neill during the VAPCON probe, marvelled at his ability to move so easily from investigating organized crime and official corruption to the thornier field of counter-terrorism. \"He was a very quick study,\" Lipka told me. \"I'd been working terrorism since '86, but he'd walk out of the Hoover building, flag a cab, and I'd brief him on the way to the White House. Then he'd give a presentation, and I'd be shocked that he grasped everything I had been working on for weeks.\" O'Neill entered the bureau in the J. Edgar Hoover era, and throughout his career he had something of the old-time G-man about him. He talked tough, in a New Jersey accent that many loved to imitate. He was darkly handsome, with black eyes and slicked-back hair. In a culture that favors discreet anonymity, he cut a memorable figure. He favored fine cigars and Chivas Regal and water with a twist, and carried a nine-millimetre automatic strapped to his ankle. His manner was bluff and dominating, but he was always immaculately, even fussily, dressed. One of his colleagues in Washington took note of O'Neill's \"night-club wardrobe\"-black double-breasted suits, semitransparent black socks, and ballet-slipper shoes. \"He had very delicate feet and hands, and, with his polished fingernails, he made quite an impression.\" In Washington, O'Neill became part of a close-knit group of counter-terrorism experts which formed around Richard Clarke. In the web of federal agencies concerned with terrorism, Clarke was the spider. Everything that touched the web eventually came to his attention. The members of this inner circle, which was known as the Counter-terrorism Security Group (C.S.G.), were drawn mainly from the C.I.A., the National Security Council, and the upper tiers of the Defense Department, the Justice Department, and the State Department. They met every week in the White House Situation Room. \"John could", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:020114johnoneillfbi911wtcsecurity.txt:2:91bd029e2c4a", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 6944, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "020114johnoneillfbi911wtcsecurity.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "020114johnoneillfbi911wtcsecurity", "chunk_index": 3, "text": "which formed around Richard Clarke.

The members of this inner circle, which was known as the Counter-terrorism Security Group (C.S.G.), were drawn mainly from the C.I.A., the National Security Council, and the upper tiers of the Defense Department, the Justice Department, and the State Department. They met every week in the White House Situation Room. \"John could lead a discussion at that level,\" R. P. Eddy, who was an N.S.C. director at the time, told me. \"He was not just the guy you turned to for a situation report. He was the guy who would say the thing that everybody in the room wishes he had said.\" In July of 1996, when T.W.A. Flight 800 crashed off the coast of Long Island, there was widespread speculation in the C.S.G. that it had been shot down by a shoulder-fired missile from the shore. Dozens of witnesses reported having seen an ascending flare that culminated in an explosion. According to Clarke, O'Neill, working with the Defense Department, determined the height of the aircraft and its distance from shore at the time of the explosion, and demonstrated that it was out of the range of a Stinger missile. He proposed that the flare could have been caused by the ignition of leaking fuel from the aircraft, and he persuaded the C.I.A. to do a video simulation of this scenario, which proved to be strikingly similar to the witnesses' accounts. It is now generally agreed that mechanical failure, not terrorism, caused the explosion of T.W.A. Flight 800. Clarke immediately spotted in O'Neill an obsessiveness about the dangers of terrorism which mirrored his own. \"John had the same problems with the bureaucracy that I had,\" Clarke told me. \"Prior to September 11th, a lot of people who were working full time on terrorism thought it was no more than a nuisance. They didn't understand that Al Qaeda was enormously powerful and insidious and that it was not going to stop until it really hurt us. John and some other senior officials knew that. The impatience really grew in us as we dealt with the dolts who didn't understand.\" Osama bin Laden had been linked to terrorism since the first World Trade Center bombing, in 1993. His name had turned up on a list of donors to an Islamic charity that helped finance the bombing, and defendants in the case referred to a \"Sheikh Osama\" in a recorded conversation. \"We started looking at who was involved in these events, and it seemed like an odd group of people getting together,\" Clarke recalled. \"They clearly had money. We'd see C.I.A. reports that referred to 'financier Osama bin Laden,' and we'd ask ourselves, 'Who the hell is he?' The more we drilled down, the more", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:020114johnoneillfbi911wtcsecurity.txt:3:deb233f9b66b", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 6945, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "020114johnoneillfbi911wtcsecurity.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "020114johnoneillfbi911wtcsecurity", "chunk_index": 4, "text": "list of donors to an Islamic charity that helped finance the bombing, and defendants in the case referred to a \"Sheikh Osama\" in a recorded conversation. \"We started looking at who was involved in these events, and it seemed like an odd group of people getting together,\" Clarke recalled. \"They clearly had money. We'd see C.I.A. reports that referred to 'financier Osama bin Laden,' and we'd ask ourselves, 'Who the hell is he?' The more we drilled down, the more we realized that he was not just a financier-he was the leader. John said, 'We've got to get this guy. He's building a network. Everything leads back to him.' Gradually, the C.I.A. came along with us.\" O'Neill worked with Clarke to establish clear lines of responsibility among the intelligence agencies, and in 1995 their efforts resulted in a Presidential directive giving the F.B.I. the lead authority both in investigating and in preventing acts of terrorism wherever Americans or American interests were threatened. After the April, 1995, bombing in Oklahoma City, O'Neill formed a separate section for domestic terrorism, but he concentrated on redesigning and expanding the foreign-terrorism branch. He organized a swap of deputies between his office and the C.I.A.'s counter-terrorism center, despite resistance from both agencies. \"John told me that if you put the resources and talents of the C.I.A.'s counter-terrorism center and the F.B.I.'s counter-terrorism section together on any issue, we can solve it-but we need both,\" Lipka recalled. In January, 1996, O'Neill helped create a C.I.A. station, code-named Alex, with a single-minded purpose. \"Its mission was not just tracking down bin Laden but focussing on his infrastructure, his capabilities, where he got his funding, where were his bases of operation and his training centers,\" Lipka said. \"Many of the same things we are doing now, that station was already doing then.\" The coöperation that O'Neill achieved between the bureau and the C.I.A. was all the more remarkable because opinions about him were sharply polarized. O'Neill could be brutal, not only with underlings but also with superiors when they failed to meet his expectations. An agent in the Chicago office who felt his disapproval told me, \"He was smarter than everybody else, and he would use that fine mind to absolutely humiliate people.\" In Washington, there was one terrorist-related crisis after another. \"We worked a bomb a month,\" Lipka recalled. Often, O'Neill would break for dinner and be back in the office at ten. \"Most people couldn't keep up with his passion and intensity,\" Lipka said. \"He was able to identify those people who shared his work ethic, and then he tasked the living shit out of them, with E-mails and status briefings and phones and pagers going off all the time, to the point that I asked him, 'When do you sleep?' \" O'Neill began acquiring nicknames that testified to his relentlessness, among them the Count, the", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:020114johnoneillfbi911wtcsecurity.txt:4:7ae042b650d3", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 6946, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "020114johnoneillfbi911wtcsecurity.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "020114johnoneillfbi911wtcsecurity", "chunk_index": 5, "text": "back in the office at ten. \"Most people couldn't keep up with his passion and intensity,\" Lipka said. \"He was able to identify those people who shared his work ethic, and then he tasked the living shit out of them, with E-mails and status briefings and phones and pagers going off all the time, to the point that I asked him, 'When do you sleep?' \" O'Neill began acquiring nicknames that testified to his relentlessness, among them the Count, the Prince of Darkness, and Satan. But many in the bureau who disliked O'Neill eventually became devoted followers. He went to extraordinary lengths to help when they faced health problems or financial difficulty. \"He was our Elvis-you knew when he was in the house,\" Kevin Giblin, the F.B.I.'s head of terrorist warning, recalled. O'Neill's tenure in the F.B.I. coincided with the internationalization of crime and law enforcement. Prior to his appointment as the bureau's counter-terrorism chief, the F.B.I. had limited its involvement to operations in which Americans had been killed. \"O'Neill came in with a much more global approach,\" Lipka told me. One of his innovations was to catalogue all the explosives used by terrorists worldwide. \"He thought, When a bomb goes off in the Egyptian Embassy in Islamabad, even though no Americans were killed, why don't we offer our assistance, so that we can put that information on a global forensic database,\" Lipka said. Since 1984, the F.B.I. had had the authority to investigate crimes against Americans abroad, but that mandate had been handicapped by a lack of coöperation with foreign police agencies. O'Neill made a habit of entertaining every foreign cop or intelligence agent who entered his orbit. He called it his \"night job.\" \"John's approach to law enforcement was that of the old Irish ward boss to governance: you collect friendships and debts and obligations, because you never know when you're going to need them,\" Clarke told me. He was constantly on the phone, doing favors, massaging contacts. By the time he died, he had become one of the best-known policemen in the world. \"You'd be in Moscow at some bilateral exchange,\" Giblin recalled, \"and you'd see three or four men approach and say, in broken English, 'Do you know John O'Neill?' \" The need to improve relationships with foreign police agencies became apparent in November, 1995, when five Americans and two Indians died in the bombing of an American-run military-training center in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.

The F.B.I. sent over a small squad to investigate, but the agents had scarcely arrived when the Saudis arrested four suspects and beheaded them, foreclosing any opportunity to learn who was behind the operation. In the spring of 1996, Jamal Ahmed al-Fadl, who had supported a plot by Al Qaeda against American soldiers in Somalia four years earlier, arrived at the American Embassy in Asmara, Eritrea. The C.I.A. debriefed him for six months, then turned him over to the F.B.I., which put him in the witness-protection program. Fadl provided the first extensive road map of the bin Laden terrorist empire. \"Fadl was a gold mine,\" an intelligence source who was present during some of the interviews told me. \"He described the network, bin Laden's companies, his farms, his operations in the ports.\" Fadl also talked about bin Laden's desire to attack Americans, including his ambition to obtain uranium. The news was widely circulated among members of the intelligence community, including O'Neill, and yet the State Department refused to list Al Qaeda as a terrorist organization. On June 25, 1996, O'Neill arranged a retreat for F.B.I. and C.I.A. agents at the bureau's training center in Quantico, Virginia. \"We had hot dogs and hamburgers, and John let the C.I.A. guys on the firing range, because they never get to shoot,\" Giblin recalled. \"Then everyone's beeper went off.\" Another explosion in Saudi Arabia, at the Khobar Towers, a military-housing complex in Dhahran, had killed nineteen American soldiers and injured more than five hundred other people, including Saudis. O'Neill assembled a team of nearly a hundred agents, support personnel, and members of various police agencies. The next day, they were on an Air Force transport plane to Saudi Arabia. A few weeks later, they were joined by O'Neill and the F.B.I. director, Louis Freeh. It was evening when the two men arrived in Dhahran. The disaster site was a vast crater illuminated by lights on high stanchions; nearby lay charred automobiles and upended Humvees. Looming above the debris were the ruins of the housing complex. This was the largest bomb that the F.B.I. had ever investigated, even more powerful than the explosives that had killed a hundred and sixty-eight people in Oklahoma City in 1995. O'Neill walked through the rubble, greeting exhausted agents who were sifting the sand for evidence. Under a tarp nearby, investigators were gradually reconstructing fragments of the truck that had carried the bomb. In the Khobar Towers case, neither the Saudis nor the State Department seemed eager to pursue a trail of evidence that pointed to Iranian terrorists as the likeliest perpetrators. The Clinton Administration did not relish the prospect of military retaliation against a country that seemed to be moderating its anti-Western policies, and, according to Clarke, the Saudis impeded the F.B.I. investigation because they were worried about the American response.", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:020114johnoneillfbi911wtcsecurity.txt:6:bbc099b74c73", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 6948, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "020114johnoneillfbi911wtcsecurity.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "020114johnoneillfbi911wtcsecurity", "chunk_index": 7, "text": "gradually reconstructing fragments of the truck that had carried the bomb.

I think they're really going to help us.' And John says, 'You've got to be kidding. They didn't give us anything. They were just shining sunshine up your ass.' For the next twelve hours, Freeh didn't say another word to him.\" Freeh denies that this conversation took place. \"Of course, John and I discussed the results of every trip at that time,\" he wrote to me in an E-mail. \"However, John never made that statement to me. . . . John and I had an excellent relationship based on trust and friendship.\" O'Neill longed to get out of Washington so that he could \"go operational,\" as he told John Lipka, and supervise cases again. In January, 1997, he became special agent in charge of the National Security Division in New York, the bureau's largest and most prestigious field office. When he arrived, he dumped four boxes of Rolodex cards on the desk of his new secretary, Lorraine di Taranto. Then he handed her a list of everyone he wanted to meet-\"the mayor, the police commissioner, the deputy police commissioners, the heads of the federal agencies, religious and ethnic leaders,\" di Taranto recalled. Within six months, O'Neill had met everyone on the list. \"Everybody knew John,\" R. P. Eddy, who left Washington in 1999 for a job at the United Nations, told me. \"You would walk into Elaine's or Bruno's with him, and everyone from the owner to the waiters to the guy who cleaned the floor would look up.

One of the wait staff was applying for a job with the bureau, and John would be helping him with that. After a night of this, I remember saying, 'John, you've got this town wired.' And he said, 'What's the point of being sheriff if you can't act like one?' \" O'Neill was soon on intimate terms with movie stars, politicians, and journalists-what some of his detractors called \"the Elaine's crowd.\" In the spring of 1998, one of O'Neill's New York friends, a producer at ABC News named Christopher Isham, arranged an interview for a network reporter, John Miller, with Osama bin Laden. Miller's narration contained information to the effect that one of bin Laden's aides was coöperating with the F.B.I. The leak of that detail created, in Isham's words, \"a firestorm in the bureau.\" O'Neill, because of his friendship with Isham and Miller, was suspected of providing the information, and an internal investigation was launched. The matter died down after the newsmen denied that O'Neill was their informant and volunteered to take polygraphs. In New York, O'Neill created a special Al Qaeda desk, and when the bombings of the American embassies in Kenya and Tanzania occurred, in August, 1998, he was sure that bin Laden was behind them. \"He was pissed, he was beside himself,\" Robert M. Blitzer, who was head of the F.B.I.'s domestic-terrorism section at the time, remembered. \"He was calling me every day. He wanted control of that investigation.\" O'Neill persuaded Freeh to let the New York office handle the case, and he eventually dispatched nearly five hundred investigators to Africa. Mary Jo White, whose prosecuting team subsequently convicted five defendants in the case, told me, \"John O'Neill, in the investigation of the bombings of our embassies in East Africa, created the template for successful investigations of international terrorism around the world.\" The counter-terrorist community was stunned by the level of coördination required to pull off the simultaneous bombings. Even more troubling was the escalation of violence against civilians. According to Steven Simon, then a terrorist expert at the N.S.C., as many as five American embassies had been targeted-luck and better intelligence had saved the others. It was discouraging to learn that, nearly a year before, a member of Al Qaeda had walked into the American Embassy in Nairobi and told the C.I.A. of the bombing plot. The agency had dismissed this intelligence as unreliable. \"The guy was a bullshit artist, completely off the map,\" an intelligence source said.

The agency had dismissed this intelligence as unreliable. \"The guy was a bullshit artist, completely off the map,\" an intelligence source said. But his warnings about the impending attacks proved accurate. Moreover, key members of the Al Qaeda cell that planned the operation had been living in one of the most difficult places in the Western world to gain intelligence: the United States. The F.B.I. is constrained from spying on American citizens and visitors without probable cause. Lacking evidence that potential conspirators were actively committing a crime, the bureau could do little to gather information on the domestic front. O'Neill felt that his hands were tied. \"John was never satisfied,\" one of his friends in the bureau recalled. \"He said we were fighting a war, but we were not able to fight back. He thought we never had the tools in place to do the job.\" O'Neill never presumed that killing bin Laden alone would be sufficient. In speeches, he identified five tools to combat terrorism: diplomacy, military action, covert operations, economic sanctions, and law enforcement. So far, the tool that had worked most effectively against Al Qaeda was the last one-the slow, difficult work of gathering evidence, getting indictments, hunting down the perpetrators, and gaining convictions. O'Neill was worried that terrorists had established a beachhead in America. In a June, 1997, speech in Chicago, he warned, \"Almost all of the groups today, if they chose to, have the ability to strike us here in the United States.\" He was particularly concerned that, as the millennium approached, Al Qaeda would seize the moment to dramatize its war with America. The intelligence to support that hypothesis was frustratingly absent, however. On December 14, 1999, a border guard in Port Angeles, Washington, stopped an Algerian man, Ahmed Ressam, who then bolted from his car. He was captured as he tried to hijack another automobile. In the trunk of his car were four timers, more than a hundred pounds of urea, and fourteen pounds of sulfate-the makings of an Oklahoma City-type bomb. It turned out that Ressam's target was Los Angeles International Airport. The following day, Jordanian authorities arrested thirteen suspected terrorists who were believed to be planning to blow up a Radisson Hotel in Amman and a number of tourist sites frequented by Westerners. The Jordanians also discovered an Al Qaeda training manual on CD-ROM. What followed was, according to Clarke, the most comprehensive investigation ever conducted before September 11th. O'Neill's job was to supervise the operation in New York.

O'Neill's job was to supervise the operation in New York. Authorities had found several phone numbers on Ressam when he was arrested. There was also a name, Ghani, which belonged to Abdel Ghani Meskini, an Algerian, who lived in Brooklyn and who had travelled to Seattle to meet with Ressam. O'Neill oversaw the stakeout of Meskini's residence and spent much of his time in the Brooklyn command post. \"I doubt he slept the whole month,\" David N. Kelley, an assistant United States Attorney and chief of organized crime and terrorism for the Southern District, recalled. A wiretap picked up a call that Meskini had made to Algeria in which he spoke about Ressam and a suspected terrorist in Montreal. On December 30th, O'Neill arrested Meskini on conspiracy charges and a number of other suspected terrorists on immigration violations. (Meskini and Ressam eventually became coöperating witnesses and are both assisting the F.B.I.'s investigation of the September 11th attacks.) O'Neill was proud of the efforts of the F.B.I. and the New York Joint Terrorism Task Force to avert catastrophe. On New Year's Eve, he and his friend Joseph Dunne, then the Chief of Department for the New York City Police, went to Times Square, which they believed was a highly likely target. At midnight, O'Neill called friends at SIOC and boasted that he was standing directly under the giant crystal ball. After the millennium roundup, O'Neill suspected that Al Qaeda had sleeper cells buried in America. \"He started pulling the strings in Jordan and in Canada, and in the end they all led back to the United States,\" Clarke said. \"There was a general disbelief in the F.B.I. that Al Qaeda had much of a presence here. It just hadn't sunk through to the organization, beyond O'Neill and Dale Watson\"-the assistant director of the counter-terrorism division. Clarke's discussions with O'Neill and Watson over the next few months led to a strategic plan called the Millennium After-Action Review, which specified a number of policy changes designed to root out Al Qaeda cells in the United States. They included increasing the number of Joint Terrorism Task Forces around the country; assigning more agents from the Internal Revenue Service and the Immigration and Naturalization Service to monitor the flow of money and personnel; and creating a streamlined process for analyzing information obtained from wiretaps. Many in the F.B.I. point to the millennium investigation as one of the bureau's great recent successes. **A year earlier, O'Neill had been passed over when the position of assistant", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:020114johnoneillfbi911wtcsecurity.txt:10:42b04ef494ec", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 6952, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "020114johnoneillfbi911wtcsecurity.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "020114johnoneillfbi911wtcsecurity", "chunk_index": 11, "text": "in the United States.

Many in the F.B.I. point to the millennium investigation as one of the bureau's great recent successes. **A year earlier, O'Neill had been passed over when the position of assistant director in charge of national security became available.** When the post of chief of the New York office opened up, in early 2000, O'Neill lobbied fiercely for it. The job went to Barry Mawn, a former special agent in charge of the Boston office. As it happened, the two men met at a seminar just after the decision was announced. \"I got a knock on the door, and there was John holding two beers,\" Mawn recalled. O'Neill promised complete loyalty in return for Mawn's support of his work on counter-terrorism. \"It turns out that supporting him was a full-time job,\" Mawn said. O'Neill had many detractors and very few defenders left in Washington. Despite occasional disagreements, Louis Freeh had always supported O'Neill, but Freeh had announced that he would retire in June, 2001. A friend of O'Neill's, Jerry Hauer, of the New York-based security firm Kroll, told me that Thomas Pickard, who had become the bureau's deputy director in 1999, was \"an institutional roadblock.\" Hauer added, \"It was very clear to John that Pickard was never going to let him get promoted.\" Others felt that O'Neill was his own worst enemy. \"He was always trying to leverage himself to the next job,\" Dale Watson said. John Lipka, who considers himself a close friend of O'Neill, attributes some of O'Neill's problems to his flamboyant image. \"The bureau doesn't like high-profile people,\" he said. \"It's a very conservative culture.\" The World Trade Center had become a symbol of America's success in fighting terrorism, and in September, 2000, the New York Joint Terrorism Task Force celebrated its twentieth anniversary in the Windows on the World restaurant. The event was attended by representatives of seventeen law-enforcement agencies, including agents from the F.B.I. and the C.I.A., New York City and Port Authority policemen, United States marshals, and members of the Secret Service. Mary Jo White praised the task force for a \"close to absolutely perfect record of successful investigations and convictions.\" White had served eight years as the United States Attorney for the Southern District, and she had convicted twenty-five Islamic terrorists, including Yousef, six other World Trade Center bombers, the blind cleric Sheikh Omar Abdel Rahman, and nine of Rahman's followers, who had planned to blow up the Lincoln and Holland Tunnels, the United Nations headquarters, and the F.B.I. offices.

O'Neill seemed at ease that night. Few of his colleagues knew of a troubling incident that had occurred two months earlier at an F.B.I. pre-retirement conference in Orlando. During a meeting, O'Neill had been paged. He left the room to return the call, and when he came back, a few minutes later, the other agents had broken for lunch. His briefcase, which contained classified material, was missing. O'Neill immediately called the local police, and they found the briefcase a couple of hours later, in another hotel. A Montblanc pen had been stolen, along with a silver cigar cutter and a lighter. The papers were intact; fingerprint analysis soon established that they had not been touched. \"He phoned me and said, 'I gotta tell you something,' \" Barry Mawn recalled. O'Neill told Mawn that the briefcase contained some classified E-mails and one highly sensitive document, the Annual Field Office Report, which is an overview of every counter-terrorist and counter-espionage case in New York. Mawn reported the incident to Neil Gallagher, the bureau's assistant director in charge of national security. \"John understood the seriousness of what he had done, and if he were alive today he'd tell you he made a stupid mistake,\" Gallagher told me. Even though none of the information had been compromised, the Justice Department ordered a criminal inquiry. Mawn said that, as O'Neill's supervisor, he would have recommended an oral reprimand or, at worst, a letter of censure. Despite their competition for the top job in New York, Mawn had become one of O'Neill's staunchest defenders. \"He demanded perfection, which was a large part of why the New York office is so terrific,\" Mawn said. \"But underneath his manner, deep down, he was very insecure.\" On October 12, 2000, a small boat filled with C4 explosives motored alongside a U.S. destroyer, the Cole, which was fuelling up off the coast of Yemen. Two men aboard the small craft waved at the larger vessel, then blew themselves to pieces. Seventeen American sailors died, and thirty-nine others were seriously wounded. O'Neill knew that Yemen was going to be an extremely difficult place in which to conduct an investigation. In 1992, bin Laden's network had bombed a hotel in Aden, hoping to kill a number of American soldiers. The country was filled with spies and with jihadis and was reeling from a 1994 civil war. \"Yemen is a country of eighteen million citizens and 50 million machine guns,\" O'Neill reported.

The country was filled with spies and with jihadis and was reeling from a 1994 civil war. \"Yemen is a country of eighteen million citizens and 50 million machine guns,\" O'Neill reported. On the day the investigators arrived in Yemen, O'Neill warned them, \"This may be the most hostile environment the F.B.I. has ever operated in.\" The American Ambassador to Yemen, Barbara Bodine, saw things differently. In her eyes, Yemen was the poor and guileless cousin of the swaggering petro-monarchies of the Persian Gulf. Unlike other countries in the region, it was a constitutional democracy-however fragile-in which women were allowed to vote. Bodine had had extensive experience in Arab countries. During the Iraqi invasion and occupation of Kuwait, she had been the deputy chief of mission in Kuwait City, and she had stayed through the hundred-and-thirty-seven-day siege of the American Embassy by Iraqi troops until all the Americans were evacuated. Bodine, who is on assignment from the State Department as diplomat-in-residence at the University of California at Santa Barbara, contends that she and O'Neill had agreed that he would bring in a team of no more than fifty. She was furious when three hundred investigators, support staff, and marines arrived, many carrying automatic weapons. \"Try to imagine if a military plane from another country landed in Des Moines, and three hundred heavily armed people took over,\" she told me recently. Bodine recalled that she pleaded with O'Neill to consider the delicate diplomatic environment he was entering. She quoted him as responding, \"We don't care about the environment. We're just here to investigate a crime.\" \"There was the F.B.I. way, and that was it,\" she said to me. \"O'Neill wasn't unique. He was simply extreme.\" According to Michael Sheehan, who was the State Department's coördinator for counter-terrorism at the time, such conflicts between ambassadors and the bureau are not unusual, given their differing perspectives; however, Bodine had been given clear instructions from the outset of the investigation. \"I drafted a cable under [then Secretary of State] Madeleine Albright's signature saying that there were three guiding principles,\" Sheehan said. \"The highest priorities were the immediate safety of American personnel and the investigation of the attack. No. 3 was maintaining a relationship with the government of Yemen- but only to support those objectives.\" O'Neill's investigators were billeted three or four to a room in an Aden hotel. \"Forty-five F.B.I. personnel slept on mats on the ballroom floor,\" he later reported. He set up a command post on the eighth floor, which was surrounded by sandbags and protected by a company of fifty marines.

He set up a command post on the eighth floor, which was surrounded by sandbags and protected by a company of fifty marines. O'Neill spent much of his time coaxing the Yemeni authorities to coöperate. To build a case that would hold up in American courts, he wanted his agents present during interrogations by local authorities, in part to insure that none of the suspects were tortured. He also wanted to gather eyewitness testimony from residents who had seen the explosion. Both the Yemeni authorities and Bodine resisted these requests. \"You want a bunch of six-foot-two Irish-Americans to go door-to-door?\" Bodine remembers saying to O'Neill. \"And, excuse me, but how many of your guys speak Arabic?\" There were only half a dozen Arabic speakers in the F.B.I. contingent, and even O'Neill acknowledged that their competence was sometimes in question. On one occasion, he complained to a Yemeni intelligence officer, \"Getting information out of you is like pulling teeth.\" When his comment was translated, the Yemeni's eyes widened. The translator had told him, \"If you don't give me the information I want, I'm going to pull out your teeth.\" When O'Neill expressed his frustration to Washington, President Clinton sent a note to President Ali Abdullah Saleh. It had little effect. According to agents on the scene, O'Neill's people were never given the authority they needed for a proper investigation. Much of their time was spent on board the Cole, interviewing sailors, or lounging around the sweltering hotel. Some of O'Neill's requests for evidence mystified the Yemenis. They couldn't understand, for instance, why he was demanding a hat worn by one of the conspirators, which O'Neill wanted to examine for DNA evidence. Even the harbor sludge, which contained residue from the bomb, was off limits until the bureau paid the Yemeni government a million dollars to dredge it. There were so many perceived threats that the agents often slept in their clothes and with their guns at their sides. Bodine thought that much of this fear was overblown. \"They were deeply suspicious of everyone, including the hotel staff,\" she told me. She assured O'Neill that gunfire outside the hotel was probably not directed at the investigators but was simply the noise of wedding celebrations. Still, she added that, for the investigators' own safety, she wanted to lower the bureau's profile by reducing the number of agents and stripping them of heavy weapons. Upon receiving a bomb threat, the investigators evacuated the hotel and moved to an American vessel, the U.S.S. Duluth. After that, they had to request permission just to come ashore.", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:020114johnoneillfbi911wtcsecurity.txt:14:e27dfdd22bf7", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 6956, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "020114johnoneillfbi911wtcsecurity.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "020114johnoneillfbi911wtcsecurity", "chunk_index": 15, "text": "assured O'Neill that gunfire outside the hotel was probably not directed at the investigators but was simply the noise of wedding celebrations.

Upon receiving a bomb threat, the investigators evacuated the hotel and moved to an American vessel, the U.S.S. Duluth. After that, they had to request permission just to come ashore. Relations between Bodine and O'Neill deteriorated to the point that Barry Mawn flew to Yemen to assess the situation. \"She represented that John was insulting, and not getting along well with the Yemenis,\" he recalled. Mawn talked to members of the F.B.I. team and American military officers, and he observed O'Neill's interactions with Yemeni authorities. He told O'Neill that he was doing \"an outstanding job.\" On Mawn's return, he reported favorably on O'Neill to Freeh, adding that Bodine was his \"only detractor.\" An ambassador, however, has authority over which Americans are allowed to stay in a foreign country. A month after the investigation began, Assistant Director Dale Watson told the Washington Post, \"Sustained cooperation\" with the Yemenis \"has enabled the F.B.I. to further reduce its in-country presence. . . . The F.B.I. will soon be able to bring home the F.B.I.'s senior on-scene commander, John O'Neill.\" It appeared to be a very public surrender. The same day, the Yemeni Prime Minister told the Post that no link had been discovered between the Cole bombers and Al Qaeda. The statement was premature, to say the least. In fact, it is possible that some of the planning for the Cole bombing and the September 11th attacks took place simultaneously. It is now believed that at least two of the suspected conspirators in the Cole bombing had attended a meeting of alleged bin Laden associates in Malaysia, in January, 2000. Under C.I.A. pressure, Malaysian authorities had conducted a surveillance of the gathering, turning up a number of faces but, in the absence of wiretaps, nothing of what was said. \"It didn't seem like much at the time,\" a Clinton Administration official told me. \"None of the faces showed up in our own files.\" Early last year, the F.B.I. targeted the men who were present at the Malaysia meeting as potential terrorists. Two of them were subsequently identified as hijackers in the September 11th attacks. **After two months in Yemen, O'Neill came home feeling that he was fighting the counter-terrorism battle without support from his own government.** He had made some progress in gaining access to evidence, but so far the investigation had been a failure.

She refuses to discuss that decision. \"Too much is being made of John O'Neill's being in Yemen or not,\" she told me. \"John O'Neill did not discover Al Qaeda. He did not discover Osama bin Laden. So the idea that John or his people or the F.B.I. were somehow barred from doing their job is insulting to the U.S. government, which was working on Al Qaeda before John ever showed up. This is all my embassy did for ten months. The fact that not every single thing John O'Neill asked for was appropriate or possible does not mean that we did not support the investigation.\" After O'Neill's departure, the remaining agents, feeling increasingly vulnerable, retreated to the American Embassy in Sanaa, the capital of Yemen. In June, the Yemeni authorities arrested eight men who they said were part of a plot to blow up the Embassy. New threats against the F.B.I. followed, and Freeh, acting upon O'Neill's recommendation, withdrew the team entirely. Its members were, he told me, \"the highest target during this period.\" Bodine calls the pullout \"unconscionable.\" In her opinion, there was never a specific, credible threat against the bureau. The American Embassy, Bodine points out, stayed open. But within days American military forces in the Middle East were put on top alert. Few people in the bureau knew that O'Neill had a wife and two children (John, Jr., and his younger sister, Carol) in New Jersey, who did not join him when he moved to Chicago, in 1991. In his New York office, the most prominent pictures were not family photographs but French Impressionist prints. On his coffee table was a book about tulips, and his office was always filled with flowers. He was a terrific dancer, and he boasted that he had been on \"American Bandstand\" when he was a teen-ager. Some women found him irresistibly sexy. Others thought him a cad. Shortly after he arrived in Chicago, O'Neill met Valerie James, a fashion sales director, who was divorced and was raising two children. Four years later, when he transferred to headquarters, in Washington, he also began seeing Anna DiBattista, who worked for a travel agency. Then, when he moved to New York, Valerie James joined him. In 1999, DiBattista moved to New York to take a new job, complicating his life considerably. His friends in Chicago and New York knew Valerie, and his friends in Washington knew Anna.

If his friends happened to see him in the company of the \"wrong\" woman, he pledged them to secrecy. On holidays, O'Neill went home to New Jersey to visit his parents and to see his children. Only John P. O'Neill, Jr., who is a computer expert for the credit-card company M.B.N.A., in Wilmington, Delaware, agreed to speak to me about his father. His remarks were guarded. He described a close relationship-\"We talked a few times a week\"-but there are parts of his father's past that he refuses to discuss. \"My father liked to keep his private life private,\" he said. Both James and DiBattista remember how O'Neill would beg for forgiveness and then promise better times. James told me, \"He'd say, 'I just want to be loved, just love me,' but you couldn't really trust him, so he never got the love he asked for.\" The stress of O'Neill's tangled personal life began to affect his professional behavior. One night, he left his Palm Pilot in Yankee Stadium; it was filled with his police contacts all around the world. On another occasion, he left his cell phone in a cab. In the summer of 1999, he and James were driving to the Jersey shore when his Buick broke down near the Meadowlands. As it happened, his bureau car was parked nearby, at a secret office location, and O'Neill switched cars. One of the most frequently violated rules in the bureau is the use of an official vehicle for personal reasons, and O'Neill's infraction might have been overlooked had he not let James enter the building to use the bathroom. \"I had no idea what it was,\" she told me. Still, when the F.B.I. learned about the violation, apparently from an agent who had been caught using the site as an auto-repair shop, O'Neill was reprimanded and docked fifteen days' pay. He regarded the bureau's action as part of a pattern. \"The last two years of his life, he got very paranoid,\" James told me. \"He was convinced there were people out to get him.\" In March, 2001, Richard Clarke asked the national-security adviser, Condoleezza Rice, for a job change; he wanted to concentrate on computer security. \"I was told, 'You've got to recommend somebody similar to be your replacement,' \" Clarke recalled. \"I said, 'Well, there's only one person who would fit that bill.' \" For months, Clarke tried to persuade O'Neill to become a candidate as his successor.

O'Neill had always harbored two aspirations-to become a deputy director of the bureau in Washington or to take over the New York office. Freeh was retiring in June, so there were likely to be some vacancies at the top, but the investigation into the briefcase incident would likely block any promotion in the bureau. O'Neill viewed Clarke's job as, in many ways, a perfect fit for him. But he was financially pressed, and Clarke's job paid no more than he was making at the F.B.I. Throughout the summer, O'Neill refused to commit himself to Clarke's offer. He talked about it with a number of friends but became alarmed when he thought that headquarters might hear of it. \"He called me in a worked-up state,\" Clarke recalled. \"He said that people in the C.I.A. and elsewhere know you are considering recommending me for your job. You have to tell them it's not true.\" Clarke dutifully called a friend in the agency, even though O'Neill still wanted to be a candidate for the position. **In July, O'Neill heard of a job opening in the private sector which would pay more than twice his government salary-that of chief of security for the World Trade Center. Although the Justice Department dropped its inquiry into the briefcase incident, the bureau was conducting an internal investigation of its own. O'Neill was aware that the Times was preparing a story about the affair, and he learned that the reporters also knew about the incident in New Jersey involving James and had classified information that probably came from the bureau's investigative files.The leak seemed to be timed to destroy O'Neill's chance of being confirmed for the N.S.C. job. He decided to retire.** O'Neill suspected that the source of the information was either Tom Pickard or Dale Watson. The antagonism between him and Pickard was well known. \"I've got a pretty good Irish temper and so did John,\" Pickard, who retired last November, told me. But he insisted that their differences were professional, not personal. The leak was \"somebody being pretty vicious to John,\" but Pickard maintained that he did not do it. \"I'd take a polygraph to it,\" he said. Watson told me, \"If you're asking me who leaks F.B.I. information, I have no idea. I know I don't, and I know that Tom Pickard doesn't, and I know that the director doesn't.\" For all the talk about polygraphs,", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:020114johnoneillfbi911wtcsecurity.txt:18:146b7b1d88c4", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 6960, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "020114johnoneillfbi911wtcsecurity.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "020114johnoneillfbi911wtcsecurity", "chunk_index": 19, "text": "retired last November, told me.

I know I don't, and I know that Tom Pickard doesn't, and I know that the director doesn't.\" For all the talk about polygraphs, the bureau ruled out an investigation into the source of the leak, despite an official request by Barry Mawn, in New York. Meanwhile, intelligence had been streaming in concerning a likely Al Qaeda attack. \"It all came together in the third week in June,\" Clarke said. \"The C.I.A.'s view was that a major terrorist attack was coming in the next several weeks.\" On July 5th, Clarke summoned all the domestic security agencies-the Federal Aviation Administration, the Coast Guard, Customs, the Immigration and Naturalization Service, and the F.B.I.-and told them to increase their security in light of an impending attack. On August 19th, the Times ran an article about the briefcase incident and O'Neill's forthcoming retirement, which was to take place three days later. There was a little gathering for coffee as he packed up his office. **When O'Neill told ABC's Isham of his decision to work at the Trade Center, Isham had said jokingly, \"At least they're not going to bomb it again.\" O'Neill had replied, \"They'll probably try to finish the job.\"** On the day he started at the Trade Center-August 23rd-the C.I.A. sent a cable to the F.B.I. saying that two suspected Al Qaeda terrorists were already in the country. The bureau tried to track them down, but the addresses they had given when they entered the country proved to be false, and the men were never located. When he was growing up in Atlantic City, O'Neill was an altar boy at St. Nicholas of Tolentine Church. On September 28th, a week after his body was found in the rubble of the World Trade Center, a thousand mourners gathered at St. Nicholas to say farewell. Many of them were agents and policemen and members of foreign intelligence services who had followed O'Neill into the war against terrorism long before it became a rallying cry for the nation. The hierarchy of the F.B.I. attended, including the now retired director Louis Freeh. Richard Clarke, who says that he had not shed a tear since September 11th, suddenly broke down when the bagpipes played and the casket passed by. O'Neill's last weeks had been happy ones. The moment he left the F.B.I., his spirits had lifted. He talked about getting a new Mercedes to replace his old Buick. He told Anna that they could now afford to get married.

On the last Saturday night of his life, he attended a wedding with Valerie, and they danced nearly every number. He told a friend within Valerie's hearing, \"I'm gonna get her a ring.\" **On September 10th, O'Neill called Robert Tucker, a friend and security-company executive, and arranged to get together that evening to talk about security issues at the Trade Center. Tucker met O'Neill in the lobby of the north tower, and the two men rode the elevator up to O'Neill's new office, on the thirty-fourth floor. \"He was incredibly proud of what he was doing,\" Tucker told me. Then they went to a bar at the top of the tower for a drink. Afterward, they headed uptown to Elaine's, where they were joined by their friend Jerry Hauer. Around midnight, the three men dropped in on the China Club, a night spot in midtown. \"John made the statement that he thought something big was going to happen,\" Hauer recalled.** Valerie James waited up for O'Neill. He didn't come in until 2:30 A.M. \"The next morning, I was frosty,\" she recalled. \"He came into my bathroom and put his arms around me. He said, 'Please forgive me.' \" He offered to drive her to work, and dropped her off at eight-thirteen in the flower district, where she had an appointment, and headed to the Trade Center. At 8:46 A.M., when American Airlines Flight 11 crashed into the north tower, John P. O'Neill, Jr., was on a train to New York, to install some computer equipment and visit his father's new office. From the window of the train he saw smoke coming from the Trade Center. He called his father on his cell phone. \"He said he was O.K. He was on his way out to assess the damage,\" John, Jr., recalled. Valerie James was arranging flowers in her office when \"the phones started ringing off the hook.\" A second airliner had just hit the south tower. \"At nine-seventeen, John calls,\" James remembered. He said, \"Honey, I want you to know I'm O.K. My God, Val, it's terrible. There are body parts everywhere. Are you crying?\" he asked. She was. Then he said, \"Val, I think my employers are dead. I can't lose this job.\" \"They're going to need you more than ever,\" she told him. At nine-twenty-five, Anna DiBattista, who was driving to Philadelphia on business, received a call from O'Neill. \"The connection was good at the beginning,\" she recalled. \"He was", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:020114johnoneillfbi911wtcsecurity.txt:20:ee29d842d1e3", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 6962, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "020114johnoneillfbi911wtcsecurity.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "020114johnoneillfbi911wtcsecurity", "chunk_index": 21, "text": "He said, \"Honey, I want you to know I'm O.K.

He said he was O.K. I said, 'Are you sure you're out of the building?' He told me he loved me. I knew he was going to go back in.\" Wesley Wong, an F.B.I. agent who had known O'Neill for more than twenty years, raced over to the north tower to help set up a command center. \"John arrived on the scene,\" Wong recalled. \"He asked me if there was any information I could divulge. I knew he was now basically an outsider. One of the questions he asked was 'Is it true the Pentagon has been hit?' I said, 'Gee, John, I don't know. Let me try to find out.' At one point, he was on his cell phone and he was having trouble with the reception and started walking away. I said, 'I'll catch up with you later.' \" Wong last saw O'Neill walking toward the tunnel leading to the second tower.

The vice president rarely calls the Senate leader--a Democrat he dismisses as an \"obstructionist\"--so Tom Daschle knew the topic was important when he hurried into his Capitol office. What he heard was a plea, and a warning. The Senate will soon launch hearings on why we weren't prepared for, and warned about, September 11. The intelligence committee will study the matter, but mostly behind closed doors. Cheney was calling to pre-emptively protest public hearings by other committees. If the Democrats insisted, Bush administration officials might say they're too busy running the war on terrorism to show up. Press the issue, Cheney implied, and you risk being accused of interfering with the mission. Daschle was noncommittal and, after the call, unmoved. \"Intelligence is just a piece of it,\" he said. \"People need to know what happened.\" As the president rehearsed his laboriously crafted State of the Union address last week, this was the State of the Capital: on the verge of open hostilities. President George W. Bush's standing in the polls remained remarkably high, thanks to his handling of the war. The speech was designed to highlight his commander's role, and his costly (and probably popular) battle plans at home and abroad. But his Republican Party isn't as well liked as he is. War aside, Congress and the country remain sharply divided. At a time of recession, when government aid is back in fashion and \"free market\" answers look shaky in an Enron-ized world, Democrats are gathering the will to fight Bush on a host of domestic issues. That puts the focus squarely on Daschle, who controls--barely--the only part of the capital in Democratic hands. In an interview, he sketched his agenda. Seeking revisions in Bush's 10-year, $1.35 trillion tax", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:020204newsweek.txt:0:e2f96f471f42", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 6965, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "020204newsweek.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "020204newsweek", "chunk_index": 1, "text": "as he is. War aside, Congress and the country remain sharply divided. At a time of recession, when government aid is back in fashion and \"free market\" answers look shaky in an Enron-ized world, Democrats are gathering the will to fight Bush on a host of domestic issues. That puts the focus squarely on Daschle, who controls--barely--the only part of the capital in Democratic hands. In an interview, he sketched his agenda. Seeking revisions in Bush's 10-year, $1.35 trillion tax cut isn't part of it. Daschle was clobbered by some of his own colleagues for suggesting last month that the measure (which 12 of them voted for) was excessive. Now he makes it clear he won't attempt to change it this year. He was noncommittal on Bush's request for a $48 billion increase in defense spending. But Daschle's Democrats will fight for a universal, feder-al prescription-drug plan--not the narrower one Bush will propose. With John McCain, they will push the soft-money ban the White House loathes. They will press for more education spending than Bush wants, and refuse to accept further income-tax cuts--citing Alan Green-span's declaration that more \"stimulus\" isn't needed right now. Democrats won't insist that the government balance its books this year. But they'll cry havoc about the risk that ballooning deficits pose to Social Security and Medicare. \"How is the president going to pay for what he wants to do?\" Daschle asks. \"Who pays?\" It's a tough hand to play: decrying deficits is rarely a way to win elections. And the Bush White House isn't inclined to go easy on him. It and its allies are dropping daisy cutters--including ads in Daschle's home state of South Dakota--portraying him as a power-hungry Machiavelli of the Plains. GOP consultant Frank Luntz suggested in a memo that candidates attack \"Daschle Democrats.\" An ad by a conservative group compared him to Saddam Hussein. GOP Senate Leader Trent Lott, normally a collegial soul, accused him of wanting to \"Daschle-ize\" the budget with tax hikes. Campaigning in South Carolina for a Senate candidate last week, the soft-spoken Daschle hardly seemed demonic. A career politician and a master of inside maneuver--and, like Bush, a dedicated jogger--he has a history of winning narrow victories with doggedness and patience. He's also among, if not the most active of, the many Senate Democrats eying a presidential run, saying that he's keeping the door open \"just barely.\" In the meantime he oversees every detail of his party's drive to increase its 50-49-1 semi-majority. At a fund-raising dinner for Judge Alex Sanders at the zoological gardens in Columbia, he noted the torch-lit paths, which made the place look like the set of \"Survivor.\" \"I'm the last guy on the island,\" he said, and seemed happy at the thought.

The body of Ian Langford, 40, a senior Fellow at the University of East Anglia's Centre for Social and Economic Research on the Global Environment, was discovered on Monday night by police and ambulancemen. The body was naked from the waist down and partly wedged under a chair. It is understood that doors to the terraced house were locked. A post-mortem examination failed to establish how Dr Langford, who lived alone in the house in Norwich, died. Dr Langford began working at the university in 1993 after gaining his PhD in childhood leukaemia and infection following a first-class honours degree in environmental sciences. He worked most recently as a senior researcher assessing risk to the environment. Professor Kerry Turner, director of the centre, said: \"We are all very shocked by this appalling news. Ian was without doubt one of Europe's leading experts on environmental risk, specialising in links between human health and environmental risk. He was known for his work on the effects on health of bathing water and air pollution, for example. He was one of the most brilliant colleagues I have ever had.\" FAIR USE NOTICE: This site contains copyrighted material the use of which has not always been specifically authorized by the copyright owner.

Posted on Thu, Feb. 28, 2002 **Pizza delivery may have been ambush** SUSPECT LATER FOUND DEAD By Sean Webby and Lisa Krieger Mercury News Dr. Tanya Holzmayer, a pioneering scientist, was surprised Wednesday night to find a Domino's Pizza deliveryman at the front door of her Mountain View home. Moments later, a former colleague appeared out of the dark, shot her dead and ran off, police said. Guyang ``Matthew'' Huang called his wife in Foster City with the news: I just killed my ex-boss. Now I'm going to kill myself. Within an hour, a jogger found Huang's body off a path near the San Mateo Bridge. A cell phone was in Huang's pocket and a .380-caliber handgun lay near his hand. Investigators on Thursday were just beginning to put together the details of the deadly nexus between the two immigrant scientists. ``It looked like an ambush,'' said Mountain View Police spokesman Jim Bennett. ``He may have used the pizza to lure her out.'' A former colleague of both Holzmayer and Huang thinks he knows the motive: Holzmayer fired Huang from his job at PPD Discovery, a biotech company in Menlo Park, according to Dr. Igor B. Roninson. ``She told me she got orders from senior management to fire him,'' said Roninson, a genomic scientist with the University of Illinois-Chicago and a consultant for PPD. ``She had to fulfill those orders, but was very upset. She had no choice, no options. ``But this is a year later!'' A company spokeswoman said Huang left PPD in June, but she wouldn't confirm that he was fired. Neither Huang nor Holzmayer were still with the company. Holzmayer had quit in December to start her own biotech venture. Both Holzmayer, 46, and Huang, 38, were highly regarded in genetics. She was a Russian-born genomic scientist who had co-invented a tool that has helped find hundreds of molecular targets to combat cancer and HIV. He was a brilliant scholar -- scoring 11th out of 230,000 students on his college entrance exams in China -- and an activist who fought for reform in his homeland once he came to the United States to study in 1986. Outside of the company's Menlo Park office on Thursday, puffy-eyed employees gathered in small groups but shook their heads when approached by a reporter. On Wednesday, just past 8:30 p.m., the Domino's deliveryman had pulled up to Holzmayer's home on Windmill Park Lane. Holzmayer and her teenage son were inside when the", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:020228mercurynews.txt:0:419603464745", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 6970, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "020228mercurynews.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "020228mercurynews", "chunk_index": 1, "text": "his college entrance exams in China -- and an activist who fought for reform in his homeland once he came to the United States to study in 1986.

On Wednesday, just past 8:30 p.m., the Domino's deliveryman had pulled up to Holzmayer's home on Windmill Park Lane. Holzmayer and her teenage son were inside when the doorbell rang. She told the deliveryman that she hadn't ordered a pizza, according to Mountain View police. Huang appeared from behind the deliveryman. He shot Holzmayer several times at close range in the chest and head, police said. As Holzmayer fell in her doorway, Huang ran to a Ford Explorer and drove away. Police said the deliveryman witnessed the shooting but was not involved. A Domino's spokeswoman said the driver wasn't hurt, but would be offered counseling and time off. Just a few doors away, the Brogan family heard the shots, then the tires screeching, and saw the deliveryman running in a panic. After calling 911, Evan Brogan went with his mother, Micheline, a nurse, to their neighbors' home. Holzmayer was lying in her doorway with no pulse. ``We were just trying to help. But she was gone,'' Evan said. Less than an hour after the shooting, Huang called his wife, according to Foster City Police Capt. Craig Courtin. He told her about the shooting and that he was going to kill himself, police said. He told her he was near their home by the bay. Then he hung up. Huang's wife called 911, and Foster City police used search dogs to comb the area. They ran into a jogger who had seen Huang's body lying off the walkway that locals call ``The Levee.'' He had fired a single bullet into his head, according to Robert Foucrault, San Mateo County's acting coroner. Soon afterward, police interviewed Huang's wife, whom they wouldn't identify. She said she believed that her husband had killed Holzmayer and told them where they both had worked. People who answered the door Thursday at Huang's apartment declined any comment. Holzmayer and her family came to the United States in 1989, according to Roninson, a classmate of hers at Moscow State University in Russia. She was an intellectual, he said, torn between becoming a classical pianist or a scientist. She chose genomics over her beloved Chopin, focusing on helping create new drugs that interfere with replication of the virus that causes AIDS. Until December, Holzmayer had served a four-year tenure as senior vice president of genomics for PPD Discovery, a division of PPD Inc. of Wilmington, N.C. It was at PPD Discovery that Holzmayer met Huang, who began working as the firm's director of molecular biology and bioinformatics in early 2000.

Roninson said Huang ``gave a perfectly normal, charismatic impression.'' Holzmayer told Roninson two weeks ago that she had just received funding for her new start-up venture to use modern methodologies to develop new drugs. ``She said she had never felt so happy in her life.''

The tower was set on fire by debris from the twin towers and burned for about seven hours before collapsing in the late afternoon under previously unexplained circumstances. The analysis of its collapse is one of the first detailed findings by a team of engineers organized by the Federal Emergency Management Agency and the American Society of Civil Engineers to understand the fate of all the buildings around the site. As much as 42,000 gallons of diesel fuel was stored near ground level in the tower and ran in pipes up to smaller tanks and emergency generators for Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani's command center, the Secret Service's office and other tenants. Investigators have determined that the burning fuel apparently undermined what is known as a transfer truss. The trusses, a series of steel beams that allowed the skyscraper to be built atop multistory electricity transformers, were critical to the structural integrity of the building and ran near the smaller diesel tanks. A failure of the same type of structural bridge contributed to the collapse of the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City when it was bombed in 1995. Federal guidelines for public buildings, created in 1996, warned of the dangers of such trusses in terrorist attacks.

A failure of the same type of structural bridge contributed to the collapse of the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City when it was bombed in 1995. Federal guidelines for public buildings, created in 1996, warned of the dangers of such trusses in terrorist attacks. ''It's certainly right in the vicinity where the columns go into this transfer system,'' said a person knowledgeable about the investigators' draft report on the World Trade Center. ''The rest of the building is built on top of the bridge.'' While 7 World Trade Center, which stood across Vesey Street just to the north of the twin towers, was not formally a federal building, it did house crucial government offices that included the city's nerve center for emergency response. The investigators said that their conclusions, combined with other findings about the failure and collapse of 5 World Trade Center, could prompt serious changes in the codes used in building construction. The findings are in a draft report that has already been circulated among government agencies, and are based on videos made on Sept. 11, witnesses' reports, interviews with firefighters, evidence from the debris pile and structural analysis. Team members, who described many of the findings, cautioned that the conclusions on the collapse of 7 World Trade Center could still be modified as reviews proceed. But Irwin Cantor, one of the building's original structural engineers, who is now a consulting engineer and member of the City Planning Commission, said the diesel-related failure of transfer trusses was a reasonable explanation for the collapse. He said he believed that diesel tanks were not envisioned in the original design of the building. ''It ended up with tenants who had diesels,'' Mr. Cantor said. ''I know none of that was planned at the beginning.'' According to floor plans submitted to the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which owns the land on which 7 World Trade sat, the building complied with city fire codes, said Frank Lombardi, the authority's chief engineer. Those codes permit no more than one fuel tank with a capacity of 275 gallons or less on above-ground floors, he said. Jerome M. Hauer, who was the director of Mayor Giuliani's Office of Emergency Management at the time the command center was opened at 7 World Trade, said several teams of engineers reviewed plans to open the office there. But no one ever mentioned any hazard associated with placing fuel tanks above ground, near a transfer truss, he said. ''There were a host of people who looked at this,'' said Mr. Hauer, who is now a managing director of the crisis and consequence group at Kroll Worldwide, a security consulting company based in New York. ''We relied on their", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:020302nytimes.txt:1:7678a1e5f1ce", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 6974, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "020302nytimes.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "020302nytimes", "chunk_index": 2, "text": "command center was opened at 7 World Trade, said several teams of engineers reviewed plans to open the office there.

''There were a host of people who looked at this,'' said Mr. Hauer, who is now a managing director of the crisis and consequence group at Kroll Worldwide, a security consulting company based in New York. ''We relied on their judgment.'' Fire officials did at one point question the storage of large amounts of fuel well above the ground level, saying that one large tank for the mayor's command center, if ever compromised, might fuel a fire that would threaten the building. The Sept. 11 draft report also has photographs and a description of debris collected from a previously undisclosed, multistory collapse within 5 World Trade Center, a nine-story office building that also burned on Sept. 11 but largely remained standing. The team has found that one specific type of bolted connection, called a column tree connection, that joined floor-support beams, failed in the heat of the fires, causing the four-story collapse in the part of 5 World Trade at the corner of Vesey and Church Streets. Although no one died as a result of the collapses in 5 and 7 World Trade Centers, since both stood long enough to be evacuated, the team's findings are likely to lead to recommended changes in the way public and government buildings are constructed, much the way similar studies did after the Northridge earthquake near Los Angeles in 1994 and the Oklahoma City bombing. The team is still deliberating on how tightly it can pin down the precise train of events that led to the collapse of the twin towers themselves. **But until now, the collapse of 7 World Trade has stood as one of the outstanding mysteries of the Sept. 11 attack, since before then, no modern, steel-reinforced high-rise in the United States had ever collapsed in a fire. ** High-rise buildings are designed to be able to survive a fire, even if the fire has to burn itself out. The strategy is to ensure that the steel support structures are strong enough or protected well enough from fire that they do not give way in the time it takes for everything inside an office building, like furniture, to burn. In major high-rise fires elsewhere in the country, such as the 1 Meridian Plaza fire in Philadelphia in 1991 and the First Interstate Bank fire in Los Angeles in 1988, this approach has worked. The 1 Meridian fire burned for 19 hours, leaping from floor to floor and burning out as combustible materials were used up. But the fires at 7 World Trade Center raged mainly on lower floors and never burned out, and in the chaos of Sept. 11, the Fire", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:020302nytimes.txt:2:05766ebd0521", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 6975, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "020302nytimes.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "020302nytimes", "chunk_index": 3, "text": "high-rise fires elsewhere in the country, such as the 1 Meridian Plaza fire in Philadelphia in 1991 and the First Interstate Bank fire in Los Angeles in 1988, this approach has worked. The 1 Meridian fire burned for 19 hours, leaping from floor to floor and burning out as combustible materials were used up. But the fires at 7 World Trade Center raged mainly on lower floors and never burned out, and in the chaos of Sept. 11, the Fire Department eventually decided to stop fighting the blazes. ''What the hell would burn so fiercely for seven hours that the Fire Department would be afraid to fight it?'' said one member of the investigating team. According to the Port Authority floor plans, 275-gallon diesel tanks sat on the fifth, seventh and eighth floors and were fed through pipes from the larger tanks near ground level. The team member said that while the diesel fuel remains the most likely candidate for feeding the fires, it was still unknown whether there could have been other sources of fuel in the building, kept there by tenants like the Secret Service that have disclosed little of what their spaces contained. The huge steel transfer trusses ran mostly through the fifth, sixth and seventh floors where the fires burned. The purpose of the trusses, which included zigzagging and horizontal members and were concentrated around the building's core, was to allow 7 World Trade to be built over two Consolidated Edison substations that already existed on that spot when the building went up in the late 1980's. Together the stations held 10 transformers, each about 35 feet high and 40 feet wide. Using the trusses to avoid having vertical structural columns pierce the transformers, the building was constructed around them like a hen sitting on a giant egg. ''We had to do design tricks to accommodate the existing Con Ed facility,'' said Mr. Cantor, the structural engineer. ''This building had an awful lot of transfers.'' Transfer trusses are a well-tested technique and are used in countless high-rise buildings, as well as in bridges around the world. Engineers say that transfer trusses, for most buildings, present no extraordinary hazard. But if there is an explosion, earthquake or long-burning fire, they can present a problem. In Oklahoma City, during the 1995 bombing of the Federal Building, a large transfer girder on the building's third floor gave way, helping to precipitate a progressive collapse that later analysis showed was responsible for most of the 168 deaths.

Roughly 30 seconds before the building goes down, a rooftop mechanical room starts to disappear, falling into the building's core. Then a second larger rooftop room sinks. The building then quickly collapses. Both rooms were above sections of the building held up by the trusses. Other video evidence shows fire concentrated in the floors containing the trusses and the fuel tanks. Dr. John D. Osteraas, director of civil engineering practice, Exponent Failure Analysis Associates, in Menlo Park, Calif., reviewed videos of the collapse, discussed it with other engineers and came to a similar conclusion; the fuel, the trusses and the fire brought 7 World Trade down. ''The pieces have come together,'' he said. ''Without the fuel, I think the building would have done fine.''

Senate Majority Leader Thomas A. Daschle (D-S.D.) said he had not been informed about the role, location or even the existence of the shadow government that the administration began to deploy the morning of the Sept. 11 hijackings. An aide to House Minority Leader Richard A. Gephardt (D-Mo.) said he similarly was unaware of the administration's move. Among Congress's GOP leadership, aides to House Speaker J. Dennis Hastert (Ill.), second in line to succeed the president if he became incapacitated, and to Senate Minority Leader Trent Lott (Miss.) said they were not sure whether they knew. Aides to Sen. Robert C. Byrd (D-W. Va.) said he had not been told. As Senate president pro tempore, he is in line to become president after the House speaker. Bush acknowledged yesterday that the administration had taken extensive measures to guarantee \"the continuity of government,\" after it was revealed that about 100 top officials, spanning every executive branch department, have been sent to live and work in two fortified locations on the East Coast. This system, in which high-ranking administrators are rotating in and out of the two sites, represents the first time a president has activated the contingency plan, which was devised during the Cold War of the 1950s so that federal rule could continue if Washington were struck by a catastrophic attack. It was unclear yesterday whether any federal documents -- prepared either by the current White House or by Bush's predecessors dating to Dwight D. Eisenhower -- specify whether congressional leaders should be told if the plan is put into effect. At least one relatively general document, a 1988 executive order entitled \"Assignment of Emergency Preparedness Responsibilities,\" said the White House's National Security Council \"shall arrange for Executive branch liaison", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:020302post.txt:0:134746b97342", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 6979, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "020302post.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "020302post", "chunk_index": 1, "text": "rule could continue if Washington were struck by a catastrophic attack.

At least one relatively general document, a 1988 executive order entitled \"Assignment of Emergency Preparedness Responsibilities,\" said the White House's National Security Council \"shall arrange for Executive branch liaison with, and assistance to, the Congress and the federal judiciary on national security-emergency preparedness matters.\" The executive order, signed by President Ronald Reagan, is a precursor to documents outlining the contingency plans in greater detail, which have not been made public. Regardless of whether Bush had an obligation to notify legislative leaders, the congressional leaders' ignorance of the plan he set in motion could raise the question of how this shadow administration would establish its legitimacy with Congress in the event it needed to step in for a crippled White House. At least some members of Congress suggested yesterday that the administration should have conferred about its plans, which were first reported in The Washington Post yesterday. \"There are two other branches of government that are central to the functioning of our democracy,\" said Rep. William Delahunt (D-Mass.), a member of the House Judiciary Committee. \"I would hope the speaker and the minority leader would at least pose the question, 'What about us?' \" Other lawmakers said they believe the federal government lacks adequate plans to be certain that all three of its branches could function if terrorists disabled Washington. White House officials did not elaborate on why the president did not consult with congressional leaders. \"The president addressed this earlier today, and I will have to refer you to his comments,\" spokesman Taylor Gross said. Speaking yesterday on a trip to Des Moines, Bush did not describe the deployment in detail. He said he had \"an obligation as the president [to] put measures in place that, should somebody be successful in attacking Washington, D.C., [would guarantee] there's an ongoing government.\" \"This is serious business,\" the president said. \"I still take the threats that we receive from al Qaeda killers and terrorists very seriously.\" He made clear the extent to which he believes that terrorism poses a lingering threat to the U.S. government. \"That's one reason why the vice president was going to undisclosed locations,\" Bush told reporters. \"And I will tell you, there are people still in this world who want to harm America,\" the president said, vowing that \"we're doing everything in our power to protect the American people.\" At the Pentagon, which routinely rotates top military officials to secure locations, spokeswoman Victoria Clarke said: \"It is absolute common sense, absolutely appropriate that the government should have all the parts and all the pieces in place so in", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:020302post.txt:1:3e7f1d35dd29", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 6980, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "020302post.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "020302post", "chunk_index": 2, "text": "was going to undisclosed locations,\" Bush told reporters. \"And I will tell you, there are people still in this world who want to harm America,\" the president said, vowing that \"we're doing everything in our power to protect the American people.\" At the Pentagon, which routinely rotates top military officials to secure locations, spokeswoman Victoria Clarke said: \"It is absolute common sense, absolutely appropriate that the government should have all the parts and all the pieces in place so in case of a crisis, in case of an emergency, the government can and will continue to function.\" The House and Senate each has a contingency plan. \"Precautions have been taken and arrangements have been made to move the work of Congress to another location,\" Daschle said. Bush made his remarks at the Printer Inc., a relatively small Des Moines business that the White House chose as a backdrop to tout changes the administration favors to the nation's pension laws. The printing plant assists workers with 401(k) plans and encourages them to take an active role in saving money for retirement. For the second day in a row, Bush sought to draw attention to his plans for what he has begun to call \"retirement security,\" a combination of pension changes and redesign of Social Security. \"You see, we're going to have to encourage more savings in America, because people are going to live longer lives,\" Bush said. Alluding to his more controversial view that workers should be allow to invest some of their Social Security taxes in the stock market, Bush said: \"We ought to do everything we can in Washington, D.C., to encourage people to own a piece of the future.\" His visit to Iowa of slightly more than three hours followed a formula the White House has used since New Year's, as the president has begun to travel to states in which GOP candidates face tight races in the fall elections. These visits combine a forum to promote one of the administration's legislative priorities with a political fundraiser. Bush attended a luncheon on behalf of Rep. Tom Latham (R-Iowa), a quiet conservative first elected in the \"Republican Revolution\" of 1994. He has easily won reelection since then, but his prospects are far less certain this year because his district -- until now heavily Republican -- has been redrawn to include more Democratic voters. The luncheon raised $275,000 for Latham and $200,000 for the Iowa Republican Party. This was Bush's fourth trip to Iowa since becoming president. The state is significant to the GOP's struggle to retain its majority in the House and to win back control of the Senate this fall -- and to Bush's reelection aspirations in two years. Bush narrowly lost the state to Vice President Al Gore in 2000. Goldstein reported from Des Moines.

Pilot Dr. Steven Mostow also died. Kent Rickenbaugh, 64, owned two car dealerships in the Denver area. Caroline Rickenbaugh, 62, was known for her involvement in the community. Bart Rickenbaugh, 35, lived in Bozeman, Mont. Mostow, 63, was one of the country's leading infectious disease experts and was associate dean at the University of Colorado Health Sciences Center. Mostow was a crusader for better health, an early advocate for widespread flu vaccinations and more recently an expert on the threat of bioterrorism. He was a champion for rural health care and childhood immunizations. For the past three years, he had been helping to expand the 9Health Fair, a program that benefits thousands of people in Colorado. Investigators returned to the scene of the plane crash Monday to try to figure out why the twin-engine Cessna 340 went down. The plane was headed to Centennial from Gunnison when Mostow reported engine trouble around 4:30 p.m., Federal Aviation Administration spokesman Jerry Snyder said. The plane crashed near mile marker 190 in unincorporated Douglas County. Witnesses say they saw the plane go down. \"As we came over the hill we saw the plane coming fairly straight toward the highway actually, and swerving from side to side, losing altitude fast,\" Willen Guyer said. \"I think the guy saw the highway and turned away from it and when he turned left he just went nose down into the ground.\" The weather was cloudy with snow flurries; however, National Transportation Safety Board investigators said weather did not appear to be a factor in the crash, Douglas County Sheriff's Office spokesman Bernie Harris said.

A microbiologist who had for 25 years studied the survival of primitive organisms in the Antarctic environment and the implications for the wider universe, David Wynn-Williams, had been using his findings to assess the likelihood of the existence of some form of life on Mars. These studies, which had led to an exchange of ideas with Nasa in the US, explored the behaviour of life forms on the frontiers of existence. In the course of a series of ten visits to Antarctica from the mid-1970s onwards, Wynn-Williams had assessed the capability of microbes to adapt to environmental extremes, including the bombardment of ultraviolet rays and global warming conditions which might parallel those of the early Primary Era of Earth s existence, or of present day Mars. Besides his links with Nasa, he had also collaborated with the Italian Antarctic programme at Terra Nova Bay, with the New Zealand programme at Scott Base and with American research programmes in the Antarctic at McMurdo. A man of boundless physical as well as intellectual energy, Wynn-Williams generated a constant flow of ideas, which entranced both his contemporaries and the young. He was killed in a road accident while out jogging near his Cambridge home. David Wynn-Williams was born in Cheshire in 1946 and educated at Calday Grange Grammar School and Birkenhead Technical College. From the latter he went, in 1965, to the University College of Wales, Aberystwyth, where he read botany and microbiology, graduating BSc in 1968. He stayed at Aberystwyth for a further three years, being awarded his PhD for a thesis on environmental biology in 1971. Wynn-Williams was a talented science teacher who loved imparting ideas to the young. For the next two years he taught school biology, first in South London and then at the Judd School, Tonbridge. When he subsequently moved to Cambridge and into higher research and farflung fieldwork, he nevertheless continued to revel in talking directly to classroom students about the excitement of developing scientific ideas.

Wynn-Williams was a talented science teacher who loved imparting ideas to the young. For the next two years he taught school biology, first in South London and then at the Judd School, Tonbridge. When he subsequently moved to Cambridge and into higher research and farflung fieldwork, he nevertheless continued to revel in talking directly to classroom students about the excitement of developing scientific ideas. He had first become interested in the polar regions after leading the University College of Wales expedition to Iceland in 1970. In 1974 he was invited to join the British Antarctic Survey in Cambridge and spent the next two winters and three summers at Signy Island in the South Orkneys, studying terrestrial microbiology. This became the central study of his life and he was to return on four separate occasions: 1980-81, 1984-85, 1987-88 and 1990-91, to continue research at Antarctic lithosol sites those whose soil is composed of wholly or partly weathered rock fragments. In the meantime he was, in 1982-83, guest scientist with the New Zealand Antarctic Research Programme. Ten years later, he was appointed leader of the British Antarctic Survey Expedition to the Mars Glacier lithosol sites, on Alexander Island in West Antarctica. After a year, 1993, as section head of terrestrial biology in BAS s Terrestrial and Freshwater Life Sciences Division, Wynn-Williams went in 1995 as co-leader of an international expedition which worked in the McMurdo Dry Valleys and Terra Nova Bay. He was later involved in two separate expeditions to oversee the development of an Antarctic desert research site at Mars Oasis. In 2000 he was appointed leader of the Antarctic Astrobiology Project, which explores the effects of environmental stress at the limits of life on Earth analogous to conditions which might subsist on Mars. This drew Wynn-Williams into collaboration with the Nasa Ames Research Centre, the Johnson Space Centre and Lunar & Planetary Institute, Houston, and Montana State University, to develop and evaluate a miniature confocal microscope and Raman spectrometer (CMaRS) for use on a Mars landing vehicle. CMaRS has been adopted as the prime instrument for the proposed UK-led Vanguard Mars lander-rover mission, to be submitted to the European Space Agency. Wynn-Williams had also worked with the German Aerospace Institute at Cologne, on the UVC (short-wave ultra-violet radiation in the 200-280 nanometre waveband) atmosphere of early Earth and Mars. Last year he returned to the Taylor Valley long-term ecological research site in the McMurdo Dry Valleys, where he worked with colleagues on the American Antarctic programme.

Richard Myers, chairman, Joint Chiefs of Staff Saturday, April 6, 2002, 5:30 p.m. Gen. Myers Interview With CNN TV (Interview with CNN TV, Evans & Novak) Hunt: I'm Al Hunt. Robert Novak and I will question the chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff. Novak: He is Air Force General Richard Myers. While sending Secretary of State Colin Powell to the Middle East, President Bush urged Israel to halt its military operations against Palestinians and called on Arab states to restrain Palestinian terrorists. Earlier in the week, the Pentagon linked Iraq's Saddam Hussein to terrorism against Israel. Rumsfeld: I am simply trying to let the people of Iraq understand what their leadership is doing, to let the people of the Middle East and the rest of the world, people in Europe, know what is in fact being done to arm young people and send them out to blow up restaurants and shopping malls and pizza parlors. Novak: Secretary Rumsfeld also brought Iran into the U.S. war against terrorism. Rumsfeld: There is no question but that al Qaeda have moved in and found sanctuary in Iran, and there is no question but that al Qaeda have moved into Iran and out of Iran, to the south and dispersed to some other countries. Novak: Richard Myers joined the Air Force in 1965 as a second lieutenant through the ROTC program at Kansas State University. His experience as a command pilot included 600 combat hours in the F-4. He was commander-in-chief of the North American Aerospace Defense Command before coming to Washington as vice chairman of the joint chiefs in March 2000. President Bush made him the 15th JCS chairman last October, the first Air Force officer so named since 1982. We are interviewing General Myers at the Pentagon. General Myers, in view of the comments by Defense Secretary Rumsfeld this past week about the support for the suicide bombers in Israel by other Arab states, can we say now that the terrorism in Israel is part of the entire global campaign by terrorists? Myers: What we've said from", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:020406dodcnn.txt:0:93159320d30a", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 6989, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "020406dodcnn.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "020406dodcnn", "chunk_index": 1, "text": "in March 2000.

General Myers, in view of the comments by Defense Secretary Rumsfeld this past week about the support for the suicide bombers in Israel by other Arab states, can we say now that the terrorism in Israel is part of the entire global campaign by terrorists? Myers: What we've said from the very start is that the goals on our global war on terrorism are against international terrorist organizations, those nation-states or others that support them, and against those who have weapons of mass destruction that could fall into terrorist hands. So those are the goals that have guided us from September 11 forward. Novak: And would you say then that the Palestinian suicide bombers fall into that category? Myers: I think what the secretary was saying is that that beautiful young lady that was the suicide bomber in Israel just recently didn't just wake up that morning and decide to go put on a bomb costume, that there had to be people supplying the finances to provide the explosives, to provide the device, the detonating device, and so forth. And that it was not just -- these aren't just things that people do capriciously, that there's probably a system of support there. I think that's what he was trying to say. Novak: He also, Secretary Rumsfeld also indicated that the elements of the Al Qaeda have infiltrated into Iran, perhaps with the help of the government there, infiltrated out. Is the view here at the Pentagon that Al Qaeda is still a viable military force that could give us trouble elsewhere in the world? Myers: Let me just rephrase that a little bit. I think it's fair to say that Al Qaeda is still a viable force. We know that are a very decentralized organization, very compartmented, no one person generally knows everything about every operation, very few key nodes, many nodes of operation. So they're certainly still a viable force. We think inside Afghanistan that there are both pockets of Taliban and Al Qaeda that are a viable military force to be reckoned with. Hunt: General, talking about Afghanistan, the U.S. hopes to train and build an Afghan national army, but most experts say that's going to take about five years before it's really successful. In the interim, who is going to provide the security, and how will we guarantee there won't be other terrorist groups in that country? Myers: It's a very important point, and I think the first thing we need to say, as a follow-on to the other question, is that there are these pockets of Taliban and Al Qaeda that would love to create instability inside Afghanistan. They would do that by taking on any", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:020406dodcnn.txt:1:2a36de82ee33", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 6990, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "020406dodcnn.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "020406dodcnn", "chunk_index": 2, "text": "five years before it's really successful.

Myers: It's a very important point, and I think the first thing we need to say, as a follow-on to the other question, is that there are these pockets of Taliban and Al Qaeda that would love to create instability inside Afghanistan. They would do that by taking on any of the security forces that are in there right now, whether U.S. or coalition, and they would also go against the Afghan interim administration, trying to disrupt it, because they see that in their best interest. And that's why we'll continue our coalition efforts on the war on terrorism against Al Qaeda and Taliban. In addition, as you know, there's a U.K.-led interim security assistance force in the Kabul area that provides security for the capital and for the interim administration right now. When Chairman Karzai of the Afghan interim administration came to Washington, and when I visited him later in Afghanistan, his number- one priority was to create an Afghan national army, because he realizes that, in the end, ultimately the Afghan people are going to have to provide for their own security. Hunt: Well, yes, but again I want to get to the question of the interim. Former U.N. Ambassador Richard Holbrooke says we only have 10 percent of the peacekeeping force in Afghanistan that we had in Bosnia and that we're in danger, he says, of repeating 1989, of winning the war and losing the peace, if we don't increase that peacekeeping force. Can you go along with a larger peacekeeping force? Myers: Well, I think the issues that we're working, we have -- again, I'll go back. We have our coalition forces in there that are working the remnants of Taliban and Al Qaeda. We have the issue of ensuring that the warlords cooperate through this period as well. We have the interim security assistance force. And then we have this army. And I don't think I would agree that it's going to take us five years to train an Afghan national army -- which includes, by the way, the border patrol as well. Hunt: General, let me tell you how it looks from far away. It looks like the Iranians are controlling much of western Afghanistan, there are some of the different elements of Islamic radicals controlling eastern Afghanistan, heroin and opium production is on the rise, and Chairman Karzai's control is limited to Kabul and the environs. You just got back from Afghanistan. How would you disagree with that picture? Myers: I would just characterize it slightly different. Nobody says this is going to be an easy environment or this is going to be an easy path to peace and prosperity in Afghanistan. But", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:020406dodcnn.txt:2:f9a8cc7a34a6", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 6991, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "020406dodcnn.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "020406dodcnn", "chunk_index": 3, "text": "Afghanistan, there are some of the different elements of Islamic radicals controlling eastern Afghanistan, heroin and opium production is on the rise, and Chairman Karzai's control is limited to Kabul and the environs. You just got back from Afghanistan. How would you disagree with that picture? Myers: I would just characterize it slightly different. Nobody says this is going to be an easy environment or this is going to be an easy path to peace and prosperity in Afghanistan. But I would say, due to our actions that started in October, that this is the best hope the Afghan people have for a more normal, a more prosperous life. An Afghan interim administration has been stood up because we provided the environment for which it could hopefully flourish. We have international attention on that. There are people that are dealing with the drug problem, the opium production. We know that's a serious problem. So this an issue for the international community. I think it's being addressed appropriately across a wide range of fronts, to include nongovernmental organizations who are in there trying to provide services. They will probably either medical or schooling or whatever or relief aid. And nobody says it's going to be an easy problem. Novak: General Myers, Kenneth Adelman, who held some very important national security posts in the government in the past, close friend of Secretary Rumsfeld and of Vice President Cheney, has written that if the United States were to go into Iraq to remove Saddam Hussein, militarily it would be a cakewalk. And I asked Mr. Adelman about that a bit more recently, and he confirmed that's what he meant, a cakewalk. Is that the view here at the Pentagon, that it would be a cakewalk? Myers: Well, first, let's establish right up front that nobody has said that that's going to be a military mission, nobody has said we're going to do it, and certainly there's been no time frame set up for that. As a military person, I think we'd have to look at that very, very carefully. When we put our young sons and daughters of this country in harm's way, I don't think you can every call that a cakewalk. And we've seen how tough it's been in Afghanistan. Tragically, we've lost some lives. And that was a country that did not have an organized military, per se. The situation is, you just can't overlay Afghanistan, that template, onto Iraq. And I would never refer to it as a cakewalk. Novak: I understand, of course, that there has been no decision made on an operation against Iraq. But the other side of the coin, General Scowcroft, former national security adviser, says it would take 200,000 U.S. troops. Can you give us any idea, which is closer to reality, that we could need 200,000 troops there? Myers: Well, what we know", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:020406dodcnn.txt:3:664c7188444b", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 6992, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "020406dodcnn.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "020406dodcnn", "chunk_index": 4, "text": "is, you just can't overlay Afghanistan, that template, onto Iraq.

Can you give us any idea, which is closer to reality, that we could need 200,000 troops there? Myers: Well, what we know is that the situation since Desert Storm and today has changed dramatically, both for U.S. and coalition forces and for Iraqi forces. The Iraqi armed forces are about 40 percent, in terms of numbers, of what it was in the Gulf War. And likewise, our forces, we have more precision weapons and so forth. For instance, we use 10 percent precision weapons in the Gulf War. We used slightly over 60 percent in Afghanistan. Our capabilities have grown; Iraqi capabilities have diminished over the same period of time. Sanctions being part of the reason, some of the reason their capabilities have waned. Hunt: General, one big success we had this week is that U.S.-led security forces went into Pakistan and captured one of the top Al Qaeda operatives, Zubaydah. Will there be other U.S. missions in Pakistan to go after and capture Al Qaeda and Taliban who are hiding out there? Myers: Let me recharacterize that. I think the mission was Pakistani-led with U.S. assistance, several agencies and some Intel agencies. Hunt: \"The New York Times\" says that U.S. forces were essential, is that not right? Myers: Well, I think everything we've done with Pakistan has been in a partnership. And I can't characterize it that way. It was not a military... (Crosstalk) Hunt: Do you expect to see other such partnerships like that in Pakistan going after Al Qaeda and Taliban? Myers: Absolutely, and not just in Pakistan. As we've stated many time, that this war needs to be fought with all instruments of national power, not just the military. And that was a perfect example of where civil agencies made a very big find in Zubaydah. So sometimes it'll be military acts that will be very visible, sometimes it will be other agencies that will -- and not just in Pakistan, but around the world. That's the kind of cooperation we're going to need. Novak: General, we're going to take a short break now. But when we come back, we will ask General Myers about current U.S. military capability. Novak: General Richard Myers, there has been testimony by generals and admirals before Congress that the U.S. forces, after the campaign in Afghanistan, are tired, overextended, depleted. Do you think the U.S. forces have to take an extended rest period before being ready for a next phase of the war against terrorism if it's on a military basis?

Do you think the U.S. forces have to take an extended rest period before being ready for a next phase of the war against terrorism if it's on a military basis? Myers: First, let me talk about the statements that have appeared in some of the publications. I think, in several cases, they were just a little bit out of context and probably overplayed the issue of exhausted and tired and depleted, because I don't think any of our commanders think our forces are exhausted or depleted or tired. The thing we have to realize, this is going to be a very long war, this war on terrorism. We are in maybe the first chapter of a many-chapter book. We do need to work our rhythm and our pacing to make sure that we have the forces needed to do whatever the president calls upon us to do. But I can assure you and I can ensure the American public that we are as ready today as we were before September 11, and we'll be that way for the foreseeable future as far as I can tell. Novak: Well, sir let me put it on a geographical basis. If continuing the mop-up operation in Afghanistan, if there was another Arab country we were in, could we do all that at the same time as perhaps dealing with the crisis in North Korea? Could we conduct a three-front war? Myers: My belief is we could. That's well within our capabilities. If you look back at the defense strategy that was outlined in the Quadrennial Defense Review that came out last year, that was the strategy and those were the force sizing constructs that were used. And we have analyzed some of that to see how we can fulfill that strategy, and we're confident we can fulfill it. Hunt: General, you and Secretary Rumsfeld in recent days have spoken frequently about the increasingly bad behavior of Iraq and of Iran. You were asked a question about North Korea the other day and you said basically not much has changed there. And I guess my question is why is North Korea in the axis of evil? Was it affirmative action to say, you know, here's one non- Muslim country we're going to throw in? Myers: I don't think that had anything to do with it. I think the reason that we worry about North Korea is, first of all, that they have developed missile technology. They have a thoroughly robust missile inventory, and they're willing to proliferate that to other states that perhaps wouldn't use", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:020406dodcnn.txt:5:00d59115b8a1", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 6994, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "020406dodcnn.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "020406dodcnn", "chunk_index": 6, "text": "question is why is North Korea in the axis of evil?

I think the reason that we worry about North Korea is, first of all, that they have developed missile technology. They have a thoroughly robust missile inventory, and they're willing to proliferate that to other states that perhaps wouldn't use this hardware responsibly. We also know that they're involved in weapons of mass destruction. So I think it's those two things that lead us to believe it's a country that we have to be concerned with. Hunt: Well, you know, South Koreans had resumed talks with them on their weapons plans, and the North Koreans have said that they're willing to resume talks with the U.S. now. Former president Bill Clinton said that it would be a big mistake not to resume talks with the North Koreans. From a military point of view, as the top military office in the United States, could you go along with resuming talks to North Koreans right now? Myers: Well, I'd have to see if there's any quid pro quo here that's being requested. But clearly, the way to resolve the problem on the Korean peninsula is through diplomacy. And if talks can lead to that, and confidence building measures and so forth, then I think that's in everybody's best interest. The last thing we want to do is have a new Korean War on the peninsula. Novak: General, it's been widely reported that we, the United States, has a lot of the available hardware into Afghanistan and the very special operation there. Is the need to replace those weapons; is that a real problem for the United States at this point? Myers: It's not a problem, but it is a priority. And in both our -- the year '02 supplemental that's in front of the Congress right now, in the fiscal year '03 budget that's in front of the Congress, both of them have substantial resources to ensure our inventories are adequate. And so we're dealing with that. Novak: So it's not a problem? You don't consider that a big problem? Myers: I do not consider it a problem. Novak: OK. The president, President Bush during his campaign for president, many times stated that the U.S. military was hollowed out under the Clinton administration. In the less than eight months between the time that the president took office and the terrorist attacks of September 11, had it been rebuilt sufficiently so that we had these successes, or perhaps was not in as bad of shape as was indicated during the campaign? Myers: Well, I think you saw in the '03 budget that went in front of the Congress, there was a nearly $50", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:020406dodcnn.txt:6:72766d6796e3", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 6995, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "020406dodcnn.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "020406dodcnn", "chunk_index": 7, "text": "that the U.S. military was hollowed out under the Clinton administration.

Myers: Well, I think you saw in the '03 budget that went in front of the Congress, there was a nearly $50 billion increase in the Defense Department's budget. Myers: And what it funded was some health care that had been authorized by our Congress but hadn't been funded yet, pay raises and a lot of the readiness accounts, where we needed to get out of this pathology, as we called it, poised reliant on the supplemental appropriation to make up for readiness accounts, deficits in the fiscal budget that we would submit in February. So we did all that, and there were some accounts that needed to be plussed up. And we still have some issues with modernization. We've got tactical aircraft that are aging. We've got tanks that are aging. And so, you know, I think that a lot of that has been worked in the fiscal year '03 budget. But our readiness and we've always stated that our readiness for first-to-fight units has always been very, very high, and that's been true for many years now. Hunt: General, going back to Middle East, given the incredible animosity between Arafat and Sharon, a number of experts think that if the Tenet plan were to be adopted and if there were to be a cease- fire, it only could be guaranteed with the presence of U.S. military forces in the West Bank. Would you go along with that, if necessary? Myers: It's a little bit more complex problem, I think, than just putting forces on the ground. We'd have to first of all, there's not been any requests that I know of or any proposal on the table that we've evaluated. So I can't give you a very good answer for that specifically. But one of the things you have to consider when you talk about either peacekeeping or peacemaking is what will the mission be? Is it going to be a peacekeeping mission? Is it going to be a peacemaking mission? What are the rules of engagement you abide by? What are the command and control arrangements? What do both parties expect out of this? Duration? Lots of questions that we haven't even started to discuss. So I think it's probably premature to say whether or not it'd be a good idea or not. It just hasn't come up as an idea yet. Hunt: General, we're going to take another quick break now. And when we come back, we'll have the Big Question for General Myers.

It just hasn't come up as an idea yet. Hunt: General, we're going to take another quick break now. And when we come back, we'll have the Big Question for General Myers. Hunt: The Big Question for General Myers: One embarrassment for the U.S. has been that, in almost seven months after 9/11, we still haven't captured Osama bin Laden. With the apprehension this week of one of his top lieutenants, have we gotten enough information to be any closer to maybe finally getting bin Laden? Myers: Well, if you remember, if we go back to the beginning of this segment, the goal has never been to get bin Laden. Obviously, that's desirable. Interesting, I just read a piece by some analysts that said you may not want to go after the top people in these organizations. You may have more effect by going after the middlemen, because they're harder to replace. I don't know if that's true, or not, and clearly we would like to eventually get bin Laden. But I think the fact that we've been able to disrupt operations, get a lot of the people just under him and maybe just a little bit further down, has had some impact on their operations. We know have disrupted, you know, four, five, six, seven active operations that they had planned and probably more that we don't know about. So we're going to keep the hunt on. Finding one person, as we've talked about before, is a very difficult prospect, but we will keep trying. Novak: General, we have less than a minute before we take another break. All the reports are that enlistments for the all-voluntary force have not risen, despite the obvious patriotism in the country since September 15, and they never did -- the enlistments never did rise. How can you explain that? Myers: I don't know whether I can explain it. I do know that enlistments -- we're meeting our enlistment targets right now and our re-enlistment rates for most of the services (Unintelligible). I do know that the morale of the troops that I see in Afghanistan and the surrounding areas is very, very high. Novak: So the enlistment rates don't bother you? Myers: I think -- I think we're fine right now. And I just gave a presentation last night in a school where public service is what they teach. And they said their enrollment is way up because people are very much interested in public service, whether military or in the rest of government. Novak: General Richard Myers, thank you very much.

Al Hunt and I will be back with a comment after these messages. Hunt: Bob, the general gave the official line on Afghanistan. But between the lines, I think you can sense a little bit of concern that picture there really is worrisome. Iranians in the west, heroin on the rise, Karzai really limited to Kabul. I think Holbrooke could be right. We could lose the peace after winning this victory in the war. Novak: I was struck how firmly the general put down Ken Adelman's comments that it could be a cakewalk if the U.S. attacked Iraq. He says there's no cakewalk when you're going against a big army like that. But he also said that the Iraqi army is not what it used to be. The U.S. has a lot more weapons. He kind of indicated that General Scowcroft, talking about 200,000 troops needed was exaggerating a little. Hunt: Well, yeah, and also in response to your question about the campaign 2000, charges about the hallowed army, I guess what we are really seeing is just incredible growth in eight months, Bob, it's a miracle, isn't it? The army is doing awful well. Novak: We shouldn't be sarcastic, but I will say this, you know, we have all heard great speeches of Douglas MacArthur and George S. Patton Jr., and General Myers is not a MacArthur or a Patton, but he is I think a very articulate enunciator of the policy -- of the civilian policy, and I thought he was very effective. I'm Robert Novak. Hunt: And I'm Al Hunt. Novak: Coming up at 7:00 p.m. Eastern on CAPITAL GANG, we'll debate Secretary Powell's diplomacy deployment in the Middle East, and what it means to the Bush administration's foreign policy strategy.

Mueller III, Director, Federal Bureau of Investigation** **Commonwealth Club of California San Francisco, CA April 19, 2002** Thank you, Roy (Eisenhardt) and good afternoon everyone. It's good to be back home. It brings back a lot of wonderful memories. My years in San Francisco were among the most satisfying and enjoyable of my career. It gave me the opportunity to work with some of the finest criminal justice and law enforcement professionals in the country. They taught me a great deal, and it was an honor to serve along side them. As much as I miss San Francisco, I am grateful to have the opportunity to serve in what I believe to be the world's finest law enforcement agency -- the FBI. It is particularly rewarding to serve at this unparalleled moment in history, when America is depending on the FBI more than ever, when protecting the homeland from terrorist attacks has taken on new meaning and new urgency. Like most Americans, I'll never forget the day it all began. I had been on the job exactly one week when word came that a plane had struck the World Trade Center. We rushed down to the FBI's command center, hoping it had been a terrible accident but fearing the worst. Minutes later, we watched in horror as a plane hit the second tower. Then, reality hit even closer to home, when across the Potomac, another plane rammed into the Pentagon. Not long after learning that the third hijacked airliner had gone down, a controller from the Federal Aviation Administration, who was on the phone with his agency, told us more shocking news. A fourth plane had been hijacked. It was heading straight towards the nation's capitol. And it was just 15 minutes away. It was a surreal moment for us all, realizing this plane this flying bomb was headed our way, yet not knowing where it might hit: the White House, the Capitol, a school yard, or FBI Headquarters. As we all know, Flight 93 never made it to Washington. The brave passengers on board including many from the San Francisco Bay area were determined that this flying missile would not reach its target, and", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:020419fbinolaptops911.txt:0:7b8df523adff", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 7000, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "020419fbinolaptops911.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "020419fbinolaptops911", "chunk_index": 1, "text": "capitol.

It was a surreal moment for us all, realizing this plane this flying bomb was headed our way, yet not knowing where it might hit: the White House, the Capitol, a school yard, or FBI Headquarters. As we all know, Flight 93 never made it to Washington. The brave passengers on board including many from the San Francisco Bay area were determined that this flying missile would not reach its target, and they sacrificed their lives to save our city. They are among the true heroes of that day. From those first moments, we in the FBI, like the rest of the nation, knew that the world had changed. And we knew that our institution would never be the same. Our first thought was to do what we'd always done after a terrorist attack: set up command centers and start managing the crisis from a law enforcement perspective; get control of the crime scenes and begin gathering evidence; and deploy our vast investigative force to find out everything we could about the attacks. At the same time, we realized that we had to conduct this investigation somewhat differently. These attacks were not just an act of terror. They were an act of war. The most pressing issue for the FBI and for the nation was to find out who we were at war with, and more importantly, to make sure we were not attacked again. To do that, the FBI began working in concert with its many partners to find out everything we could about the hijackers and how they pulled off their attacks. We ran down literally hundreds of thousands of leads and checked every record we could get our hands on, from flight reservations to car rentals to bank accounts. What emerged from our massive investigation was a sobering portrait of 19 hijackers who carried out their attacks with meticulous planning, extraordinary secrecy, and extensive knowledge of how America works. The plans were hatched and financed overseas, beginning as long as five years ago. Each of the hijackers came from abroad: fifteen from Saudi Arabia, two from the United Arab Emirates, and one each from Lebanon and Egypt. All 19 entered our country legally, and only three had overstayed the legal limits of their visas on the day of the attacks. While here, the hijackers did all they could to stay below our radar. They contacted no known terrorist sympathizers. They committed no egregious crimes. They dressed and acted like Americans, shopping and eating at places like Wal-Mart and Pizza Hut, blending into the woodwork all the while. When four got speeding tickets in the days leading up to September 11th, they remained calm and aroused no suspicion. Since none were known terrorists, law enforcement had no reason to question or detain them. **The hijackers also left no paper trail.", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:020419fbinolaptops911.txt:1:c198fd94fe8f", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 7001, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "020419fbinolaptops911.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "020419fbinolaptops911", "chunk_index": 2, "text": "stay below our radar.

Since none were known terrorists, law enforcement had no reason to question or detain them. **The hijackers also left no paper trail. In our investigation, we have not uncovered a single piece of paper either here in the U.S. or in the treasure trove of information that has turned up in Afghanistan and elsewhere that mentioned any aspect of the September 11th plot. The hijackers had no computers, no laptops, no storage media of any kind.** They used hundreds of different pay phones and cell phones, often with prepaid calling cards that are extremely difficult to trace. And they made sure that all the money sent to them to fund their attacks was wired in small amounts to avoid detection. In short, the terrorists had managed to exploit loopholes and vulnerabilities in our systems, to stay out of sight, and to not let anyone know what they were up to beyond a very closed circle. The investigation was enormously helpful in figuring out who and what to look for as we worked to prevent attacks. It allowed us to see where we as a nation needed to close gaps in our security. And it gave us clear and definitive proof that al Qaeda was behind the strikes. At the same time, we were taking other steps to track down any potential associates who might still be out there. We began to identify individuals whom we needed to question. We went to the flight schools to identify associates of the hijackers. We went to those who run a popular travel website that several of the hijackers used to make their flight reservations. They showed us the patterns the hijackers followed and identified others who fit a similar profile. And we ran down all leads in the hopes that they might turn up associates of the terrorists. Through this process, and with the help of state and local authorities, we interviewed thousands of persons to develop a full picture of the hijackers and others associated with them. In the United States, a number of suspects were detained on federal, state, or local charges; on immigration violations; or on material witness warrants. Ultimately, these and other actions with our partners around the world have helped prevent more terrorist attacks. As the days and weeks went by, though, it became clear that the war on terror had only just begun. Our investigation moved from the events of September 11th to the anthrax attacks, to the foiled shoe bombing on the flight from Paris to Miami, to", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:020419fbinolaptops911.txt:2:796a56b15992", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 7002, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "020419fbinolaptops911.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "020419fbinolaptops911", "chunk_index": 3, "text": "suspects were detained on federal, state, or local charges; on immigration violations; or on material witness warrants.

Our investigation moved from the events of September 11th to the anthrax attacks, to the foiled shoe bombing on the flight from Paris to Miami, to the kidnapping and murder of a Wall Street Journal reporter in Pakistan. Through it all, the FBI had become part and parcel of what is now called \"homeland security,\" a government-wide campaign to protect America from terrorist attacks. And we have been given a critical role to play, one that is redefining much of what we do. The homeland security effort is being waged on many fronts. The law enforcement component is building cases against terrorists in the court of law. The military component is deploying our armed forces to attack terrorist strongholds overseas. The intelligence component is using information and analysis to anticipate and prevent attacks, and to better understand the enemy. The diplomatic component is building an international coalition against terror. The financial component is drying up the pool of funds used by terrorists. And the public health component is preparing now to save lives and protect our communities. Today, the FBI is fully integrated into this campaign. We play a leadership role, of course, in the law enforcement arena. At the same time, we are supporting each of the other components of the campaign and each of its players. In this environment, we realize that what we do to help our colleagues is every bit as important as what we do within our own agency. We are supporting the military, for example, by sharing information and intelligence that we gather in our investigations and in our interviews of prisoners. In some cases, we have also facilitated the capture and arrest of terrorists overseas. We are supporting the intelligence effort by working more closely than ever with our partners in the intelligence community here and around the world to gather and share information. We are developing new tools to make this process easier and more effective. To cut off terrorist funding, we've created a financial review group that is working with many other agencies to investigate shady bank accounts and wire transfers and to develop predictive models that can help target suspicious ones in the future. So far, this group has reviewed over 75,000 transactions and helped freeze millions in terrorist funds worldwide. In the public health area, we continue to investigate any incidents involving biological or chemical agents. Since September 11th, we've not only launched a massive investigation into the anthrax attacks, we've also responded to the 16,000 hoaxes and threats that have followed in their wake.", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:020419fbinolaptops911.txt:3:4730e572dc68", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 7003, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "020419fbinolaptops911.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "020419fbinolaptops911", "chunk_index": 4, "text": "accounts and wire transfers and to develop predictive models that can help target suspicious ones in the future.

Since September 11th, we've not only launched a massive investigation into the anthrax attacks, we've also responded to the 16,000 hoaxes and threats that have followed in their wake. We have also stepped up efforts to work more closely with state and local officials, and we continue to coordinate issues, provide training, and stage exercises. As I'll discuss later, the FBI also plays a role in the diplomatic component through our overseas offices, which work closely with American Embassies and foreign governments. Our role in homeland security builds upon what we have been doing for many years. We're still the lead law enforcement agency for counterterrorism. We're still assessing threats and issuing warnings and advisories to our law enforcement partners and to the American people. We're still leading the multi-agency National Infrastructure Protection Center, a key force in protecting our nation's critical physical and electronic infrastructures. And most of all, our top priority is still prevention. The difference is largely a matter of degree. Terrorists have shown they are willing to go to great lengths to destroy America. We must be willing to go to even greater lengths to stop them. Our worldwide network must be more powerful. Our financial commitment must be stronger. Our techniques and training must be more sophisticated. And our sense of urgency and intensity must be greater. This reality is driven home to me in a very real way each day. Since the attacks, I have briefed President Bush in the Oval Office each morning. Together with George Tenet, the Director of the CIA, we go over what we call the \"threat matrix,\" a list of every threat directed at the US in the past 24 hours. During these briefings, the President is not so much interested in who has been arrested or who has been prosecuted. What the President cares about most is what we in the FBI are doing in concert with our partners to run down each of these threats. He wants to be absolutely sure that we are aggressively pursuing every angle and every lead, so that America never wakes up to another morning like September 11th. George Tenet calls those meetings \"galvanizing.\" He recognizes, as I do, that you simply cannot walk into that briefing without feeling completely confident that your people are on top of every issue. More importantly, you cannot come back day after day without being sure that your agency is taking every step to make prevention both a priority and a reality. In the Bureau, we have taken a long, hard look in the mirror", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:020419fbinolaptops911.txt:4:02ef4aeaf40d", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 7004, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "020419fbinolaptops911.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "020419fbinolaptops911", "chunk_index": 5, "text": "up to another morning like September 11th.

More importantly, you cannot come back day after day without being sure that your agency is taking every step to make prevention both a priority and a reality. In the Bureau, we have taken a long, hard look in the mirror to see how we measure up to this mandate. We see some strong counterterrorism capabilities, expertise that has been refined over time and sharpened by experience. But we also see areas where we could do more. And we are moving forward to address them as quickly as possible. First, we are putting more resources into the fight. As we speak, we are overhauling our counterterrorism operations so that we have twice as many Agents focused on prevention. As we hire nearly one thousand new Agents this year, we are also recruiting the right mix of skills -- primarily computer, scientific, and language -- that we need to fight terror. More resources also means a much stronger presence at major special events. We were out in force, for example, at this week's Boston Marathon. At the Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City, we stationed nearly 1,400 personnel -- about five percent of our workforce -- to support the many professionals devoted to ensuring the safety of the games. We are also expanding and improving our analytic capability. The September 11th terrorists spent a great deal of time and effort figuring out how America works. They knew the ins and outs of our systems. We need to have a complete grasp on how terrorists operate as well. Our analysts do some great work, but we need more of them and we need to do more of the kind of strategic thinking that helps us stay one step ahead of those who would do us harm. Second, we are overhauling our technology. Here in the heart of Silicon Valley, you understand how quickly technology changes and how fast you can be left behind. The fact is, for all the state-of-the-art systems in our lab, for all the high-tech services we provide to law enforcement, the Bureau has simply not kept pace when it comes to the equipment on our desktops. We have computers discarded by other agencies that we took as upgrades. We have systems that cannot talk with other Bureau systems, much less with other federal agencies. We have 34 different investigative applications, none of which are easy to use and all of which must ultimately be integrated. In the wake of September 11th, we have accelerated our plans to fix these problems. We will put in place new hardware this year and we will overhaul our key applications by the end", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:020419fbinolaptops911.txt:5:434d58c1143c", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 7005, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "020419fbinolaptops911.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "020419fbinolaptops911", "chunk_index": 6, "text": "discarded by other agencies that we took as upgrades.

In the wake of September 11th, we have accelerated our plans to fix these problems. We will put in place new hardware this year and we will overhaul our key applications by the end of next year. Our goal is a near paperless environment, a development that will put us light years ahead of where we are today. Technology will also help us share information more quickly and effectively outside the Bureau. We don't have the right systems in place now to make information flow as freely and as seamlessly as we'd like. We're working to create a database one that sits on top of all the others that we can use to share information and intelligence with the outside world. We hope to test it later next year. We're also looking for a way to get information out more quickly and universally. Today, there is no one system no digital pipeline that we can use to send advisories and information to all of law enforcement. We have to do it piecemeal and patchwork. We're working hard to find a solution. Third, effective prevention requires strengthening the defensive infrastructure of the country. This means immigration and customs programs that keep terrorists out, airports that are secure, and seaports that are on alert. We are supporting these efforts wherever we can. It also means a national program where the FBI joins with state and local law enforcement to form a national anti-terror network. There are just over 11,000 Special Agents. There are 650,000 state and local law enforcement officers. An integrated national program that combines our resources and expertise substantially increases the safety of all Americans. Finally, prevention also means something America has not really focused on before September 11th. It means an aggressive -- but rigorously lawful -- program of disruption abroad and at home. The September 11th terrorists had the luxury of time and tranquility to put the pieces of their plan in place. From the training camps of Afghanistan to the universities of Germany to the flight schools of America, they were able to assemble the components of their plan and pick their moment to execute it. We cannot afford them this operational luxury again. For America, prevention must include an international offensive capability in which the intelligence and law enforcement resources of the global community are integrated into a program to disrupt and attack terrorist operations in their infancy. It is this international component, as much as any other ingredient, which heralds a new day for the FBI. In a post 9-11 world, partnerships abroad equal security at home. We are", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:020419fbinolaptops911.txt:6:f2aefce75f12", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 7006, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "020419fbinolaptops911.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "020419fbinolaptops911", "chunk_index": 7, "text": "their moment to execute it.

It is this international component, as much as any other ingredient, which heralds a new day for the FBI. In a post 9-11 world, partnerships abroad equal security at home. We are working to build these partnerships through our 44 overseas offices, what we call Legal Attaches. Today more than ever, they are an important first line of defense against terror. They enable us to build the kind of face-to-face, personal relationships we need to track down terrorists around the globe and root them out of their hiding places. Last month, working through our Legal Attache in Manila, a group of 28 senior level government officials from the Republic of the Philippines came to our National Academy in Virginia for a two-week seminar. They wanted to learn how to knock the financial legs out from under terrorists. One of the participants in the class was Jose Calida, the Undersecretary for the Department of Justice in the Philippines. He decided to give the class a name. He came up with the word \"Balikatan,\" which in his native tongue means \"shoulder-to-shoulder.\" Because when he looked out at the class, that's what he saw: 28 leaders sitting shoulder-to-shoulder with each other and with us, united in a common purpose of defeating terror. Al-Qaeda and other international terrorist groups have developed networks around the world. We need the same kind of networks to defeat them. Even in this age of sophisticated technologies and techniques, it is critically important that we be able to sit down with a colleague and develop a rapport that will ultimately help us build a national and international coalition against terror. That is why our overseas offices are so important and why we need even more of them in the days ahead. As we in the Bureau move through a period of intense change, as we adjust to our new role in homeland security, we must be flexible and open-minded. We can never afford to cling to the status quo. Where our capabilities are strong, they must be stronger. Where problems exist, we must acknowledge them, fix them, and move on. The reality is, change is never smooth or easy. That is especially true for an agency like the FBI, one that is always on the cutting edge, pioneering new tools and techniques to help us catch an increasingly savvy band of criminals.

That is especially true for an agency like the FBI, one that is always on the cutting edge, pioneering new tools and techniques to help us catch an increasingly savvy band of criminals. In the past, though, the FBI has sometimes made problems worse by ignoring or denying them. That can't be the way we do business going forward. We've got to welcome and even embrace constructive criticism. We have to acknowledge problems and be ahead of the curve in fixing them. That has been our approach in recent months, and it will remain our approach. Standing behind all the capabilities that we have now and that we are working to build is a cadre of FBI professionals, men and women who exemplify courage, integrity, respect for the law, and respect for others. We are extremely proud of how they have performed over the past seven months. They have worked long days and nights, sacrificing time with their families to get the job done. They have shown grace under fire in difficult and often dangerous situations. There is one Special Agent, though, who made the ultimate sacrifice for the FBI and for the country he cared about so deeply. His name is Lenny Hatton, and he is one of the many law enforcement professionals lost on September 11th. Lenny was an exceptional Agent and a remarkable man. He was on his way to work on September 11th when he saw the World Trade Center on fire. Instinctively, he went straight to the scene and started working with police and firefighters to evacuate the buildings. He was last seen helping a victim out of one of the buildings, and rushing back in to save more. Several days later at Lenny's funeral Mass, an individual by the name of Chris O'Connell paid tribute to the fallen Agent. Chris talked about how Lenny devoted his life to serving -- as a Marine, as a volunteer firefighter, as an FBI Special Agent, as a husband and father -- and how Lenny had served until his last breath, trying to save lives. In tears, Chris O'Connell closed his eulogy by saying: \"On September 11th, we saw a horrific event in this country and our city. Special Agent Lenny Hatton stood shoulder to shoulder with the finest and the bravest. Until we meet again, my partner, my friend.\" Chris O'Connell was Lenny's partner, and Chris O'Connell was and is a detective with the New York Police Department. Lenny and Chris cared for each other like brothers. It didn't matter to them that one worked for the FBI and one worked for the NYPD. They just wanted to get the job done. They were a team. Lenny Hatton exemplifies what the FBI is really all about: defending freedom through courage, compassion, and cooperation.

But the global search has produced virtually nothing in the way of hard evidence about the terrorists' planning, and authorities said Monday that they now face the growing realization that they may never know many key details. That sobering conclusion underscores the skill and sophistication of the al-Qaida terror network in its ability to conceal its activities -- and the equally daunting difficulties that authorities face in heading off another attack, officials said. **The hijackers \"left no paper trail,\" FBI Director Robert S. Mueller III said in the text of a speech the FBI released Monday. \"In our investigation, we have not uncovered a single piece of paper -- either here in the United States or in the treasure trove of information that has turned up in Afghanistan and elsewhere -- that mentioned any aspect of the Sept. 11 plot.\"** His remarks offer the FBI's most comprehensive and detailed assessment to date of its investigation, remarkable as much for what investigators have not found as for what they have. ** Mueller revealed that investigators believe the Sept. 11 plan may have been in the works for as long as five years, and that the hijackers used \"meticulous planning, extraordinary secrecy and extensive knowledge of how America works\" to conceal their scheme after entering the United States legally from the Middle East. ** ** Investigators have found no computers, laptops, hard drives or other storage media that may have been used by the hijackers, who hid their communications by using hundreds of different pay phones and cell phones, coupled with hard-to-trace prepaid calling cards.** In executing wire transfers to fund the attacks, they were also careful to send money in small amounts,", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:020430latimes911hijackersnolaptops.txt:0:28a394d61082", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 7011, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "020430latimes911hijackersnolaptops.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "020430latimes911hijackersnolaptops", "chunk_index": 1, "text": "extensive knowledge of how America works\" to conceal their scheme after entering the United States legally from the Middle East. ** ** Investigators have found no computers, laptops, hard drives or other storage media that may have been used by the hijackers, who hid their communications by using hundreds of different pay phones and cell phones, coupled with hard-to-trace prepaid calling cards.** In executing wire transfers to fund the attacks, they were also careful to send money in small amounts, avoiding large cash transactions that would have triggered a government report, Mueller said, adding: \"The hijackers did all they could to stay below our radar.\" The FBI and other U.S. intelligence agencies have come under intense scrutiny since Sept. 11, and some analysts suggested that Mueller's comments, made in a speech to the Commonwealth Club in San Francisco on April 19, may reflect an attempt to rationalize the intelligence community's failure to pick up on any signs that an attack was imminent. The White House is deeply concerned about the lack of any evidence that could have foreshadowed the events of Sept. 11, and that is one reason why U.S. counterterrorism authorities intend to keep the nation on an indefinite state of heightened alert, according to a Bush administration official.

Eleven microbiologists mysteriously dead over the span of just five months. Some of them world leaders in developing weapons-grade biological plagues. Others the best in figuring out how to stop millions from dying because of biological weapons. Still others, experts in the theory of bioterrorism. Throw in a few Russian defectors, a few nervy U.S. biotech companies, a deranged assassin or two, a bit of Elvis, a couple of Satanists, a subtle hint of espionage, a big whack of imagination, and the plot is complete, if a bit reminiscent of James Bond. The first three died in the space of just over a week in November. Benito Que, 52, was an expert in infectious diseases and cellular biology at the Miami Medical School. Police originally suspected that he had been beaten on Nov. 12 in a carjacking in the medical school's parking lot. Strangely enough, though, his body showed no signs of a beating. Doctors then began to suspect a stroke. Just four days after Dr. Que fell unconscious came the mysterious disappearance of Don Wiley, 57, one of the foremost microbiologists in the United States. Dr. Wiley, of the Howard Hughes Medical Institute at Harvard University, was an expert on how the immune system responds to viral attacks such as the classic doomsday plagues of HIV, ebola and influenza. He had just bought tickets to take his son to Graceland the following day. Police found his rental car on a bridge outside Memphis, Tenn. His body was later found in the Mississippi River. Forensic experts said he may have had a dizzy spell and have fallen off the bridge. Just five days after that, the", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:020504globeandmail.txt:0:73627604962f", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 7014, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "020504globeandmail.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "020504globeandmail", "chunk_index": 1, "text": "University, was an expert on how the immune system responds to viral attacks such as the classic doomsday plagues of HIV, ebola and influenza. He had just bought tickets to take his son to Graceland the following day. Police found his rental car on a bridge outside Memphis, Tenn. His body was later found in the Mississippi River. Forensic experts said he may have had a dizzy spell and have fallen off the bridge. Just five days after that, the world-class microbiologist and high-profile Russian defector Valdimir Pasechnik, 64, fell dead. The pathologist who did the autopsy, and who also happened to be associated with Britain's spy agency, concluded he died of a stroke. Dr. Pasechnik, who defected to the United Kingdom in 1989, played a huge role in Russian biowarfare and helped to figure out how to modify cruise missiles to deliver the agents of mass biological destruction. The next two deaths came four days apart in December. Robert Schwartz, 57, was stabbed and slashed with what police believe was a sword in his farmhouse in Leesberg, Va. His daughter, who identifies herself as a pagan high priestess, and several of her fellow pagans have been charged. Dr. Schwartz was an expert in DNA sequencing and pathogenic micro-organisms, who worked at the Center for Innovative Technology in Herndon, Va. Four days later, Nguyen Van Set, 44, died at work in Geelong, Australia, in a laboratory accident. He entered an airlocked storage lab and died from exposure to nitrogen. Other scientists at the animal diseases facility of the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization had just come to fame for discovering a virulent strain of mousepox, which could be modified to affect smallpox. Then in February, the Russian microbiologist Victor Korshunov, 56, an expert in intestinal bacteria of children around the world, was bashed over the head near his home in Moscow. Five days later the British microbiologist Ian Langford, 40, was found dead in his home near Norwich, England, naked from the waist down and wedged under a chair. He was an expert in environmental risks and disease. Two weeks later, two prominent microbiologists died in San Francisco. Tanya Holzmayer, 46, a Russian who moved to the U.S. in 1989, focused on the part of the human molecular structure that could be affected best by medicine. She was killed by fellow microbiologist Guyang (Matthew) Huang, 38, who shot her seven times when she opened the door to a pizza delivery. Then he shot himself. The final two deaths came one day after the other in March. David Wynn-Williams, 55, a respected astrobiologist with the British Antarctic Survey, who studied the habits of microbes that might survive in outer space, died in a freak road accident near his home in Cambridge, England. He was hit by a car while he was jogging. The following day, Steven Mostow, 63, known as", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:020504globeandmail.txt:1:7aeb8724ba26", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 7015, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "020504globeandmail.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "020504globeandmail", "chunk_index": 2, "text": "seven times when she opened the door to a pizza delivery.

He was hit by a car while he was jogging. The following day, Steven Mostow, 63, known as Dr. Flu for his expertise in treating influenza, and a noted expert in bioterrorism, died when the airplane he was piloting crashed near Denver. So what does any of it mean? \"Statistically, what are the chances?\" wondered a prominent North American microbiologist reached last night at an international meeting of infectious-disease specialists in Chicago. Janet Shoemaker, director of public and scientific affairs of the American Society for Microbiology in Washington, D.C., pointed out yesterday that there are about 20,000 academic researchers in microbiology in the U.S. Still, not all of these are of the elevated calibre of those recently deceased. She had a chilling, final thought. When microbiologists die in a lab, there's a way of taking note of the deaths and adding them up. When they die in freakish accidents outside the lab, nobody keeps track. Suspicious deaths The sudden and suspicious deaths of 11 of the world's leading microbiologists. Who they were: 1. Nov. 12, 2001: Benito Que was said to have been beaten in a Miami parking lot and died later. 2. Nov. 16, 2001: Don C. Wiley went missing. Was found Dec. 20. Investigators said he got dizzy on a Memphis bridge and fell to his death in a river. 3. Nov. 21, 2001: Vladimir Pasechnik, former high-level Russian microbiologist who defected in 1989 to the U.K. apparently died from a stroke. 4. Dec. 10, 2001: Robert M. Schwartz was stabbed to death in Leesberg, Va. Three Satanists have been arrested. 5. Dec. 14, 2001: Nguyen Van Set died in an airlock filled with nitrogen in his lab in Geelong, Australia. 6. Feb. 9, 2002: Victor Korshunov had his head bashed in near his home in Moscow. 7. Feb. 14, 2002: Ian Langford was found partially naked and wedged under a chair in Norwich, England. 8. 9. Feb. 28, 2002: San Francisco resident Tanya Holzmayer was killed by a microbiologist colleague, Guyang Huang, who shot her as she took delivery of a pizza and then apparently shot himself. 10. March 24, 2002: David Wynn-Williams died in a road accident near his home in Cambridge, England. 11. March 25, 2002: Steven Mostow of the Colorado Health Sciences Centre, killed in a plane he was flying near Denver.

Report Had No Details on Sept. Plot By Dan Eggen and Bill Miller Washington Post Staff Writers Thursday, May 16, 2002; Page A01 ** President Bush and his top advisers were informed by the CIA early last August that terrorists associated with Osama bin Laden had discussed the possibility of hijacking airplanes, according to reliable sources. ** The information, given to Bush as part of his daily intelligence report, lacked specific details about how the terrorist plans would be carried out, the sources said. The White House said last night that law enforcement agencies were quietly placed on alert as a result of the intelligence. White House spokesman Ari Fleischer confirmed that Bush had been told about the possibility of hijackings but he declined to say what had been revealed during his intelligence briefings. \"There was . . . an awareness by the government, including the president, of Osama bin Laden and the threat he posed in the United States and around the world,\" Fleischer said. \"That included long-standing speculation about hijacking in the traditional sense, but not involving suicide bombers using airplanes as missiles.\" A CIA spokesman said the agency routinely passed on intelligence citing the possibility that al Qaeda might be planning to hijack an airliner as part of a terrorist action against the United States. But a suicide attack involving an aircraft was never envisioned, the spokesman said. ** The intelligence briefing on al Qaeda hijackings, first reported last night by CBS News, marks the most detailed disclosure of what Bush was told about the possibility of terror attacks before Sept. 11. It also represents a shift in the official version of events surrounding the attacks on New York and Washington, which Bush and other administration officials have generally characterized as a sneak attack that could not have been foreseen by U.S. intelligence. ** \"It's hard to envision a plot so devious as the one that they pulled off on 9/11,\" Bush said in a January interview with NBC's Tom Brokaw. \"Never did we", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:020515post_memo_bush_white_house_bin_laden_attack_america_9-11.txt:0:48c6c0291b23", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 7018, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "020515post_memo_bush_white_house_bin_laden_attack_america_9-11.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "020515post_memo_bush_white_house_bin_laden_attack_america_9-11", "chunk_index": 1, "text": "the possibility of terror attacks before Sept. 11.

The information provided to Bush was included as part of the president's daily briefing, a highly restricted classified document prepared by the CIA. The document is seen by only a handful of people, White House officials said: Bush, Vice President Cheney, CIA Director George J. Tenet, national security adviser Condoleezza Rice and, less frequently, Chief of Staff Andrew H. Card Jr. Sen. Bob Graham (D-Fla.) said yesterday that he has been told of a CIA document that reached Bush in August, warning him of a more specific al Qaeda attack involving an airliner. Graham, chairman of the Senate intelligence committee, said he had not yet read the document, but that congressional staffers have. Until now, the growing congressional scrutiny of possible warning signs before Sept. 11 has focused on the FBI's actions, including the bureau's handling of a memo written in July 2001 by an agent in Phoenix. A senior U.S. official who has reviewed the classified memo said yesterday that the FBI agent had made a \"strong connection\" between a group of Middle Eastern aviation students he was investigating and Osama bin Laden's al Qaeda network. The link was included in the five-page memorandum sent to FBI headquarters two months before the attacks. The agent was so concerned that he mentioned bin Laden in the first sentence of the memo, which suggested that terrorists from al Qaeda or other groups might be using flight schools to prepare for a hijacking or bombing plot, several officials said. The new details heightened a controversy that developed two weeks ago, when the outline of the agent's memo surfaced in news reports. FBI Director Robert S. Mueller III told a Senate committee last week that he wished the agency had been more aggressive in following up on the memo. But Mueller said doing so would not have led investigators to the Sept. 11 plot, and that none of the aviation students has been connected to the hijackings. The Phoenix office's concerns were never relayed to a separate group of FBI agents in Minnesota, who were scrambling to determine the intentions of French national Zacarias Moussaoui.

The Phoenix office's concerns were never relayed to a separate group of FBI agents in Minnesota, who were scrambling to determine the intentions of French national Zacarias Moussaoui. Moussaoui had been arrested at a flight school in August after he had aroused school officials' suspicions. It was only later that the FBI concluded that Moussaoui, now under indictment, was part of the hijacking conspiracy. **FBI officials have repeatedly declined to release the entire memorandum**, citing its classified status and providing only a one-paragraph portion that describes the agent's suggestion that flight schools nationwide be canvassed for Middle Easterners. It remained unclear yesterday exactly what led the agent to make a link between al Qaeda and the students he was investigating from Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University in Prescott, Ariz. But one source said the memo was \"thorough\" in outlining his concerns. As details emerged, criticism of the FBI intensified on Capitol Hill. Sen. Richard C. Shelby (R-Ala.), the ranking minority member of the Intelligence Committee, yesterday said the Phoenix agent's memo \"was a very important warning and it was not heeded. It was not distributed. It was not acted upon.\" \"That in itself is a damning piece of evidence of the FBI losing an opportunity,\" Shelby said. Combined with the Bush briefing and \"events in Minnesota five weeks later, it's more than damning,\" he said. \"Why didn't the FBI link them? They were either asleep, or inept, or both. What more is it going to take to wake up the FBI?\" Shelby is a leader of a joint House and Senate investigation into the attacks and the performance of the FBI, CIA and other agencies. Three of the Sept. 11 hijackers received training from U.S. flight schools, although none was enrolled at the time of the July 10 memo, officials said. None received training at Embry-Riddle, although Flight 77 suicide pilot Hani Hanjour may have practiced on a flight simulator of a school in Phoenix. During his Senate appearance last week, Mueller stressed that none of those under investigation in Arizona has since been connected to the attacks. That point was reinforced yesterday by Fleischer, who said at a news briefing yesterday that Bush agreed with Mueller that the memo \"in and of itself would not have led to the prevention of the September 11th attacks.\" Sen. Richard J. Durbin (D-Ill.), a member of the Intelligence Committee who has read the memo \"several times,\" said yesterday that the memo \"was very explicit in terms of connecting suspected terrorists in the United States with aviation training schools. That should have been a red flag.\" Durbin also said sentiment is growing in Congress", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:020515post_memo_bush_white_house_bin_laden_attack_america_9-11.txt:2:88a9f3bb486e", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 7020, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "020515post_memo_bush_white_house_bin_laden_attack_america_9-11.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "020515post_memo_bush_white_house_bin_laden_attack_america_9-11", "chunk_index": 3, "text": "yesterday that Bush agreed with Mueller that the memo \"in and of itself would not have led to the prevention of the September 11th attacks.\" Sen.

That should have been a red flag.\" Durbin also said sentiment is growing in Congress for the Bush administration to release the memo, or at least hold classified briefings on it. Sen. Charles E. Grassley (R-Iowa) sent a letter to Mueller yesterday demanding public release of the memo \"to demonstrate that the FBI has nothing to hide and that from this point forward, candor and straight talk will be the FBI's mode of operation.\" Grassley said in an interview that the reference to bin Laden \"is so obvious that it should have gotten more attention.\" * Staff writers Mike Allen and Dana Priest contributed to this report. * © 2002 The Washington Post Company FAIR USE NOTICE: This site contains copyrighted material the use of which has not always been specifically authorized by the copyright owner.

SANGER (NYT) 858 words WASHINGTON, May 15 -- The White House said tonight that President Bush had been warned by American intelligence agencies in early August that Osama bin Laden was seeking to hijack aircraft but that the warnings did not contemplate the possibility that the hijackers would turn the planes into guided missiles for a terrorist attack. ''It is widely known that we had information that bin Laden wanted to attack the United States or United States interests abroad,'' Ari Fleischer, the president's press secretary, said this evening. ''The president was also provided information about bin Laden wanting to engage in hijacking in the traditional pre-9/11 sense, not for the use of suicide bombing, not for the use of an airplane as a missile.'' Nonetheless the revelation by the White House, made in response to a report about the intelligence warning this evening on CBS News, is bound to fuel Congressional demands for a deeper investigation into why American intelligence agencies and the Federal Bureau of Investigation had failed to put together individual pieces of evidence that, in retrospect, now seem to suggest what was coming. In the past few days, government officials have acknowledged for the first time that an F.B.I. agent in Phoenix had urged the F.B.I. headquarters to investigate Middle Eastern men enrolled in American flight schools. That memorandum also cited Mr. bin Laden by name and suggested that his followers could use the schools to train for terror operations, officials who have seen the memorandum said. Administration officials reached this evening said the warning given to Mr. Bush did not come from the F.B.I. or from the information developed by the Phoenix agent. Instead, it was provided as part of the C.I.A. briefing he is given each morning, suggesting that it was probably based on evidence gathered abroad. The C.I.A. had been listening intently over the July 4 holiday last year, after what", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:020516nytimes.txt:0:f45ee831db4b", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 7023, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "020516nytimes.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "020516nytimes", "chunk_index": 1, "text": "schools to train for terror operations, officials who have seen the memorandum said.

Instead, it was provided as part of the C.I.A. briefing he is given each morning, suggesting that it was probably based on evidence gathered abroad. The C.I.A. had been listening intently over the July 4 holiday last year, after what one investigator called ''a lot of static in the system suggesting something was coming.'' But then the evidence disappeared as quickly as it had arisen, and by August, officials have said, little was heard from Al Qaeda. The warning of the hijacking was given to the president at his ranch in Crawford, Tex., where he was on vacation. Taken together, the news of the C.I.A. warning and the information developed separately by the F.B.I. explains Mr. Bush's anger after Sept. 11 that intelligence gathered on American soil and abroad was not being centrally analyzed and that the agencies were not working well together. Several times he has told audiences that he is working on solving that problem, and these days he is briefed jointly by the F.B.I and the C.I.A., ensuring that each hears information from the other agency. It was not clear this evening why the White House waited eight months after the terrorist attacks in New York and Washington to reveal what Mr. Bush had been told. But Mr. Fleischer noted that in the daily flow of intelligence information the president receives, the warning of what appeared to be the threat of a conventional hijacking was not as serious as it appears in retrospect. ''We were a peacetime society, and the F.B.I. had a different mission,'' he said. Mr. Fleischer said the information given to the president in Texas had prompted the administration to put law enforcement agencies on alert. But there was no public announcement. Nonetheless, a senior administration official said tonight that there was speculation within the government that heightened security -- if it truly existed in August and September -- might have prompted the hijackers to use box cutters and plastic knives to avoid detection. The C.I.A. warning might also explain why Mr. Bush's aides were so certain that Mr. bin Laden was behind the attacks almost as soon as they happened. ''We never had any real doubt,'' one senior official involved in the crucial decisions at the White House on Sept. 11 said several months ago. Until recently, Mr. Bush has deflected demands for a lengthy and detailed investigation into the intelligence failures surrounding the Sept. 11 attacks. White House officials were concerned that the investigation would feed into demands by Senator Richard C. Shelby, the Alabama Republican who is the vice chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, for the replacement of George J.", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:020516nytimes.txt:1:87547828e5e6", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 7024, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "020516nytimes.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "020516nytimes", "chunk_index": 2, "text": "any real doubt,'' one senior official involved in the crucial decisions at the White House on Sept. 11 said several months ago.

White House officials were concerned that the investigation would feed into demands by Senator Richard C. Shelby, the Alabama Republican who is the vice chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, for the replacement of George J. Tenet as director of central intelligence. But the news that the hijacking warning was in the president's brief, which Mr. Tenet sees and approves, and that it was linked to Mr. bin Laden is almost certain to widen the scope of the investigation. Already, several lawmakers who have read the Phoenix memorandum written by the F.B.I. agent have described it as the most significant document to emerge in Congressional inquiries into whether the government might have been warned about possible hijackings. Now those investigators are almost certain to demand the details of the president's August briefing by the C.I.A. and may ask to hear about how that evidence was developed.

The group included the Federal Aviation Administration, along with the Coast Guard, FBI, Secret Service and Immigration and Naturalization Service. ** Clarke directed every counterterrorist office to cancel vacations, defer nonvital travel, put off scheduled exercises and place domestic rapid-response teams on much shorter alert. For six weeks last summer, at home and overseas, the U.S. government was at its highest possible state of readiness -- and anxiety -- against imminent terrorist attack. That intensity -- defensive in nature -- did not last. By the time Bush received his briefing at his ranch in Crawford, Tex., on Aug. 6, the government had begun to stand down from the alert. Offensive planning against al Qaeda remained in a mid-level interagency panel, which had spent half a year already in a policy review. The Deputies Committee, the second tier of national security officials, had not finished considering the emerging plan, and Bush's Cabinet-rank advisers were still a month away from their first meeting on terrorism. That took place Sept. 4, a week before hijacked planes were flown into the Pentagon and World Trade Center in synchronized attacks.

But it also portrays a new administration that gave scant attention to an adversary whose lethal ambitions and savvy had been well understood for years. **Director of Central Intelligence George J. Tenet had been \"nearly frantic\" with concern since June 22, according to one frequent interlocutor, and a written intelligence summary for national security adviser Condoleezza Rice said on June 28: \"It is highly likely that a significant al Qaeda attack is in the near future, within several weeks.\" By late summer, one senior political appointee said, Tenet had \"repeated this so often that people got tired of hearing it.\" ** The president's daily briefing, a CIA distillation of noteworthy current intelligence, seldom includes a threat \"so important and so precise that everyone stops in their tracks\" to head it off, one senior foreign policy official said yesterday. The reference to hijacking on Aug. 6, said another source with first-hand knowledge, was speculative and backed by no specific threat report more recent than 1998. But it is also true that Bush and his Cabinet advisers were not yet disposed to respond to al Qaeda as a first-tier national security threat. The alerts of the early and mid-summer -- described by two career counterterrorist officials as the most urgent in decades -- had faded to secondary concern by the time of Bush's extended Crawford vacation. **As late as Sept. 9, Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld threatened a presidential veto when the Senate proposed to divert $600 million to counterterrorism from ballistic missile defense. ** \"I knew he was a menace and I knew he was a problem,\" Bush said of Osama bin Laden in a Dec. 20 interview with The Washington Post. \"I was prepared to look at a plan that would be a thoughtful plan that would bring him to justice, and would have given the order to do that. I have no hesitancy about going after him. But I didn't feel that sense of urgency.\" One major U.S. government error before Sept. 11, according to some counterterrorist officials, was the FBI's failure to share its field reports from aviation schools. A senior FBI official attended Clarke's urgent White House meeting on July 5. He committed the bureau to redoubling contacts with its foreign counterparts and to speed up transcription and analysis of wiretaps obtained under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, among other steps. **But when a field agent in Phoenix reported suspicions of a hijacking plot just five days later, the FBI did not share the report with any other agency. ** \"I'm fit", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:020517post_al_qaeda_attack_9-11.txt:1:d49d510c1a81", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 7028, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "020517post_al_qaeda_attack_9-11.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "020517post_al_qaeda_attack_9-11", "chunk_index": 2, "text": "its field reports from aviation schools.

It's awfully hard to connect the dots if people don't give you the dots.\" The July 10 report from Phoenix was a five-page electronic communication to headquarters outlining links between a group of suspected Middle Eastern terrorists and the Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University in Prescott, Ariz. The agent, whose name has not been divulged, suggested that the FBI should canvass U.S. flight schools for information on other Middle Eastern students. He speculated that bin Laden might be attempting to train operatives to infiltrate the aviation industry. FBI Director Robert S. Mueller III has acknowledged that the bureau should have responded more aggressively to that report. But the FBI did not share it within the interagency Counterterrorism Security Group, which had a \"threat subgroup\" meeting three times a week. According to sources, the Phoenix report reached no further than FBI headquarters and the New York field office. \"Even today I get dozens of reports a day from the CIA and none from the FBI,\" said a government counterterrorism official. \"When an FBI SAC [special agent in charge] sends in a message, it never leaves the bureau. In fact, they can still get in trouble if they show it to you.\" Mueller testified last week that the bureau is cooperating comprehensively with other agencies. He said none of the men under investigation in Arizona have been linked with the Sept. 11 attacks, and that the memo would not have led investigators to unravel the plot. The last concrete hijacking threat report, sources said, came in 1998. A son of Sheikh Omar Abdel Rahman, convicted in 1995 of conspiring to blow up tunnels and other New York City landmarks, was reported to say then that the best way to free his father from a U.S. prison might be to hijack an American plane and exchange the hostages. In the 10 weeks before Sept. 11, most of the thousands of intelligence leads pointed to an attack on Americans or their properties overseas. **\"Most of the al Qaeda network is anticipating an attack,\" said a highly classified analysis at the end of June.** \"Al Qaeda's overt publicity has also raised expectations among its rank and file, and its donors.

We have increased security at U.S. facilities, warned Americans, threatened the Taliban, stretched intelligence collection efforts, caused the arrest of some of those al Qaeda members we have located, and placed consequence management teams on alert.\" On June 22, the military's Central and European Commands imposed \"Force Protection Condition Delta,\" the highest anti-terrorist alert. The next day the State Department ordered all diplomatic posts to convene emergency action committees. The CIA, including the Rome station chief, said the most probable targets included the U.S. Embassy in Italy, the Genoa summit of the Group of Eight leaders in July, and the Vatican -- a threat that caused Bush to change the venue of his meeting with Pope John Paul II to the papal summer residence at Castel Gandolfo outside Rome. On July 3, Tenet made an urgent special request to 20 friendly intelligence services, asking for the arrest of a list of known al Qaeda operatives. As late as July 31, the FAA urged U.S. airlines to maintain a \"high degree of alertness.\" All those alert levels dropped by the time hijackers armed with box cutters took control of four jetliners on the morning of Sept. 11. © 2002 The Washington Post Company FAIR USE NOTICE: This site contains copyrighted material the use of which has not always been specifically authorized by the copyright owner.

The Bush administration has asserted that no one in government had envisioned a suicide hijacking before it happened. White House press secretary Ari Fleischer said the administration was aware of the report prepared by the Library of Congress for the National Intelligence Council, which advises the president and U.S. intelligence on emerging threats. He said the document did not contain direct intelligence pointing toward a specific plot but rather included assessments about how terrorists might strike. \"What it shows is that this information that was out there did not raise enough alarm with anybody,\" Fleischer acknowledged. Former President Clinton, golfing in Hawaii, played down the intelligence value of the 1999 report. \"That has nothing to do with intelligence,\" he said. \"All that it says is they used public sources to speculate on what bin Laden might do. Let me remind you that's why I attacked his training camp and why I asked the Pakistanis to go get him, and why we contracted with some people in Afghanistan to go get him because we thought he was dangerous.\" Also Friday, new information emerged about a memo from the FBI's Phoenix office in July warning headquarters that a large number of Arabs were training at a U.S. flight school. The memo urged that all flight schools nationwide be checked, but the FBI failed to act on the idea before Sept. 11.

The memo urged that all flight schools nationwide be checked, but the FBI failed to act on the idea before Sept. 11. Government officials said Friday that two of the more than half dozen names the FBI Phoenix office identified in the memo were determined by the CIA after Sept. 11 to have links to bin Laden's al-Qaida. Officials said the CIA was not shown the memo before Sept. 11 and even if it had, it did not have the intelligence linking the two men to al-Qaida until after the attacks. The FBI checked the names before Sept. 11 but found no bin Laden ties, the officials added. Former CIA Deputy Director John Gannon, who was chairman of the National Intelligence Council when the 1999 report was written, said officials long have known a suicide hijacking was a threat. \"If you ask anybody could terrorists convert a plane into a missile, nobody would have ruled that out,\" he said. Democrats and some Republicans in Congress raised the volume of their calls to investigate what the government knew before Sept. 11. \"We're going to learn a lot about what the government knew,\" Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton, D-N.Y., said during an appearance in New York. She said she was unaware of the report created in 1999 during her husband's administration. Court transcripts reviewed by The Associated Press show the govern- ment had other warning signs between 1999 and 2001 that bin Laden was sending members of his network to be trained as pilots and was considering airlines as a possible target. The court records show the FBI has known since at least 1999 that Ihab Mohammed Ali, who was arrested in Orlando, Fla., and later named as an unindicted co-conspirator in the 1998 U.S. Embassy bombings in Africa, had been sent for pilot training in Norman, Okla., before working as a pilot for bin Laden. He eventually crashed a plane owned by bin Laden in Sudan that prosecutors alleged was used to transport al-Qaida members and weapons. Ali remains in custody in New York. In February 2001, federal prosecutors told a court they gained information in September 2000 from an associate of Ali's, Moroccan citizen L'Houssaine Kherchtou, that Kherchtou was trained as an al-Qaida pilot in Kenya and attended a meeting in 1993 where an al-Qaida official was briefing Ali on Western air traffic control procedures. The September 1999 report, entitled \"Sociology and Psychology of Terrorism: Who Becomes a Terrorist and Why?\" described suicide hijacking as one of several retribution attacks the al-Qaida might seek for a 1998 U.S. airstrike against bin Laden's camps in Afghanistan.

MEMO; ASHCROFT LEARNED OF AGENT'S ALERT JUST AFTER 9/11 By DAVID JOHNSTON and DON VAN NATTA Jr. (NYT) 1941 words WASHINGTON, May 20 -- Attorney General John Ashcroft and the F.B.I. director, Robert S. Mueller III, were told a few days after the Sept. 11 attacks that the F.B.I. had received a memorandum from its Phoenix office the previous July warning that Osama bin Laden's followers could be training at American flight schools, government officials said today. But senior Bush administration officials said neither Mr. Ashcroft nor Mr. Mueller briefed President Bush and his national security staff until recently about the Phoenix memorandum. Nor did they tell Congressional leaders. The disclosure is certain to magnify criticism of the F.B.I.'s performance, including its failure to act on the memorandum before the attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon. The two men have not said publicly when they learned of the July 10 memorandum, but the officials said that within days of the attacks senior law enforcement officials grasped the document's significance as a potentially important missed signal. Today, several F.B.I. and Justice Department officials said that in the chaotic days after the attacks, discussions between Mr. Ashcroft and Mr. Mueller were hurried and that their recollection of events were somewhat blurred by the frenetic pace of activity. Some officials said they recalled high-level discussions about how the hijackers had attended American flight schools, but one Justice Department official did not recall a briefing about the memorandum. Spokesmen for Mr. Mueller and Mr. Ashcroft would not discuss the issue today. A senior Justice Department official said, ''The attorney general was not briefed in any detail or with any specificity about the document known as the Phoenix memo until about a month ago.'' Ari Fleischer, the White House press secretary, who was traveling today with the president in Miami, said, ''We have nothing that indicates the president had seen or even heard about this memo prior to a few weeks ago.''

Ari Fleischer, the White House press secretary, who was traveling today with the president in Miami, said, ''We have nothing that indicates the president had seen or even heard about this memo prior to a few weeks ago.'' Mr. Bush's national security adviser, Condoleezza Rice, said last Thursday that the president had not heard about the memorandum before the hijackings and had only recently learned of it. ''I personally became aware of it just recently,'' Ms. Rice said, adding that she had asked Mr. Mueller and George J. Tenet, the director of central intelligence, to review the matter. The Phoenix memorandum, written by Kenneth Williams, an agent in Phoenix, was sent to F.B.I. headquarters as an electronic computer message on July 10. It was reviewed by midlevel supervisors, who headed the agency's bin Laden and Islamic extremist counterterrorism units. But the officials said the memorandum was never sent to top F.B.I. managers, including Thomas J. Pickard, who was acting director in the summer of 2001 before Mr. Mueller took over early in September. Other senior officials were unaware of the memorandum before Sept. 11, including Michael Rolince, who managed the bureau's international terrorism unit, and Dale Watson, his superior, the officials said. The issue of when top officials knew of the Phoenix memorandum is emerging as a main focus in Congressional inquiries getting under way. Senator Patrick J. Leahy, Democrat of Vermont and chairman of the Judiciary Committee, has asked the F.B.I. to identify anyone at the agency who knew about the memorandum before the attacks. But lawmakers also want to know when Bush administration officials learned about the memorandum after the attacks. Some lawmakers have asked whether administration officials were told about it soon after the attacks, but were slow to disclose it. Several lawmakers, including Richard C. Shelby, a senior member of the Senate Intelligence Committee, have already singled out the F.B.I. for blunt criticism after Mr. Williams's memorandum came to light several weeks ago. The Phoenix memorandum is one of two documents under heavy scrutiny by Congressional investigators. The other is a daily intelligence report, shown to Mr. Bush on Aug. 6. The report mentions the threat of Qaeda members' carrying out hijackings in the United States. The White House has refused to produce the document, and administration officials have said that the information was too vague to act on. Mr. Mueller has acknowledged that the bureau's failure to evaluate the Phoenix memorandum fully was an analytical failure that the F.B.I. has tried to correct. ''It is a very worthwhile process and a process we are undertaking to change what we do in response to that", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:020521nytimes.txt:1:0530d52de753", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 7036, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "020521nytimes.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "020521nytimes", "chunk_index": 2, "text": "threat of Qaeda members' carrying out hijackings in the United States.

''It is a very worthwhile process and a process we are undertaking to change what we do in response to that instance and others where perhaps we did not have the analytical capability,'' Mr. Mueller said at a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing on May 8. ''We did not have the people who were looking at the broader picture to put the pieces in place,'' he said, adding that nothing in the memorandum would have enabled the F.B.I. to thwart the attacks. The memorandum remains classified, and much of its contents are unknown. But officials have confirmed that it expressed concern that Mr. bin Laden and other groups could be using the flight schools to prepare for terror attacks. It urged F.B.I. officials to check the visas of foreigners at American aviation academies. But no action was taken before Sept. 11. The memorandum was sent to counterterrorism offices in two cities -- one copy went to John O'Neill, then the top counterterrorism agent in the F.B.I.'s New York office. Mr. O'Neill retired from the F.B.I. in late August. He had just begun a job as the security chief of the World Trade Center when he was killed in the attacks. Usually, internal investigative proposals that involve agencywide resources are reviewed by high F.B.I. officials. But in this case F.B.I. officials have said that officials who read the memorandum were distracted by other cases, a plot against American interests in France and the investigation of the attack in October 2000 on the destroyer Cole. Two or three days after the attacks, Dale Watson, who was then assistant director for counterterrorism, brought the memorandum to the attention of Mr. Pickard, who had returned to his job as deputy director after a stint as acting director, officials said. Mr. Pickard and several other agents then briefed Mr. Mueller and Mr. Ashcroft on its existence, the officials said. The Phoenix agent's memorandum was not based on intelligence but on concerns and recommendations based on ''conjecture and assumptions,'' said a senior official who has read it. ''There appeared to be a lot of Middle Eastern guys taking flying lessons in the Phoenix area,'' the official said. ''This was just a good investigator taking a look at something. It was pure hunch.'' For that reason, the official speculated that the memorandum had not set off strong alarms among other law enforcement officials who had reviewed it at the bureau.

For that reason, the official speculated that the memorandum had not set off strong alarms among other law enforcement officials who had reviewed it at the bureau. Officials at the Central Intelligence Agency have said that they did not receive a copy of the memorandum until several weeks ago. But F.B.I. officials have said that the names of Middle Eastern men in the Phoenix area who were identified in the memorandum, were referred to the C.I.A. in the summer of 2001. F.B.I. officials have said that the C.I.A. reported back that none of the men appeared to be connected to Al Qaeda. Intelligence officials, however, have said that two or three of the men have recently been linked to the Qaeda network. These men remain at large, the officials said. Uncertainty Surrounds Memo Following are comments from President Bush's national security adviser, Condoleezza Rice, and the director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, Robert S. Mueller III, about how the administration and the bureau handled a memorandum by an F.B.I. agent warning that Osama bin Laden's followers could be training at flight schools. Ms. Rice's statements came from a White House news briefing last Thursday, and Mr. Mueller's came from testimony on May 8 to the Senate Judiciary Committee. From Ms. Rice As you might imagine, a lot of things are prepared within agencies. They're distributed internally, they're worked on internally. It's unusual that anything like that would get to the president. He doesn't recall seeing anything. I don't recall seeing anything of this kind. Neither the president nor I have recollection of ever hearing about the Phoenix memo in the time prior to Sept. 11. We've asked F.B.I., C.I.A., our own people to go back and see whether or not it's possible that it somehow came to him. I personally became aware of it just recently. From Mr. Mueller ABOUT THE AGENT'S MEMO -- I think the recommendations of the agent are something that we should have more aggressively pursued. I do not believe that it gave a signpost of that which would happen on Sept. 11. He made a recommendation that we initiate a program to look at flight schools that was received at headquarters. It was not acted on by Sept. 11. I should say in passing that even if we had followed those suggestions at that time, it would have not given what we know since Sept. 11 had enabled us to prevent the attacks of Sept. 11. WHO SAW THE MEMO -- I am not certain as to the highest-level individual who received it. I do not believe at this juncture that it went so high as the director of the", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:020521nytimes.txt:3:61ac86720c22", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 7038, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "020521nytimes.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "020521nytimes", "chunk_index": 4, "text": "headquarters.

WHO SAW THE MEMO -- I am not certain as to the highest-level individual who received it. I do not believe at this juncture that it went so high as the director of the F.B.I. But I am not certain how high it went in the hierarchy. ON CHECKING ALL FLIGHT SCHOOLS -- It was a monumental undertaking. There are more than 2,000 aviation academies in the United States. The latest figure I think I heard is something like 20,000 students attending them. And it was perceived that this would be a monumental undertaking without any specificity as to particular persons. The individuals who are being investigated by that agent in Phoenix were not the individuals that were involved in the Sept. 11 attack. REGRETS ABOUT NOT DOING MORE -- So, do I wish we had more aggressively followed up on that suggestion at the time? Yes. Are we taking steps to address what the failings and weaknesses were prior to Sept. 11? Absolutely.

TYLER and NEIL MacFARQUHAR (NYT) 1303 words CAIRO, June 3 -- Egyptian intelligence warned American officials about a week before Sept. 11 that Osama bin Laden's network was in the advance stages of executing a significant operation against an American target, President Hosni Mubarak said in an interview on Sunday. Using a secret agent they had recruited who was in close contact with the bin Laden organization, Mr. Mubarak said, his intelligence chiefs tried unsuccessfully to halt the operation. Mr. Mubarak said his intelligence officials had no indication what the target would be and had no idea of the magnitude of the coming attack. ''We didn't know that such a thing could take place,'' he said, referring to the Sept. 11 attacks. ''We thought it was an embassy, an airplane, something, the usual thing.'' But, he added, to discover after the event that the terrorists were going to take airplanes and destroy buildings, ''that is unbelievable.'' Still, Mr. Mubarak's disclosure represents the first time a foreign leader has said that an intelligence service had penetrated Mr. bin Laden's network, Al Qaeda, to the extent that discussions about specific operations -- and whether they could be halted or postponed -- were under way. Mr. Mubarak did not say whether he knew how American counterterrorism officials had reacted to the Egyptian warning, which a senior United States intelligence official denied was received. But Mr. Mubarak said he believed that security at the United States Embassy in Cairo was tightened in early September as a result of the warning. ''We informed them about everything,'' he said, referring to American intelligence officials. Mr. Mubarak cited the warning as evidence that Egypt has become an increasingly valuable intelligence partner to the United States in the war against terrorism, especially since Sept. 11. It seemed possible he was seeking to burnish Egypt's credentials, which have been questioned in Congress, in advance of his visit to", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:020604nytimes.txt:0:f80c892f72d4", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 7040, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "020604nytimes.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "020604nytimes", "chunk_index": 1, "text": "the United States Embassy in Cairo was tightened in early September as a result of the warning. ''We informed them about everything,'' he said, referring to American intelligence officials. Mr. Mubarak cited the warning as evidence that Egypt has become an increasingly valuable intelligence partner to the United States in the war against terrorism, especially since Sept. 11. It seemed possible he was seeking to burnish Egypt's credentials, which have been questioned in Congress, in advance of his visit to Washington this week. ''Maybe some congressmen were thinking, 'What is Egypt doing?' '' for the United States, he said. ''There are so many things we cannot say. Mainly intelligence information. We did a lot, but sometimes you have to do it quietly.'' A White House spokesman declined to comment on Mr. Mubarak's remarks. The senior United States intelligence official, however, said the Central Intelligence Agency had not received any warnings from Egypt about a possible attack in the days before Sept. 11. ''The Egyptians gave us some threat information, earlier in 2001, of possible attacks against U.S. or Egyptian interests,'' the official said. ''There was nothing about hijackings, nothing about an attack inside the U.S. It did not come in the days before 9/11.'' Mr. Mubarak's statements come as indications grow that American officials were slow to interpret emerging signs of a Qaeda plot well before the attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon. Last week, Robert S. Mueller III, the director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, acknowledged lapses in his agency. And on Sunday, government officials disclosed that the C.I.A. had learned about a Sept. 11 hijacker's connections to Al Qaeda many months before the attacks. By Mr. Mubarak's recollection, Egyptian intelligence officials informed American intelligence officers some time between March and May of 2001 of Egypt's penetration of the bin Laden organization through the agent. While he referred in the interview broadly to ''American intelligence,'' United States officials say the intelligence relationship between Egypt and the United States is handled through the C.I.A. station chief at the embassy in Cairo. The agent established such close contact with Mr. bin Laden's organization that Egyptian officials tried to use the agent's influence to stop the attack. ''We knew that something was going to happen,'' Mr. Mubarak said. ''We had good contact'' with shadowy figures who had information about the bin Laden group's activities. ''We started to use them, to tell them, 'You can stop this,' '' using any pretext, the president added, to try ''to give ourselves time to realize what may take place.'' The Egyptian president said his intelligence chiefs believed, based on the agent's information, that ''something is going to happen in the U.S.'' or ''to the United States, maybe inside the U.S., maybe in an airplane, maybe in embassies'' outside the United States. ''We couldn't know, we tried to know where, but this information''", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:020604nytimes.txt:1:bb7557f8735b", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 7041, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "020604nytimes.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "020604nytimes", "chunk_index": 2, "text": "them, to tell them, 'You can stop this,' '' using any pretext, the president added, to try ''to give ourselves time to realize what may take place.'' The Egyptian president said his intelligence chiefs believed, based on the agent's information, that ''something is going to happen in the U.S.'' or ''to the United States, maybe inside the U.S., maybe in an airplane, maybe in embassies'' outside the United States. ''We couldn't know, we tried to know where, but this information'' never reached them. ''I think this man, this agent, phoned the group of bin Laden, I don't remember who it was,'' Mr. Mubarak said. The agent was told, ''No, no, no, it's difficult to stop it.'' By this time, the president added, ''it was one week before'' Sept. 11. ''Because the wheels were going on, we couldn't stop it. One week or four days, a very short time.'' At a minimum, Mr. Mubarak's account adds detail and drama to a list of warnings about potential terrorist attacks that American intelligence agencies fielded in the days, weeks and months before Sept. 11. Today, an Egyptian official, commenting on warnings about the Sept. 11 attacks, said, ''There were indications that something was being prepared.'' ''There was information about some people planning an operation in the United States, against the United States, but you could not pinpoint where, how, when,'' the official said. The official noted that there had been extensive cooperation between the two countries' intelligence services after the attacks, with the Egyptians helping even in such seemingly mundane matters as sorting out the welter of Arab names used by the hijackers. He declined to be more specific about further cooperation. For years, Egypt's security services, like Jordan's and Saudi Arabia's, have closely cooperated with the C.I.A. on security issues. After the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in 1979, Anwar el-Sadat, who was then the Egyptian president, opened the country's warehouses of Soviet-made weapons to the Carter administration to equip mujahedeen fighters in Afghanistan. After Mr. Sadat was assassinated in 1981, Mr. Mubarak continued the close cooperation. Through the 1980's, the C.I.A. also worked closely with Egypt to thwart Libyan military pressure on Sudan. Counterterrorist cooperation has been a longstanding feature of the secret cooperation. More recently, in late September, Mr. Mubarak said, Egyptian intelligence services told the United States of a plot by bin Laden associates to kill President Bush and other leaders who met in July in Genoa, Italy. In describing the intelligence activities, Mr. Mubarak assumed some risk himself. Islamic fundamentalists tried to assassinate him several years ago, and the killers of his predecessor were Muslim extremists. Egypt's top intelligence officer, Omar Suleiman, has become one of Mr. Mubarak's indispensable envoys, traveling to Washington this month to gather political intelligence on what Mr. Bush wanted to discuss with Mr. Mubarak during his visit and conferring with C.I.A. officials about how", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:020604nytimes.txt:2:64d9ca0da25c", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 7042, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "020604nytimes.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "020604nytimes", "chunk_index": 3, "text": "leaders who met in July in Genoa, Italy.

Mr. Suleiman also traveled to the occupied West Bank last week to get a progress report on how Mr. Arafat was implementing those reforms. Western officials here say that Egyptian intelligence officers have penetrated most of the Islamic fundamentalist groups that operate here. Still, the Egyptian leader expressed strong concern that a rising tide of anti-Americanism and the unresolved Palestinian crisis would lead to an escalation of terrorism in the region and around the world. ''I am afraid of what's happening in the Middle East for the future,'' he said. ''the seriousness of the situation'' may ''generate new kinds of terrorism against all of us, against the U.S., against Egypt, against Jordan.''

June 09, 2002 MI6 warned US of Al-Qaeda attacks Nicholas Rufford MI6 warned the American intelligence services about a plot to hijack aircraft and crash them into buildings two years before the September 11 attacks. Liaison staff at the American embassy in Grosvenor Square in London were passed a secret report by MI6 in 1999 after the intelligence service picked up indications from human intelligence sources (Humint) that Osama Bin Laden's followers were planning attacks in which civilian aircraft could be used in \"unconventional ways\". Information did not specify targets and would not necessarily have enabled US agencies to prevent attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon, intelligence sources said. Details of the MI6 warning, expected to emerge during secret Congressional hearings this week in Washington into alleged intelligence failings, will increase pressure on the Bush administration for a radical shake-up of America's counterterrorism efforts. President George W Bush has already announced plans for a new \"homeland defence department\" with a 25 billion annual budget to combat terrorism. \"We need to know when warnings were missed or signs unheeded - not to point the finger of blame, but to make sure we correct any problems,\" he said last week. MI6 had information as early as 1998 that Al-Qaeda was plotting fresh attacks. A series of warnings was passed to Washington, some concerning threats to American interests in Europe, including the US embassy in Paris. One message detailed heightened activity by suspected Al-Qaeda terror cells. \"The Americans knew of plans to use commercial aircraft in unconventional ways, possibly as flying bombs,\" said a senior Foreign Office source. A US government spokesman declined to comment. Police in London last week deployed for the first time on the British mainland new anti-suicide attack steps after Scotland Yard sent a delegation to meet security experts in Israel. Israeli-style barriers consisting of articulated lorries loaded with concrete were placed across Waterloo bridge to prevent a would-be terrorist from driving into the state coach as the Queen travelled to a jubilee service at St Paul's cathedral.

Kenneth Williams, fresh from the F.B.I. Academy, came as a rookie agent and would soon become the terrorism expert at the bureau's office here. Hani Hanjour, only 18, came to study English, and later flying. He would become a terrorist. Their paths would apparently never intersect. In his years in Arizona, Mr. Hanjour overcame the mediocrity of his talents as a pilot and gained enough expertise to fly a Boeing 757 into the Pentagon. But according to former agents, Mr. Williams could not overcome the limitations placed on him, namely a Phoenix field office whose commitment to fighting terrorism did not match his own. **In recent months, Mr. Williams has earned national praise after the disclosure that senior officials of the Federal Bureau of Investigation ignored his memorandum last July calling for a nationwide canvass of flight students from the Middle East.** The rejection of that memo, combined with the whistle-blower testimony of Coleen Rowley, an agent in the bureau's Minneapolis office, has created the impression of a Washington bureaucracy impeding the work of the offices in the field. But an examination of Mr. Williams's tenure as an agent, and of Mr. Hanjour's simultaneous flight training, shows that many problems now attributed to F.B.I. headquarters also existed in Arizona. For much of the 1990's, some former agents say, the Arizona division, preoccupied with fighting drugs, treated international terrorism as a low priority, even though Tucson had been one of the nation's earliest hubs for radical Muslim groups. ''This has always been the lowest priority in the division; it still is the lowest priority in the division,'' said James Hauswirth,", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:020619nytimes.fbiagentphoenix.txt:0:7a0b17865ff0", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 7047, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "020619nytimes.fbiagentphoenix.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "020619nytimes.fbiagentphoenix", "chunk_index": 1, "text": "and of Mr. Hanjour's simultaneous flight training, shows that many problems now attributed to F.B.I. headquarters also existed in Arizona.

''This has always been the lowest priority in the division; it still is the lowest priority in the division,'' said James Hauswirth, who retired from the Phoenix office in 1999 but stays in contact with other agents. Last December, Mr. Hauswirth wrote a letter to the bureau's director, Robert S. Mueller III, criticizing the way terrorism was handled by the Arizona division, which comprises the bureau's several offices in the state, the main one here. Only last year the Phoenix office, citing budget cutbacks, disbanded the surveillance unit often used by the division's terrorism squad. And Mr. Williams, regarded as the best terrorism agent in the office, had to interrupt his pre-Sept. 11 investigation of Middle Eastern flight students in order to spend six months on a high-profile arson case. He filed his flight-student memo to Washington a month after the arson case was solved. ''He fought it,'' Mr. Hauswirth said of that assignment. ''Why take your best terrorism investigator and put him on an arson case? He didn't have a choice.'' Guadalupe Gonzalez, since 1998 the special agent in charge of the Phoenix office, defends the handling of international terrorism on his watch. Mr. Gonzalez agrees that the top priority in the office before Sept. 11 was fighting drugs, because of Arizona's standing as a busy transshipment point for narcotics from Mexico. Still, he says, he and other supervisors did not neglect efforts against terrorism. ''I think the work that was done in Arizona was good,'' said Mr. Gonzalez, who is leaving the office in August to take over the Dallas office. ''It's kind of like timing. If Sept. 11 had been a year later, maybe other things would have evolved. It's like guessing. We can all guess about what could have happened.'' Resources to fight terrorism were limited, however. The Arizona division grew enormously during the 1990's, partly because of antidrug programs like the Southwest Border Initiative. Of the division's current total of 230 agents, Mr. Gonzalez said, roughly 60 are dedicated to drug work, while about 16 handle international and domestic terrorism, a task that includes monitoring domestic militias; one former agent says the number of agents dedicated to guarding against international terrorism is about eight. In last year's annual ranking of office priorities, Mr. Gonzalez said, drugs ranked first, international terrorism fourth. One former Arizona agent, Roger Browning, who retired in 2000, said the fact that the Phoenix office dedicated substantial resources to customary crime fighting was understandable. But he questioned whether the F.B.I. needed to be so", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:020619nytimes.fbiagentphoenix.txt:1:f3fa2bc0a6aa", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 7048, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "020619nytimes.fbiagentphoenix.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "020619nytimes.fbiagentphoenix", "chunk_index": 2, "text": "and domestic terrorism, a task that includes monitoring domestic militias; one former agent says the number of agents dedicated to guarding against international terrorism is about eight.

One former Arizona agent, Roger Browning, who retired in 2000, said the fact that the Phoenix office dedicated substantial resources to customary crime fighting was understandable. But he questioned whether the F.B.I. needed to be so heavily involved in drug work -- the domain of the Drug Enforcement Administration -- and said agents wasted too many hours on tasks like chasing deadbeat dads. **Fear and Frustration ** Mr. Hanjour, who remains the least known of the four men believed to have piloted the hijacked airliners, has often been described as meek and hesitant, hardly the sort to attract F.B.I. scrutiny. He first came to Arizona in 1990 to visit a brother in Tucson who had arranged for him to take an eight-week English course. He soon returned to his native Saudi Arabia to work on a family farm, and his time in Tucson appears to have been uneventful. But if Mr. Hanjour had apparently not yet come in contact with terrorist groups, the Tucson he visited in 1990 was already a well-established stop for Islamic militants. During the 1980's, their enemy had been the Soviet Union, which had invaded Afghanistan. Alkhifa, a group that recruited fighters and raised money for the jihad in Afghanistan, had one of its three American offices in Tucson. Federal authorities believe that by 1990, after the Soviets retreated from Afghanistan, Osama bin Laden had absorbed Alkhifa into Al Qaeda, his new terrorist organization. Mr. Williams, now 42, a graying and mild-mannered man who declined to be interviewed for this article, did not initially join the Arizona division's international-terrorism squad in 1990. A former police officer, he spent about a year working criminal cases, the sort of work that ambitious agents pursue to build a résumé of arrests and drug seizures. He joined the international-terrorism squad about a year later and also worked on the SWAT team. There was soon tantalizing evidence that Islamic extremists were becoming ever more active in Arizona. In Mr. Hauswirth's letter to Mr. Mueller last December, he cited a 1994 incident in which F.B.I. agents used an informer to monitor a Middle Eastern man who had come to Arizona from New Mexico. The man was believed to be connected to Sheik Omar Abdul Rahman, the Islamic cleric now serving a life sentence for his involvement in a failed plot to bomb New York City landmarks. One day, the suspect drove the informer to a desolate stretch of desert and instructed him on using explosive devices. An F.B.I. surveillance team was videotaping the encounter from atop a nearby mountain.

An F.B.I. surveillance team was videotaping the encounter from atop a nearby mountain. Former agents say they do not know the outcome of that investigation, and Mr. Gonzalez, the agent in charge here, declined to comment. Mr. Williams was continuing his work on the international-terrorism squad in 1996 when Mr. Hanjour returned to Arizona that October. Mr. Hanjour spent substantial periods of time in the state for the next five years, attending at least four flight schools and logging hundreds of hours in the air before earning his license. He was a poor student who often disappeared for weeks or months before resuming his training. ''He wasn't very committed,'' said a former flight instructor who worked with him. ''It took him almost a good three or four years to finish whatever he was doing.'' **Inside the cockpit, the former instructor said, Mr. Hanjour was unsure of himself, even frightened, particularly during mandatory stalling exercises, in which an engine is turned off so that a pilot can practice righting the plane and restoring power. The instructor said he had reassured Mr. Hanjour that ''we're not going to fall out of the sky as long as we have wings.'' ** **But ''he was very scared,'' the instructor added. ''He felt very hesitant. He was not one I would send my wife and my kids with.'' ** Yet, through accumulation of flying hours, Mr. Hanjour apparently built his competency. By the spring of 1999, seeking a commercial license, he was training on simulators at another school and ''doing pretty well,'' the former instructor said. On April 15, 1999, he earned a ''satisfactory'' rating by an examiner from the Federal Aviation Administration and was awarded a commercial license with a multiengine rating. **Roads Not Taken ** Meanwhile, former agents say, Mr. Williams and other international-terrorism agents were becoming increasingly frustrated. In 1999, one of Mr. Williams's former informers sued him and the F.B.I. for $17,217, accusing the bureau of failing to pay him fully for expenses and salary after a year of work in a fraud and terrorism investigation. The plaintiff said in court documents that two agents had told him that a new administrator in the office had slashed the budget. **By early 2000, Mr. Williams had received a tip that would ultimately lead to his memo to Washington. He began to investigate Middle Eastern students at a flight school in Prescott, about two hours from Phoenix, and became suspicious that they might be terrorists.** But by the account of a former agent, Mr. Williams", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:020619nytimes.fbiagentphoenix.txt:3:97fda4c60dee", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 7050, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "020619nytimes.fbiagentphoenix.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "020619nytimes.fbiagentphoenix", "chunk_index": 4, "text": "and terrorism investigation.

He began to investigate Middle Eastern students at a flight school in Prescott, about two hours from Phoenix, and became suspicious that they might be terrorists.** But by the account of a former agent, Mr. Williams soon requested a transfer from the international-terrorism squad to a related team, foreign counterintelligence. He had apparently become worn out by internal politics. ''He was going home with knots in his stomach,'' Mr. Hauswirth said. ''It shouldn't have been that way. Here's a guy who was one of the best terrorism agents in the F.B.I., and he's got to fight city hall.'' Lured by a new supervisor, Mr. Williams returned to the international-terrorism squad in December 2000, but reopening the flight student investigation would have to be delayed. The entire squad was detached to work on a string of high-profile arson cases. In hindsight, that decision has prompted second-guessing, particularly since the best chance to catch Mr. Hanjour would soon present itself. **In February 2001, Mr. Hanjour enrolled at a Phoenix flight school for advanced simulator training to learn how to fly an airliner, a far more complicated task than he had faced in earning a commercial license. At the school, since closed, no one suspected that he was a terrorist. But instructors thought he was so bad a pilot and spoke such poor English that they contacted the Federal Aviation Administration to verify that his license was not a fake.** The aviation agency verified the license and offered to find Mr. Hanjour a language tutor. But it would be four more months before Mr. Williams again focused on flight students. Flight schools in Phoenix say the F.B.I. never contacted them with any concerns about Middle Eastern students. Similarly the aviation agency says its office in Scottsdale, outside Phoenix, never got any notification. So rather than contact the F.B.I., the flight school where Mr. Hanjour was enrolled simply informed him that he was unqualified for the program and so could not earn an airliner license. He decided to continue to train on the simulator for a while anyway. When the arson case was solved last June, Mr. Williams returned to his investigation of the flight students. It would turn out that he was focused on the wrong men. His primary subject, an often-strident Zakaria Soubra, belonged to a British group that espouses the creation of a single Islamic state worldwide. His lawyer maintains that Mr. Soubra is against violence, and though he was detained in May for an immigration violation, he has not been charged with any crime or connected to the attacks. Still, Mr. Hauswirth, for one, questions whether", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:020619nytimes.fbiagentphoenix.txt:4:9641aa92bcc2", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 7051, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "020619nytimes.fbiagentphoenix.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "020619nytimes.fbiagentphoenix", "chunk_index": 5, "text": "his investigation of the flight students.

Still, Mr. Hauswirth, for one, questions whether using Mr. Williams on the arson case prevented him from further investigating flight students in the Phoenix area. When the attacks came on Sept. 11, international terrorism immediately became the top priority in Phoenix and every other F.B.I. field office. Mr. Williams was placed in charge of the Arizona investigation, with the entire Arizona division working round the clock. But it was apparent that the investigators were starting from scratch. Agents quickly pieced together Mr. Hanjour's training history and ultimately detained a group of Middle Eastern men who had trained at another flight school in the Phoenix area where Mr. Hanjour had most recently signed up for simulator time. But none have been linked to the attacks, and most seem to have known Mr. Hanjour only in passing.

Some 1,200 South Asian and Arab men were arrested in sweeps after the terrorist attacks, and 750 of them were ultimately detained on immigration violations, the Justice Department said. As of four weeks ago, when the latest head count was released, all but 74 had been expelled to their home countries or, in a handful of cases, released to resume their lives in the United States. The government, citing national security concerns, has refused to disclose the names of those foreigners it held in detention, including the vast majority who were never charged with anything other than overstaying a visa. It has also banned the public from the deportation hearings of \"special interest detainees\" once it has finished investigating them. The secret detentions and secret hearings have been attacked in federal lawsuits filed by civil liberties groups in Washington, D.C., New Jersey and Michigan, and those cases continue to wend their way through the judicial system. \"The fact that many of the so-called 9/11 detainees have been deported in no way diminishes the significance of the current legal challenges,\" said Lee Gelernt, a lawyer at the American Civil Liberties Union, adding that some detainees are still affected by the government's secrecy policies. The group's lawsuits asked for the names of all detainees, whether they were still in the country or not. Federal district judges have ruled against the government's blanket closing of hearings and refusal to release detainees' names. The Justice Department prevailed in just one instance so far. The New Jersey Supreme Court on Tuesday let stand an appellate decision against the disclosure of names. Civil liberties groups and Muslim-American organizations have complained for months about the treatment of the foreigners picked up after Sept. 11, the lack of information given to the prisoners' relatives and the", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:020711nytimes.txt:0:c734e5e33ef6", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 7054, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "020711nytimes.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "020711nytimes", "chunk_index": 1, "text": "country or not.

Civil liberties groups and Muslim-American organizations have complained for months about the treatment of the foreigners picked up after Sept. 11, the lack of information given to the prisoners' relatives and the continued detention of people who had agreed to leave the country. The pace of expulsions began to pick up in March, culminating in the group deportation of 26 Pakistani detainees on a chartered aircraft on June 26. They were among 131 Pakistanis who flew home together after being gathered from detention centers around the country. In addition to the Sept. 11 detainees, the passengers included 70 people who had ignored previous deportation orders and 35 who had been charged with crimes. The immigration service routinely organizes special flights, usually once or twice a week, when large numbers of people from the same country are being deported, said Karen Kraushauer, a spokeswoman for the I.N.S. Other expulsions of the Sept. 11 detainees have been so abrupt that family members did not know for days after the fact. In the case of Ali Yaghi, a Jordanian detainee who had applied for residency, his American wife and three children in Albany were never told that he was deported to Jordan on June 24, after spending nearly nine months in the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn on an immigration charge. Mr. Yaghi has not been heard from since, raising fears in his family that Jordan's security services may have been so suspicious about his long detention that they arrested him upon arrival.

The administration, in response to a lawsuit filed in State Supreme Court in Manhattan by The New York Times seeking numerous records concerning the terrorist attack on the World Trade Center, has cited a variety of reasons for keeping the records secret. In court papers and interviews, administration officials and city lawyers have argued that a federal court order in Virginia has barred them from releasing much of the material, citing its value in the government's case against Zacarias Moussaoui, who is accused of being the ''20th hijacker.'' But lawyers for the administration argued that even if the order, issued by the judge overseeing the prosecution of Mr. Moussaoui, were amended or lifted, they would still have no intention of releasing audiotapes of the Fire Department dispatchers, hundreds of individual accounts of firefighters or transcripts of radio communications from that day. The administration has argued that releasing these materials would be an invasion of privacy for the families of those who died at the trade center, and for the firefighters who responded to the disaster scene. The administration has said that that because the requested information involves ''interagency'' communication, it is exempt under the state Freedom of Information Law. ''The records requested by The Times were compiled for law enforcement purposes,'' according to legal documents filed by Michael A. Cardozo, the city's corporation counsel. He added: ''Second, both the oral histories and the radio transmissions, especially the 911 calls, contain highly personal and emotionally charged material. Victims were recorded as they were experiencing life-threatening circumstances, in some instances as they were dying.'' Shortly after he was appointed, Mr. Cardozo said that the administration planned to be much more responsive to media requests for documents and records than former Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani's had", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:020723nytimes.txt:0:b7ab6d5c432a", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 7057, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "020723nytimes.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "020723nytimes", "chunk_index": 1, "text": "legal documents filed by Michael A.

Shortly after he was appointed, Mr. Cardozo said that the administration planned to be much more responsive to media requests for documents and records than former Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani's had been. In its suit, which was filed in May, The Times rejects each of the city's claims, arguing that much of the material -- some of which has already been provided to reporters by family members and other sources -- reflects information and images that have been viewed by millions of people through news accounts, documentaries and books about Sept. 11. The Times argues that the Moussaoui order binds only the prosecution and defense, not state and local agencies. The newspaper also argues that Mr. Moussaoui's prosecution would not be compromised with the release of this information, and that the interagency argument is also invalid. ''Information about the case permeates the country,'' wrote David E. McCraw, a lawyer for The Times, in a response to the city's memorandum of law. Mr. McCraw added in an interview yesterday: ''The disclosures would not interfere with law enforcement, they do not reveal intimate personal details that someone should reasonably think should be secret, or constitute formal advice. These are documents that have huge historical and policy value for the city as a whole. They are the accounts of exactly how that operation worked from the ground level. That is precisely the kind of thing F.O.I.L. is designed to make public.'' Included in the material that the administration says should never become public are the oral histories given to Fire Department officials by scores of firefighters and chiefs after Sept. 11. Administration officials say that the firefighters and chiefs were promised confidentiality when they gave their accounts, and that to release them would violate that promise and reveal everything from opinions about the city's emergency response to gruesome details of death and damage. The Times, in its court filings, says the department has failed to prove that any promise of confidentiality was made to firefighters, and that senior Fire Department officials were compiling the accounts to create a historical record. Last December, in an interview with a reporter about the oral histories, Assistant Chief Salvatore J. Cassano, then the Fire Department's chief of fire operations, said: ''What we are trying to do is capture the events of the day through the eyes of the firefighters who were at the scene. It's for historical purposes.'' A former senior official in the Fire Department said yesterday that the firefighters were, in fact, never told that their remarks would be kept confidential.

''The histories are more than for historical purposes,'' said the former official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. ''They are of great value to understanding what happened there. I tend to think that people should be able to see them.'' The Times obtained roughly 70 of these histories independently, and posted over two dozen of them on its Web site. The histories offer specific and informed insights on what happened that day, candid assessments of both the successes and the many problems that plagued the rescue effort, and insights into how a future attack would be handled. Mr. Cardozo said of the oral histories: ''The fact that they were not intended for law enforcement purposes'' does not negate the fact that ''they are being used for law enforcement now. This is the principal issue.'' For its part, the Police Department initially released some records and materials related to Sept. 11, including tapes of its radio transmissions that day and a map pinpointing the last known locations of officers who died. The records were all released on request, without news agencies being asked to submit applications under the state's freedom of information statute. The Police Department denied a request to review phone calls received by 911 operators that day, citing a section of the law that exempts from disclosure records that were compiled for law enforcement purposes. As the Moussaoui trial drew closer, police officials cited the concerns of the federal prosecutors in denying access to additional materials. If federal prosecutors were to drop their objection to the disclosure, the department would decide case by case what materials it would be appropriate to make public, said a police spokesman, Michael O'Looney.

At about the same time, Don C. Wiley mysteriously disappeared. His car, a white rented Mitsubishi Galant, was abandoned on a bridge outside of Memphis, where he had just had a jovial dinner with friends. The following week, Vladimir Pasechnik collapsed in London, apparently of a stroke. The list would grow to nearly a dozen in the space of four nerve-jangling months. Stabbed in Leesburg, Va. Suffocated in an air-locked lab in Geelong, Australia. Found wedged under a chair, naked from the waist down, in a blood-splattered apartment in Norwich, England. Hit by a car while jogging. Killed in a private plane crash. Shot dead while a pizza delivery man served as a decoy. What joined these men was their proximity to the world of bioterror and germ warfare. Que, the one who was car-jacked, was a researcher at the University of Miami School of Medicine. Wiley, the most famous, knew as much as anyone about how the immune system responds to attacks from viruses like Ebola. Pasechnik was Russian, and before he defected, he helped the Soviets transform cruise missiles into biological weapons. The chain of deaths -- these three men and eight others like them -- began last fall, back when emergency teams in moonsuits were scouring the Capitol, when postal workers were dying, when news agencies were on high alert and the entire nation was afraid to open its mail. In more ordinary times, this cluster of deaths might not have been noticed, but these are not ordinary times. Neighbors report neighbors to the F.B.I.; passengers are escorted off planes because they make other passengers nervous; medical journals debate what to publish, for fear the articles will be read by evil eyes.

Neighbors report neighbors to the F.B.I.; passengers are escorted off planes because they make other passengers nervous; medical journals debate what to publish, for fear the articles will be read by evil eyes. Now we are spooked and startled by stories like these -- all these scientists dying within months of one another, at the precise moment when tiny organisms loom as a gargantuan threat. The stories of these dozen or so deaths started out as a curiosity and were transformed rumor by rumor into the specter of conspiracy as they circulated first on the Internet and then in the mainstream media. What are the odds, after all? What are the odds, indeed? For this is not about conspiracy but about coincidence -- unexpected connections that are both riveting and rattling. Much religious faith is based on the idea that almost nothing is coincidence; science is an exercise in eliminating the taint of coincidence; police work is often a feint and parry between those trying to prove coincidence and those trying to prove complicity. Without coincidence, there would be few movies worth watching (''Of all the gin joints in all the towns in all the world, she walks into mine''), and literary plots would come grinding to a disappointing halt. (What if Oedipus had not happened to marry his mother? If Javert had not happened to arrive in the town where Valjean was mayor?) The true meaning of the word is ''a surprising concurrence of events, perceived as meaningfully related, with no apparent causal connection.'' In other words, pure happenstance. Yet by merely noticing a coincidence, we elevate it to something that transcends its definition as pure chance. We are discomforted by the idea of a random universe. Like Mel Gibson's character Graham Hess in M. Night Shyamalan's new movie ''Signs,'' we want to feel that our lives are governed by a grand plan. The need is especially strong in an age when paranoia runs rampant. ''Coincidence feels like a loss of control perhaps,'' says John Allen Paulos, a professor of mathematics at Temple University and the author of ''Innumeracy,'' the improbable best seller about how Americans don't understand numbers. Finding a reason or a pattern where none actually exists ''makes it less frightening,'' he says, because events get placed in the realm of the logical. ''Believing in fate, or even conspiracy, can sometimes be more comforting than facing the fact that sometimes things just happen.'' In the past year there has been plenty of conspiracy, of course, but also a lot of things have ''just happened.'' And while our leaders are out there warning us to be vigilant, the statisticians are out there warning that patterns", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:020811nytimes.txt:1:449d3b380185", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 7062, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "020811nytimes.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "020811nytimes", "chunk_index": 2, "text": "none actually exists ''makes it less frightening,'' he says, because events get placed in the realm of the logical.

In the past year there has been plenty of conspiracy, of course, but also a lot of things have ''just happened.'' And while our leaders are out there warning us to be vigilant, the statisticians are out there warning that patterns are not always what they seem. We need to be reminded, Paulos and others say, that most of the time patterns that seem stunning to us aren't even there. For instance, although the numbers 9/11 (9 plus 1 plus 1) equal 11, and American Airlines Flight 11 was the first to hit the twin towers, and there were 92 people on board (9 plus 2), and Sept. 11 is the 254th day of the year (2 plus 5 plus 4), and there are 11 letters each in ''Afghanistan,'' ''New York City'' and ''the Pentagon'' (and while we're counting, in George W. Bush), and the World Trade towers themselves took the form of the number 11, this seeming numerical message is not actually a pattern that exists but merely a pattern we have found. (After all, the second flight to hit the towers was United Airlines Flight 175, and the one that hit the Pentagon was American Airlines Flight 77, and the one that crashed in a Pennsylvania field was United Flight 93, and the Pentagon is shaped, well, like a pentagon.) The same goes for the way we think of miraculous intervention. We need to be told that those lucky last-minute stops for an Egg McMuffin at McDonald's or to pick up a watch at the repair shop or to vote in the mayoral primary -- stops that saved lives of people who would otherwise have been in the towers when the first plane hit -- certainly looked like miracles but could have been predicted by statistics. So, too, can the most breathtaking of happenings -- like the sparrow that happened to appear at one memorial service just as a teenage boy, at the lectern eulogizing his mom, said the word ''mother.'' The tiny bird lighted on the boy's head; then he took it in his hand and set it free. Something like that has to be more than coincidence, we protest. What are the odds? The mathematician will answer that even in the most unbelievable situations, the odds are actually very good. The law of large numbers says that with a large enough denominator -- in other words, in a big wide world -- stuff will happen, even very weird stuff. ''The really unusual day would be one where nothing unusual happens,'' explains Persi Diaconis, a Stanford statistician who has spent his career collecting and studying examples of coincidence.", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:020811nytimes.txt:2:7f699f37549b", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 7063, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "020811nytimes.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "020811nytimes", "chunk_index": 3, "text": "we protest.

''The really unusual day would be one where nothing unusual happens,'' explains Persi Diaconis, a Stanford statistician who has spent his career collecting and studying examples of coincidence. Given that there are 280 million people in the United States, he says, ''280 times a day, a one-in-a-million shot is going to occur.'' Throw your best story at him -- the one about running into your childhood playmate on a street corner in Azerbaijan or marrying a woman who has a birthmark shaped like a shooting star that is a perfect match for your own or dreaming that your great-aunt Lucy would break her collarbone hours before she actually does -- and he will nod politely and answer that such things happen all the time. In fact, he and his colleagues also warn me that although I pulled all examples in the prior sentence from thin air, I will probably get letters from readers saying one of those things actually happened to them. And what of the deaths of nearly a dozen scientists? Is it really possible that they all just happened to die, most in such peculiar, jarring ways, within so short a time? ''We can never say for a fact that something isn't a conspiracy,'' says Bradley Efron, a professor of statistics at Stanford. ''We can just point out the odds that it isn't.'' I first found myself wondering about coincidence last spring when I read a small news item out of the tiny Finnish town of Raahe, which is 370 miles north of Helsinki. On the morning of March 5, two elderly twin brothers were riding their bicycles, as was their habit, completing their separate errands. At 9:30, one brother was struck by a truck along coastal Highway 8 and killed instantly. About two hours later and one mile down the same highway, the other brother was struck by a second truck and killed. ''It was hard to believe this could happen just by chance,'' says Marko Salo, the senior constable who investigated both deaths for the Raahe Police Department. Instead, the department looked for a cause, thinking initially that the second death was really a suicide. ''Almost all Raahe thought he did it knowing that his brother was dead,'' Salo says of the second brother's death. ''They thought he tried on purpose. That would have explained things.'' But the investigation showed that the older brother was off cheerfully getting his hair cut just before his own death. The family could not immediately accept that this was random coincidence, either. ''It was their destiny,'' offers their", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:020811nytimes.txt:3:b2a53496a261", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 7064, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "020811nytimes.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "020811nytimes", "chunk_index": 4, "text": "cause, thinking initially that the second death was really a suicide.

But the investigation showed that the older brother was off cheerfully getting his hair cut just before his own death. The family could not immediately accept that this was random coincidence, either. ''It was their destiny,'' offers their nephew, who spoke with me on behalf of the family. It is his opinion that his uncles shared a psychic bond throughout their lives. When one brother became ill, the other one fell ill shortly thereafter. When one reached to scratch his nose, the other would often do the same. Several years ago, one brother was hit and injured by a car (also while biking), and the other one developed pain in the same leg. The men's sister had still another theory entirely. ''She worried that it was a plot to kill both of them,'' the nephew says, describing his aunt's concerns that terrorists might have made their way to Raahe. ''She was angry. She wanted to blame someone. So she said the chances of this happening by accident are impossible.'' Not true, the statisticians say. But before we can see the likelihood for what it is, we have to eliminate the distracting details. We are far too taken, Efron says, with superfluous facts and findings that have no bearing on the statistics of coincidence. After our initial surprise, Efron says that the real yardstick for measuring probability is ''How surprised should we be?'' How surprising is it, to use this example, that two 70-year-old men in the same town should die within two hours of each other? Certainly not common, but not unimaginable. But the fact that they were brothers would seem to make the odds more astronomical. This, however, is a superfluous fact. What is significant in their case is that two older men were riding bicycles along a busy highway in a snowstorm, which greatly increases the probability that they would be hit by trucks. Statisticians like Efron emphasize that when something striking happens, it only incidentally happens to us. When the numbers are large enough, and the distracting details are removed, the chance of anything is fairly high. Imagine a meadow, he says, and then imagine placing your finger on a blade of grass. The chance of choosing exactly that blade of grass would be one in a million or even higher, but because it is a certainty that you will choose a blade of grass, the odds of one particular one being chosen are no more or less than the one to either side.

Tibshirani, a statistician at Stanford University who proved that it was probably not coincidence that accident rates increase when", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:020811nytimes.txt:4:3e41b283b03e", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 7065, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "020811nytimes.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "020811nytimes", "chunk_index": 5, "text": "placing your finger on a blade of grass. The chance of choosing exactly that blade of grass would be one in a million or even higher, but because it is a certainty that you will choose a blade of grass, the odds of one particular one being chosen are no more or less than the one to either side. Robert J. Tibshirani, a statistician at Stanford University who proved that it was probably not coincidence that accident rates increase when people simultaneously drive and talk on a cellphone, leading some states to ban the practice, uses the example of a hand of poker. ''The chance of getting a royal flush is very low,'' he says, ''and if you were to get a royal flush, you would be surprised. But the chance of any hand in poker is low. You just don't notice when you get all the others; you notice when you get the royal flush.'' When these professors talk, they do so slowly, aware that what they are saying is deeply counterintuitive. No sooner have they finished explaining that the world is huge and that any number of unlikely things are likely to happen than they shift gears and explain that the world is also quite small, which explains an entire other type of coincidence. One relatively simple example of this is ''the birthday problem.'' There are as many as 366 days in a year (accounting for leap years), and so you would have to assemble 367 people in a room to absolutely guarantee that two of them have the same birthday. But how many people would you need in that room to guarantee a 50 percent chance of at least one birthday match? Intuitively, you assume that the answer should be a relatively large number. And in fact, most people's first guess is 183, half of 366. But the actual answer is 23. In Paulos's book, he explains the math this way: ''[T]he number of ways in which five dates can be chosen (allowing for repetitions) is (365 x 365 x 365 x 365 x 365). Of all these 3655 ways, however, only (365 x 364 x 363 x 362 x 361) are such that no two of the dates are the same; any of the 365 days can be chosen first, any of the remaining 364 can be chosen second and so on. Thus, by dividing this latter product (365 x 364 x 363 x 362 x 361) by 3655, we get the probability that five persons chosen at random will have no birthday in common. Now, if we subtract this probability from 1 (or from 100 percent if we're dealing with percentages), we get the complementary probability that at least two of the five people do have a birthday in common. A similar calculation using 23 rather than 5 yields 1/2, or 50 percent, as the", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:020811nytimes.txt:5:b2acb465defe", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 7066, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "020811nytimes.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "020811nytimes", "chunk_index": 6, "text": "latter product (365 x 364 x 363 x 362 x 361) by 3655, we get the probability that five persons chosen at random will have no birthday in common.

A similar calculation using 23 rather than 5 yields 1/2, or 50 percent, as the probability that at least 2 of 23 people will have a common birthday.'' Got that? Using similar math, you can calculate that if you want even odds of finding two people born within one day of each other, you only need 14 people, and if you are looking for birthdays a week apart, the magic number is seven. (Incidentally, if you are looking for an even chance that someone in the room will have your exact birthday, you will need 253 people.) And yet despite numbers like these, we are constantly surprised when we meet a stranger with whom we share a birth date or a hometown or a middle name. We are amazed by the overlap -- and we conveniently ignore the countless things we do not have in common. which brings us to the death of Benito Que, who was not, despite reports to the contrary, actually a microbiologist. He was a researcher in a lab at the University of Miami Sylvester Cancer Center, where he was testing various agents as potential cancer drugs. He never worked with anthrax or any infectious disease, according to Dr. Bach Ardalan, a professor of medicine at the University of Miami and Que's boss for the past three years. ''There is no truth to the talk that Benito was doing anything related to microbiology,'' Ardalan says. ''He certainly wasn't doing any sensitive kind of work that anyone would want to hurt him for.'' But those facts got lost amid the confusion -- and the prevalence of very distracting details -- in the days after he died. So did the fact that he had hypertension. On the afternoon of Monday, Nov. 19, Que attended a late-afternoon lab meeting, and as it ended, he mentioned that he hadn't been feeling well. A nurse took Que's blood pressure, which was 190/110. ''I wanted to admit him'' to the hospital, Ardalan says, but Que insisted on going home. Que had the habit of parking his car on Northwest 10th Avenue, a side street that Ardalan describes as being ''beyond the area considered to be safe.'' His spot that day was in front of a house where a young boy was playing outside. Four youths approached Que as he neared his car, the boy later told the police, and there might have been some baseball bats involved. When the police arrived, they found Que unconscious.

His briefcase was at his side, but his wallet was gone. His car was eventually found abandoned several miles from the scene. He was taken to the hospital, the same one at which he worked, where he spent more than a week in a coma before dying without ever regaining consciousness. The mystery, limited to small items in local Florida papers at first, was ''What killed Benito Que?'' Could it have been the mugging? A CAT scan showed no signs of bony fracture. In fact, there were no scrapes or bruises or other physical signs of assault. Perhaps he died of a stroke? His brain scan did show a ''huge intracranial bleed,'' Ardalan says, which would have explained his earlier headache, and his high blood pressure would have made a stroke likely. In other words, this man just happened to be mugged when he was a stroke waiting to be triggered. That is a jarring coincidence, to be sure. But it is not one that the world was likely to have noticed if Don Wiley had not up and disappeared. Don C. Wiley was a microbiologist. He did some work with anthrax, and a lot of work with H.I.V., and he was also quite familiar with Ebola, smallpox, herpes and influenza. At 57, he was the father of four children and a professor of biochemistry and biophysics in the department of molecular and cellular biology at Harvard. On Nov. 15, four days before the attack on Benito Que, Wiley was in Memphis to visit his father and to attend the annual meeting of the scientific advisory board of St. Jude's Research Hospital, of which he was a member. At midnight, he was seen leaving a banquet at the Peabody Hotel in downtown Memphis. Friends and colleagues say he had a little to drink but did not appear impaired, and they remember him as being in a fine mood, looking forward to seeing his wife and children, who were about to join him for a short vacation. Wiley's father lives in a Memphis suburb, and that is where Wiley should have been headed after the banquet. Instead, his car was found facing in the opposite direction on the Hernando DeSoto Bridge, which spans the Mississippi River at the border of Tennessee and Arkansas. When the police found the car at 4 a.m., it was unlocked, the keys were in the ignition and the", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:020811nytimes.txt:7:c129d1deeb39", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 7068, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "020811nytimes.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "020811nytimes", "chunk_index": 8, "text": "his wife and children, who were about to join him for a short vacation.

When the police found the car at 4 a.m., it was unlocked, the keys were in the ignition and the gas tank was full. There was a scrape of yellow paint on the driver's side, which appeared to come from a construction sign on the bridge, and a right hubcap was missing on the passenger side, where the wheel rims were also scraped. There was no sign, however, of Don Wiley. The police trawled the muddy Mississippi, but they didn't really expect to find him. Currents run fast at that part of the river, and a body would be quickly swept away. At the start of the search, they thought he might have committed suicide; others had jumped from the DeSoto Bridge over the years. Detectives searched Wiley's financial records, his family relationships, his scientific research -- anything for a hint that the man might have had cause to take his own life. Finding nothing, the investigation turned medical. Wiley, they learned, had a seizure disorder that he had hidden from all but family and close friends. He had a history of two or three major episodes a year, his wife told investigators, and the condition was made worse when he was under stress or the influence of alcohol. Had Wiley, who could well have been tired, disoriented by bridge construction and under the influence of a few drinks, had a seizure that sent him over the side of the bridge? That was the theory the police spoke of in public, but they were also considering something else. The week that Wiley disappeared coincided with the peak of anthrax fear throughout the country. Tainted letters appeared the month before at the Senate and the House of Representatives. Two weeks earlier, a New York City hospital worker died of inhaled anthrax. Memphis was not untouched by the scare; a federal judge and two area congressmen each received hoax letters. Could it be mere chance that this particular scientist, who had profound knowledge of these microbes, had disappeared at this time? ''The circumstances were peculiar,'' says George Bolds, a spokesman for the Memphis bureau of the F.B.I., which was called in to assist. ''There were questions that had to be asked. Could he have been kidnapped because his scientific abilities would have made him capable of creating anthrax? Or maybe he'd had some involvement in the mailing of the anthrax, and he'd disappeared to cover his tracks? Did his co-conspirators grab him and kill him?

''We were in new territory,'' Bolds continued. ''Just because something is conceivable doesn't mean it's actually happened, but at the same time, just because it's never happened before doesn't mean it can't happen. People's ideas of what is possible definitely changed on Sept. 11. People feel less secure and less safe. I'm not sure that they're at greater risk than they were before. Maybe they're just more aware of the risk they are actually at.'' As a species, we appear to be biologically programmed to see patterns and conspiracies, and this tendency increases when we sense that we're in danger. ''We are hard-wired to overreact to coincidences,'' says Persi Diaconis. ''It goes back to primitive man. You look in the bush, it looks like stripes, you'd better get out of there before you determine the odds that you're looking at a tiger. The cost of being flattened by the tiger is high. Right now, people are noticing any kind of odd behavior and being nervous about it.'' Adds John Allen Paulos: ''Human beings are pattern-seeking animals. It might just be part of our biology that conspires to make coincidences more meaningful than they really are. Look at the natural world of rocks and plants and rivers: it doesn't offer much evidence for superfluous coincidences, but primitive man had to be alert to all anomalies and respond to them as if they were real.'' For decades, all academic talk of coincidence has been in the context of the mathematical. New work by scientists like Joshua B. Tenenbaum, an assistant professor in the department of brain and cognitive sciences at M.I.T., is bringing coincidence into the realm of human cognition. Finding connections is not only the way we react to the extraordinary, Tenenbaum postulates, but also the way we make sense of our ordinary world. ''Coincidences are a window into how we learn about things,'' he says. ''They show us how minds derive richly textured knowledge from limited situations.'' To put it another way, our reaction to coincidence shows how our brains fill in the factual blanks. In an optical illusion, he explains, our brain fills the gaps, and although people take it for granted that seeing is believing, optical illusions prove that's not true. ''Illusions also prove that our brain is capable of imposing structure on the world,'' he says. ''One of the things our brain is designed to do is infer the causal structure of the world", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:020811nytimes.txt:9:96ee499b1f51", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 7070, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "020811nytimes.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "020811nytimes", "chunk_index": 10, "text": "To put it another way, our reaction to coincidence shows how our brains fill in the factual blanks.

''One of the things our brain is designed to do is infer the causal structure of the world from limited information.'' If not for this ability, he says, a child could not learn to speak. A child sees a conspiracy, he says, in that others around him are obviously communicating and it is up to the child to decode the method. But these same mechanisms can misfire, he warns. They were well suited to a time of cavemen and tigers and can be overloaded in our highly complex world. ''It's why we have the urge to work everything into one big grand scheme,'' he says. ''We do like to weave things together. ''But have we evolved into fundamentally rational or fundamentally irrational creatures? That is one of the central questions.'' We pride ourselves on being independent and original, and yet our reactions to nearly everything can be plotted along a predictable spectrum. When the grid is coincidences, one end of the scale is for those who believe that these are entertaining events with no meaning; at the other end are those who believe that coincidence is never an accident. The view of coincidence as fate has lately become something of a minitrend in the New Age section of bookstores. Among the more popular authors is SQuire Rushnell (who, in the interest of marketing, spells his first name with a capital Q). Rushnell spent 20 years producing such television programs as ''Good Morning America'' and ''Schoolhouse Rock.'' His fascination with coincidence began when he learned that both John Adams and Thomas Jefferson died on the same July 4, 50 years after the ratification of the Declaration of Independence. ''That stuck in my craw,'' Rushnell says, ''and I couldn't stop wondering what that means.'' And so Rushnell wrote ''When God Winks: How the Power of Coincidence Guides Your Life.'' The book was published by a small press shortly before Sept. 11 and sold well without much publicity. It will be rereleased with great fanfare by Simon & Schuster next month. Its message, Rushnell says, is that ''coincidences are signposts along your universal pathway. They are hints that you are going in the right direction or that you should change course. It's like your grandmother sitting across the Thanksgiving table from you and giving you a wink. What does that wink mean? 'I'm here, I love you, stay the course.'''

What does that wink mean? 'I'm here, I love you, stay the course.''' During my interview with Rushnell, I told him the following story: On a frigid December night many years ago, a friend dragged me out of my warm apartment, where I planned to spend the evening in my bathrobe nursing a cold. I had to come with her to the movies, she said, because she had made plans with a pal from her office, and he was bringing a friend for me to meet. Translation: I was expected to show up for a last-minute blind date. For some reason, I agreed to go, knocking back a decongestant as I left home. We arrived at the theater to find that the friend who was supposed to be my ''date'' had canceled, but not to worry, another friend had been corralled as a replacement. The replacement and I both fell asleep in the movie (I was sedated by cold medicine; he was a medical resident who had been awake for 36 hours), but four months later we were engaged, and we have been married for nearly 15 years. Rushnell was enthralled by this tale, particularly by the mystical force that seemed to have nudged me out the door when I really wanted to stay home and watch ''The Golden Girls.'' I know that those on the other end of the spectrum -- the scientists and mathematicians -- would have offered several overlapping explanations of why it was unremarkable. There are, of course, the laws of big numbers and small numbers -- the fact that the world is simultaneously so large that anything can happen and so small that weird things seem to happen all the time. Add to that the work of the late Amos Tversky, a giant in the field of coincidence theory, who once described his role in this world as ''debugging human intuition.'' Among other things, Tversky disproved the ''hot hand'' theory of basketball, the belief that a player who has made his last few baskets will more likely than not make his next. After examining thousands of shots by the Philadelphia 76ers, he proved that the odds of a successful shot cannot be predicted by the shots that came before. Tversky similarly proved that arthritis sufferers cannot actually predict the weather and are not in more pain when there's a storm brewing, a belief that began with the ancient Greeks. He followed 18 patients for 15 months, keeping detailed records of their reports of pain and joint swelling and matching them with constantly updated weather reports. There was no pattern,", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:020811nytimes.txt:11:e2dcb2f23a23", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 7072, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "020811nytimes.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "020811nytimes", "chunk_index": 12, "text": "Philadelphia 76ers, he proved that the odds of a successful shot cannot be predicted by the shots that came before.

He followed 18 patients for 15 months, keeping detailed records of their reports of pain and joint swelling and matching them with constantly updated weather reports. There was no pattern, he concluded, though he also conceded that his data would not change many people's beliefs. We believe in such things as hot hands and arthritic forecasting and predestined blind dates because we notice only the winning streaks, only the chance meetings that lead to romance, only the days that Grandma's hands ache before it rains. ''We forget all the times that nothing happens,'' says Ruma Falk, a professor emeritus of psychology at the Hebrew University in Jerusalem, who studied years ago with Tversky. ''Dreams are another example,'' Falk says. ''We dream a lot. Every night and every morning. But it sometimes happens that the next day something reminds you of that dream. Then you think it was a premonition.'' Falk's work is focused on the question of why we are so entranced by coincidence in the first place. Her research itself began with a coincidence. She was on sabbatical in New York from her native Israel, and on the night before Rosh Hashana she happened to meet a friend from Jerusalem on a Manhattan street corner. She and the friend stood on that corner and marveled at the coincidence. What is the probability of this happening? she remembers wondering. What did this mean? ''How stupid we were,'' Falk says now, ''to be so surprised. We related to all the details that had converged to create that moment. But the real question was what was the probability that at some time in some place I would meet one of my circle of friends? And when I told this story to others at work, they encoded the events as two Israelis meeting in New York, something that happens all the time.'' Why was her experience so resonant for her, Falk asked herself, but not for those around her? One of the many experiments she has conducted since then proceeded as follows: she visited several large university classes, with a total of 200 students, and asked each student to write his or her birth date on a card. She then quietly sorted the cards and found the handful of birthdays that students had in common. Falk wrote those dates on the blackboard. April 10, for instance, Nov. 8, Dec. 16. She then handed out a second card and asked all the students to use a scale to rate how surprised they were by these coincidences. The cards were numbered, so Falk could determine", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:020811nytimes.txt:12:dd11e55b7518", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 7073, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "020811nytimes.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "020811nytimes", "chunk_index": 13, "text": "students, and asked each student to write his or her birth date on a card.

She then handed out a second card and asked all the students to use a scale to rate how surprised they were by these coincidences. The cards were numbered, so Falk could determine which answers came from respondents who found their own birth date written on the board. Those in that subgroup were consistently more surprised by the coincidence than the rest of the students. ''It shows the stupid power of personal involvement,'' Falk says. The more personal the event, the more meaning we give it, which is why I am quite taken with my story of meeting my husband (because it is a pivotal moment in my life), and why SQuire Rushnell is also taken with it (because it fits into the theme of his book), but also why Falk is not impressed at all. She likes her own story of the chance meeting on a corner better than my story, while I think her story is a yawn. The fact that personal attachment adds significance to an event is the reason we tend to react so strongly to the coincidences surrounding Sept. 11. In a deep and lasting way, that tragedy feels as if it happened to us all. Falk's findings also shed light on the countless times that pockets of the general public find themselves at odds with authorities and statisticians. Her results might explain, for instance, why lupus patients are certain their breast implants are the reason for their illness, despite the fact that epidemiologists conclude there is no link, or why parents of autistic children are resolute in their belief that childhood immunizations or environmental toxins or a host of other suspected pathogens are the cause, even though experts are skeptical. They might also explain the outrage of all the patients who are certain they live in a cancer cluster, but who have been told otherwise by researchers. Let's be clear: this does not mean that conspiracies do not sometimes exist or that the environment never causes clusters of death. And just as statistics are often used to show us that we should not be surprised, they can also prove what we suspect, that something is wrong out there. ''The fact that so many suspected cancer clusters have turned out to be statistically insupportable does not mean the energy we spent looking for them has been wasted,'' says Dr. James M. Robins, a professor of epidemiology and biostatistics at Harvard and an expert on cancer clusters. ''You're never going to find the real ones if you don't look at all the ones that don't turn out to be", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:020811nytimes.txt:13:5f83649e2efd", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 7074, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "020811nytimes.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "020811nytimes", "chunk_index": 14, "text": "also prove what we suspect, that something is wrong out there.

''You're never going to find the real ones if you don't look at all the ones that don't turn out to be real ones.'' Most often, though, coincidence is a sort of Rorschach test. We look into it and find what we already believe. ''It's like an archer shooting an arrow and then drawing a circle around it,'' Falk says. ''We give it meaning because it does mean something -- to us.'' Vladimir Pasechnik was 64 when he died. His early career was spent in the Soviet Union working at Biopreparat, the site of that country's biological weapons program. He defected in 1989 and spilled what he knew to the British, revealing for the first time the immense scale of Soviet work with anthrax, plague, tularemia and smallpox. For the next 10 years, he worked at the Center for Applied Microbiology and Research, part of Britain's Department of Health. Two years ago, he left to form Regma Biotechnologies, whose goal was to develop treatment for tuberculosis and other infectious disease. In the weeks before he died, Pasechnik had reportedly consulted with authorities about the growing anthrax scare. Despite all these intriguing details, there is nothing to suggest that his death was caused by anything other than a stroke. Robert Schwartz's death, while far more dramatic and bizarre, also appears to have nothing to do with the fact that he was an expert on DNA sequencing and analysis. On Dec. 10 he was found dead on the kitchen floor of his isolated log-and-fieldstone farmhouse near Leesburg, Va., where he had lived alone since losing his wife to cancer four years ago and his children to college. Schwartz had been stabbed to death with a two-foot-long sword, and his killer had carved an X on the back of his neck. Three friends of Schwartz's college-age daughter were soon arrested for what the prosecutor called a ''planned assassination''; two of the trials for first-degree murder are scheduled for this month. A few weeks later, police arrested the daughter as well. One suspect has a history of mental illness, and their written statements to police talk of devil worship and revenge. There is no talk, however, of microbiology. On the same day that Schwartz died, Set Van Nguyen, 44, was found dead in an air-locked storage chamber at the Australian Commonwealth's Scientific and Industrial Research Organization's animal diseases facility in Geelong. A months-long internal investigation concluded that a string of equipment failures had allowed nitrogen to build up in the room, causing Nguyen to suffocate.

A months-long internal investigation concluded that a string of equipment failures had allowed nitrogen to build up in the room, causing Nguyen to suffocate. Although the center itself dealt with microbes like mousepox, which is similar to smallpox, Nguyen himself did not. ''Nguyen was in no way involved in research into mousepox,'' says Stephen Prowse, who was the acting director of the Australian lab during the investigation. ''He was a valued member of the laboratory's technical support staff and not a research scientist.'' Word of all these deaths (though not the specific details) found its way to Ian Gurney, a British writer. Gurney is the author of ''The Cassandra Prophecy: Armageddon Approaches,'' a book that uses clues from the Bible to calculate that Judgment Day will occur in or about the year 2023. He is currently researching his second book, which is in part about the threat of nuclear and biological weapons, and after Sept. 11 he entered a news alert request into Yahoo, asking to be notified whenever there was news with the key word ''microbiologist.'' First Que, then Wiley, then Pasechnik, Schwartz and Nguyen popped up on Gurney's computer. ''I'm not a conspiracy theorist,'' says the man who has predicted the end of the world, ''but it certainly did look suspicious.'' Gurney compiled what he had learned from these scattered accounts into an article that he sent to a number of Web sites, including Rense.com, which tracks U.F.O. sightings worldwide. ''Over the past few weeks,'' Gurney wrote, ''several world-acclaimed scientific researchers specializing in infectious diseases and biological agents such as anthrax, as well as DNA sequencing, have been found dead or have gone missing.'' The article went on to call Benito Que, the cancer lab technician, ''a cell biologist working on infectious diseases like H.I.V.,'' and said that he had been attacked by four men with a baseball bat but did not mention that he suffered from high blood pressure. It then described the disappearance of Wiley without mentioning his seizure disorder and the death of Pasechnik without saying that he had suffered a stroke. It gave the grisly details of Schwartz's murder, but said nothing of the arrests of his daughter's friends. Nguyen, in turn, was described as ''a skilled microbiologist,'' and it was noted that he shared a last name with Kathy Nguyen, the 61-year-old hospital worker who just happened to be the one New Yorker to die of anthrax. Of course, there have always been rumors based on skewed historical fact.

Of course, there have always been rumors based on skewed historical fact. Recall, for example, the list of coincidences that supposedly linked the deaths of Presidents Lincoln and Kennedy. It goes, in part, like this: The two men were elected 100 years apart; their assassins were born 100 years apart (in fact, 101 years apart); they were both succeeded by men named Johnson; and the two Johnsons were born 100 years apart. Their names each contain seven letters; their successors' names each contain 13 letters; and their assassins' names each contain 15 letters. Lincoln was shot in a theater and his assassin ran to a warehouse, while Kennedy was shot from a warehouse and his assassin ran to a theater. Lincoln, or so the story goes, had a secretary named Kennedy who warned him not to go to the theater the night he was killed (for the record, Lincoln's White House secretaries were named John Nicolay and John Hay, and Lincoln regularly rejected warnings not to attend public events out of fear for his safety, including his own inauguration); Kennedy, in turn, had a secretary named Lincoln (true, Evelyn Lincoln) who warned him not to go to Dallas (he, too, was regularly warned not to go places, including San Antonio the day before his trip to Dallas). I first read about these connections five years after the Kennedy assassination, when I was 8, which says something about how conspiracy theory speaks to the child in all of us. But it also says something about the technology of the time. The numerological coincidences from the World Trade Center that I mentioned at the start of this article made their way onto my computer screen by Sept. 15, from a friend of a friend of a friend of an acquaintance, ad infinitum and ad nauseam. Professor Robins of Harvard points out that ''the Web has changed the scale of these things.'' Had there been a string of dead scientists back in 1992 rather than 2002, he says, it is possible that no one would have ever known. ''Back then, you would not have had the technical ability to gather all these bits and pieces of information, while today you'd be able to pull it off. It's well known that if you take a lot of random noise, you can find chance patterns in it, and the Net makes it easier to collect random noise.''

The Gurney article traveled from one Web site to the next and caught the attention of Paul Sieveking, a co-editor of Fortean Times, a magazine that describes itself as ''the Journal of Strange Phenomena.'' ''People send me stuff all the time,'' Sieveking says. ''This was really interesting.'' Wearing his second hat as a columnist for the The Sunday Telegraph in London, he wrote a column on the subject for that paper titled ''Strange but True -- The Deadly Curse of the Bioresearchers.'' His version began with the link between the two Nguyens and concluded, ''It is possible that nothing connects this string of events, but . . . it offers ample fodder for the conspiracy theorist or thriller writer.'' Commenting on the story months later, Sieveking says: ''It's probably just a random clumping, but it just happens to look significant. We're all natural storytellers, and conspiracy theorists are just frustrated novelists. We like to make up a good story out of random facts.'' Over the months, Gurney added names to his list and continued to send it to virtual and actual publications around the U.S. Mainstream newspapers started taking up the story, including an alternative weekly in Memphis, where interest in the Wiley case was particularly strong, and most recently The Toronto Globe and Mail. The tally of ''microbiologists'' is now at 11, give or take, depending on the story you read. In addition to the men already discussed, the names that appear most often are these: Victor Korshunov, a Russian expert in intestinal bacteria, who was bashed over the head near his home in Moscow; Ian Langford, a British expert in environmental risk and disease, who was found dead in his home near Norwich, England, naked from the waist down and wedged under a chair; Tanya Holzmayer, who worked as a microbiologist near San Jose and was shot seven times by a former colleague when she opened the door to a pizza delivery man; David Wynn-Williams, who studied microbes in the Antarctic and was hit by a car while jogging near his home in Cambridge, England; and Steven Mostow, an expert in influenza, who died when the plane he was piloting crashed near Denver. The stories have also made their way into the e-mail in-boxes of countless microbiologists.

Janet Shoemaker, director of public and scientific affairs for the American Society for Microbiology, heard the tales and points out that her organization alone has 41,000 members, meaning that the deaths of 11 worldwide, most of whom were not technically microbiologists at all, is not statistically surprising. ''We're saddened by anyone's death,'' she says. ''But this is just a coincidence. In another political climate I don't think anyone would have noticed.'' Ken Alibek heard them, too, and dismissed them. Alibek is one of the country's best-known microbiologists. He was the No. 2 man at Biopreparrat (where Victor Pasechnik also worked) before he defected and now works with the U.S. government seeking antidotes for the very weapons he developed. Those who have died, he says, did not really know anything about biological weapons, and if there were a conspiracy to kill scientists with such knowledge, he would be dead. ''I considered all this a little artificial, because a number of them couldn't have been considered B.W. experts,'' he says with a hint of disdain. ''I got an e-mail from Pasechnik before he died, and he was working on a field completely different from this. People say to me, 'Ken, you could be a target,' but if you start thinking about this, then your life is over. I'm not saying I'm not worried, but I'm not paying much attention. I'm opening my mail as usual. If I see something suspicious, I know what to do.'' Others are not quite as sanguine. Phyllis Della-Latta is the director of clinical microbiology services at New York's Columbia Presbyterian Medical Center. She found an article on the deaths circulating in the most erudite place -- an Internet discussion group of directors of clinical microbiology labs around the world. These are the people who, when a patient develops suspicious symptoms, are brought in to rule out things like anthrax. Della-Latta, whom I know from past medical reporting, forwarded the article to me with a note: ''See attached. FYI. Should I be concerned??? I'm off on a business trip to Italy tomorrow & next week. If I don't return, write my obituary.'' She now says she doesn't really believe there is any connection between the deaths. ''It's probably only coincidence,'' she says, then adds: ''But if we traced back a lot of things that we once dismissed as coincidence -- foreigners taking flying lessons -- we would have found they weren't coincidence at all. You become paranoid. You have to be.'' Don Wiley's body was finally found on Dec. 20, near Vidalia, La., about 300 miles south of where he disappeared. The Memphis medical examiner, O.C. Smith, concluded", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:020811nytimes.txt:18:545ae391a61a", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 7079, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "020811nytimes.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "020811nytimes", "chunk_index": 19, "text": "believe there is any connection between the deaths. ''It's probably only coincidence,'' she says, then adds: ''But if we traced back a lot of things that we once dismissed as coincidence -- foreigners taking flying lessons -- we would have found they weren't coincidence at all. You become paranoid. You have to be.'' Don Wiley's body was finally found on Dec. 20, near Vidalia, La., about 300 miles south of where he disappeared. The Memphis medical examiner, O.C. Smith, concluded that yellow paint marks on Wiley's car suggest that he hit a construction sign on the Hernando DeSoto Bridge, as does the fact that a hubcap was missing from the right front tire. Smith's theory is that heavy truck traffic on the bridge can set off wind gusts and create ''roadway bounce,'' which might have been enough to cause Wiley to lose his balance after getting out of the car to inspect the scrapes. He was 6-foot-3, and the bridge railing would have only come up to mid-thigh. ''If Dr. Wiley were on the curb trying to assess damage to his car, all of these factors may have played a role in his going over the rail,'' Smith said when he issued his report. Bone fractures found on the body support this theory. Wiley suffered fractures to his neck and spine, and his chest was crushed, injuries that are consistent with Wiley's hitting a support beam before he landed in the water. The Wiley family considers this case closed. ''These kinds of theories are something that's always there,'' says Wiley's wife, Katrin Valgeirsdottir, who has heard all the rumors. ''People who want to believe it will believe it, and there's nothing anyone can say.'' The Memphis Police also consider the case closed, and the local office of the F.B.I. has turned its attention to other odd happenings. The talk of Memphis at the moment is the bizarre ambush of the city's coroner last month. He was wrapped in barbed wire and left lying in a stairwell of the medical examiner's building with a live bomb strapped to his chest. Coincidentally, that coroner, O.C. Smith, was also the coroner who did the much-awaited, somewhat controversial autopsy on Don Wiley. What are the odds of that?

(AP) _ The Federal Aviation Administration has stayed in closer contact with the military since Sept. 11 to ensure that fighter jets take off quickly to chase hostile or suspicious aircraft. On Sept. 11, flight controllers suspected around 8:25 a.m. EDT that American Airlines Flight 11 from Boston's Logan Airport had been hijacked, but the North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD) wasn't notified until 8:40 a.m. _ six minutes before the plane struck the World Trade Center. Today, NORAD would know instantly of a suspected hijacking. \"NORAD is now linked up telephonically 24 hours a day, seven days a week, so anything that's an anomaly or a suspected anomaly that's found in the system, NORAD knows about it as quickly as we do,\" said David Canoles, FAA's manager of air traffic evaluations and investigations. At a NORAD operations center in Cheyenne Mountain in Colorado Springs, Colo., a noncommissioned officer listens to conversations on the FAA network from all over the United States, said Maj. Douglas Martin, NORAD spokesman. \"If he hears anything that indicates difficulty in the skies, we begin the staff work to scramble,\" Martin said. Before Sept. 11, the FAA had to telephone NORAD about any possible hijackings. **From Sept. 11 to June, NORAD scrambled jets or diverted combat air patrols 462 times, almost seven times as often as the 67 scrambles from September 2000 to June 2001, Martin said. ** In June, Air Force jets scrambled three times to intercept small private planes that had wandered into restricted airspace around the White House and around Camp David, the presidential retreat. Jet fighters approaching a suspicious plane might radio the pilot, tip their wings or simply identify the aircraft and break off, Martin said. No one has been shot out of the sky since Sept. 11, he said; for that, an order must come from President Bush or Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld.

FAA officials held news conferences Monday in Boston, New York and Washington, giving chronological accounts of the terrorist attacks and how they forced an unprecedented shutdown of the U.S. skies. Air traffic controllers didn't notice anything odd Sept. 11 until communications fell silent with Flight 11's pilot 25 minutes after the plane took off at 8 a.m. \"We considered it at that time to be a possible hijacking,\" air traffic manager Glenn Michael said. The FAA notified NORAD 15 minutes later; three minutes after that, NORAD was told United Airlines Flight 175 had been hijacked. The first two military interceptors, Air Force F-15 Eagles from Otis Air Force Base in Massachusetts, scrambled airborne at 8:52 a.m., too late to do anything about the second jet heading for the Trade Center or a third heading toward the Pentagon. Mike McCormick, air traffic control manager at the New York Center _ the main control center for the area _ made the unprecedented decision at 9:04 a.m. to declare \"ATC Zero,\" meaning that normal services were suspended and the hundreds of aircraft over New York and the western Atlantic were to immediately divert to an airport and land as soon as possible. He made the decision because the second plane, United Flight 175, was flying south down the Hudson toward New York. McCormick said the Boeing 757's transponder was working and he knew where it was headed, even before the Newark Airport Control Tower picked it up visually as it turned and headed back toward the twin towers. At 9:45 a.m., after the World Trade Center and the Pentagon had been struck by the hijacked planes, the FAA ordered all of the more than 4,000 aircraft in the skies over the United States to land at the nearest airport. __ On the Net: Federal Aviation Administration: [http://www.faa.gov/](http://www.faa.gov/) North American Aerospace Defense Command: [http://www.norad.mil/](http://www.norad.mil/) Keywords: U.S. Domestic © The Associated Press LESLIE MILLER; Associated Press Writer Military now notified immediately of unusual air traffic events,08-12-2002 FAIR USE NOTICE: This site contains copyrighted material the use of which has not always been specifically authorized by the copyright owner.

The blueprint, uncovered by the Sunday Herald, for the creation of a 'global Pax Americana' was drawn up for Dick Cheney (now vice- president), Donald Rumsfeld (defence secretary), Paul Wolfowitz (Rumsfeld's deputy), George W Bush's younger brother Jeb and Lewis Libby (Cheney's chief of staff). The document, entitled Rebuilding America's Defences: Strategies, Forces And Resources For A New Century, was written in September 2000 by the neo-conservative think-tank Project for the New American Century (PNAC). The plan shows Bush's cabinet intended to take military control of the Gulf region whether or not Saddam Hussein was in power. It says: 'The United States has for decades sought to play a more permanent role in Gulf regional security. While the unresolved conflict with Iraq provides the immediate justification, the need for a substantial American force presence in the Gulf transcends the issue of the regime of Saddam Hussein.' The PNAC document supports a 'blueprint for maintaining global US pre-eminence, precluding the rise of a great power rival, and shaping the international security order in line with American principles and interests'. This 'American grand strategy' must be advanced for 'as far into the future as possible', the report says. It also calls for the US to 'fight and decisively win multiple, simultaneous major theatre wars' as a 'core mission'. The report describes American armed forces abroad as 'the cavalry on the new American frontier'. The PNAC blueprint supports an earlier document written by Wolfowitz and Libby that said the US must 'discourage advanced industrial nations from challenging our leadership or even aspiring to a larger regional or global role'. The PNAC report also: l refers to key allies such as the UK as 'the most effective and efficient means of exercising American global leadership'; l describes peace-keeping missions as 'demanding American political leadership rather than that of the United Nations'; l reveals worries in the administration that Europe could rival the USA; l says 'even should Saddam pass from the scene' bases in Saudi Arabia and Kuwait will remain permanently -- despite domestic opposition in the Gulf regimes to the stationing of US troops --", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:020907pnacprojectnewamericancentury.txt:0:2fe7e71ee8a4", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 7085, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "020907pnacprojectnewamericancentury.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "020907pnacprojectnewamericancentury", "chunk_index": 1, "text": "to key allies such as the UK as 'the most effective and efficient means of exercising American global leadership'; l describes peace-keeping missions as 'demanding American political leadership rather than that of the United Nations'; l reveals worries in the administration that Europe could rival the USA; l says 'even should Saddam pass from the scene' bases in Saudi Arabia and Kuwait will remain permanently -- despite domestic opposition in the Gulf regimes to the stationing of US troops -- as 'Iran may well prove as large a threat to US interests as Iraq has'; l spotlights China for 'regime change' saying 'it is time to increase the presence of American forces in southeast Asia'. This, it says, may lead to 'American and allied power providing the spur to the process of democratisation in China'; l calls for the creation of 'US Space Forces', to dominate space, and the total control of cyberspace to prevent 'enemies' using the internet against the US; l hints that, despite threatening war against Iraq for developing weapons of mass destruction, the US may consider developing biological weapons -- which the nation has banned -- in decades to come. It says: 'New methods of attack -- electronic, 'non-lethal', biological -- will be more widely available ... combat likely will take place in new dimensions, in space, cyberspace, and perhaps the world of microbes ... advanced forms of biological warfare that can 'target' specific genotypes may transform biological warfare from the realm of terror to a politically useful tool'; l and pinpoints North Korea, Libya, Syria and Iran as dangerous regimes and says their existence justifies the creation of a 'world-wide command-and-control system'. Tam Dalyell, the Labour MP, father of the House of Commons and one of the leading rebel voices against war with Iraq, said: 'This is garbage from right-wing think-tanks stuffed with chicken-hawks -- men who have never seen the horror of war but are in love with the idea of war. Men like Cheney, who were draft-dodgers in the Vietnam war. 'This is a blueprint for US world domination -- a new world order of their making. These are the thought processes of fantasist Americans who want to control the world. I am appalled that a British Labour Prime Minister should have got into bed with a crew which has this moral standing.'

Bush's arrival in Sarasota on Sept. 10. \"He was calling us by name. He was laughing.\" \"That name, Moo-Moo,\" the president said. \"I'll never forget that.\" \"I'll never forget your name, either,\" Yorsangchai replied. Yorsangchai, a waiter at the Colony Beach & Tennis Resort, is one of a handful of Southwest Florida residents who met with the president in the final hours leading up to the attacks on Sept. 11, 2001. The waiters, resort managers, teachers, GOP leaders and law enforcement officers paint a picture of a president at ease, one who was looking forward to meeting children at Emma E. Booker Elementary and touting a literacy program the morning of the attacks. The memory of lightheartedness, and the buzz of anticipation and excitement, is in stark contrast to the images most people saw of the president in Sarasota the morning of the attacks and aboard Air Force One later in the day. The Sarasota visit was to be largely unremarkable. In between his arrival and the school visit, Bush would dine with top Sarasota-Manatee Republicans, many of whom were glad to see him return to the state that was the stage for so many problems in the 2000 election. Instead, those in contact with Bush in the hours and minutes leading up to and during the attacks became part of history, witnessing a president just before his defining moment. Some witnessed that moment as it happened, as Bush learned of the attacks at Booker. He made his first address to the nation from there.

Instead, those in contact with Bush in the hours and minutes leading up to and during the attacks became part of history, witnessing a president just before his defining moment. Some witnessed that moment as it happened, as Bush learned of the attacks at Booker. He made his first address to the nation from there. Local authorities who had assisted the Secret Service in protecting VIPs before had to deal with the reality of getting the president to safety. And the Colony, where the Bush team had been staying, was used by the Bush administration as an information center during the disaster. \"They had evacuated all the government buildings,\" said Katherine Klauber Moulton, manager of the upscale resort. At one point, as the attacks unfolded, a Secret Service agent told her: \"This is the temporary White House.\" Hours before, everything was different. \"There was this light spirit,\" Moulton recalled of the night of Sept. 10. \"There was lighthearted conversations, easy communication and stories going back and forth. It was very comfortable.\" Big news The buildup for the president's arrival began about a week before. Tramm Hudson, chairman of the Republican Party of Sarasota County, was on the 16th tee at the Longboat Key Club when his cell phone rang. On the other end was Ron Ciaravella, owner of Dolphin Aviation, who told Hudson he had just sold 40,000 gallons of jet fuel to the Secret Service. The president was coming the next Monday. Hudson got in touch with the governor's office, which told him that as far as presidential visits go, this one would be quiet and uneventful. The big event was a visit to Booker, but not much else. Hudson was told to tell no one. Across Sarasota Bay, at Booker Elementary, Principal Gwendolyn Tose- Rigell watched as Secret Service agents \"gently took over\" her campus the morning of Sept. 6. Tose-Rigell had been called by White House officials five weeks earlier and told that Bush might come to Sarasota to talk to students about reading. The principal was interviewed by White House staffers, then by an official at the Florida Department of Education. Tose-Rigell, too, was sworn to secrecy. She was told \"a couple of people\" in an advance team would show up. \"Instead of a couple of people, it was an entourage,\" she said. \"The kids were saying, 'Who are all those men in black?'\" The 150 parents, students and teachers invited to the Sept. 11 event had to attend a meeting at the school with Bush staff two days before it. They were told where to stand, what to do and what not to do. Workers rearranged the school's library to better accommodate lighting for television cameras.

A White House stage artist, not teachers or students, designed the childish decorations that were eventually put on the wall behind the president. **At the Colony, the Secret Service was getting everything secured for when the president arrived on Sept. 10. That included snipers and surface-to-air missiles on the roof and the Coast Guard patrolling just offshore.** Everything was going perfectly. Soup and steak On Sept. 10, Bush swooped into Jacksonville for a brief stop, then headed to Sarasota. Moulton and her stepmother got the president's room ready. They vacuumed and cleaned the mirrors twice, and made the bed with some of the family's fine French linens. They tucked in the corners, smoothed out the sheets, then did it again until the bed -- and room -- was flawless. The Secret Service then did one last run-through. They left it messy, by presidential visit standards, so Moulton made the room flawless one more time. A little over a half-hour later, the president pulled up to the Colony in his armored, black limousine. Moulton raced downstairs. \"Welcome, Mr. President,\" she said. \"We are very pleased to have you.\" Bush greeted everybody there, including a few staffers pushed into a side room. His mood was great. At 6:30 p.m., Bush got on an elevator operated by maintenance man Kenny Kufahl, who flubbed the controls. \"He said, 'Son, relax a minute,'\" Kufahl recalled Bush saying. \"You're making my men nervous,\" the president jokingly said, \"and that makes me nervous. We'll get through this OK.\" Downstairs, top Republicans awaited to dine with the president: Gov. Jeb Bush, the president's brother; former Gov. Bob Martinez; state Republican Party Chairman Al Cardenas; and state Sens. John McKay of Bradenton and Lisa Carlton of Sarasota, among others. At the dinner table, the group talked about everything, from sports to Katherine Harris, who was out of the country. Somebody joked that the president should make her an ambassador so Hudson could run for Congress instead. \"It was like sitting at the table with a bunch of your frat brothers talking about baseball,\" Hudson said. The president had chili con queso, Texas tortilla soup and a New York strip steak, cooked medium and served with pinto beans. He drank a few non-alcoholic beers. All of the food was prepared under the watchful eyes of Secret Service agents stationed in the kitchen. One guy even drank the water before Bush did. The dinner tab was $1,172.72.

All of the food was prepared under the watchful eyes of Secret Service agents stationed in the kitchen. One guy even drank the water before Bush did. The dinner tab was $1,172.72. Before heading upstairs to sleep on the fine linens, Bush signed a few menus for his guests, including one for Moo-Moo Yorsangchai. Ready The next morning, Bush went for a jog around a golf course at the Longboat Key Club. Agents in golf carts followed as he ran with a Bloomberg News reporter. Four and a half miles in 42 minutes. At 8 a.m., Manatee County Sheriff Charlie Wells, Sarasota County Sheriff Bill Balkwill, then-Sarasota Police Chief Gordon Jolly and Manatee County sheriff's Col. Ken Pearson met at the Colony for a brief chat with the president before they joined his motorcade to the elementary school. \"He is totally unsuspecting about what is to happen,\" Wells said. \"Here's a guy just ready to take on the day. It looked like, to me, he's saying, 'Glad to see you, but I'm ready to get on to the school and meet the kids.'\" The motorcade arrived at Booker shortly before 9 a.m. School buses were lined up in front of the school to form a barricade. Agents on horseback patrolled the campus on Martin Luther King Jr. Way. Snipers were on the roof. All the phone lines were tapped, and one was linked directly to the White House. \"It was the safest place in the world,\" teacher Sandra Kay Daniels said. \"If you blew your nose and it wasn't time for you to blow your nose, they knew it.\" Tose-Rigell had been instructed to greet Bush at his limo and introduce him to the crowd. But on arrival, Bush was instead whisked into a side room to take a telephone call from National Security Adviser Condoleeza Rice. After, the president told Tose-Rigell that a plane hit the World Trade Center, but that his visit would continue while his staff gathered more details. Just after 9 a.m., Bush entered Daniels' second-grade classroom. She began a lesson as the Secret Service agents lying in the trusses above her room listened along with the president and the children. Suddenly, a Marine responsible for carrying Bush's phone marched up to Balkwill, who was standing in a nearby side room. \"Can you get me to a television?\" the Marine asked while listening to someone talk to him in his ear piece. \"We're not sure what's going on, but we need to see a television.\" Three Secret Service agents, a SWAT member, the Marine and Balkwill turned on the television in a nearby front office as", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:020910heraldtribune.surfacetoairmissiles.txt:3:21d8dae27f88", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 7091, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "020910heraldtribune.surfacetoairmissiles.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "020910heraldtribune.surfacetoairmissiles", "chunk_index": 4, "text": "the president and the children.

The president let Daniels finish her lesson, then returned to the side room and got back on the phone with Rice. The president told Tose-Rigell what had happened: \"He said what we thought was a commercial plane (accident) was actually a terrorist attack.\" At 9:30 a.m., Bush stepped up to the podium in Booker's library and delivered the news of a terrorist attack on the country. Seconds later, the president was whisked away. Said Tose-Rigell: \"It was like a blink, and poof, he was gone.\" FAIR USE NOTICE: This site contains copyrighted material the use of which has not always been specifically authorized by the copyright owner.

One of the largest structures ever built had failed, at a terrible cost in lives. When warned of danger, those in charge had shrugged. Many died because the rescue effort was plagued by communication breakdowns, a lack of coordination, failure to prepare. These findings on the sinking of the Titanic entered the public record after the Carpathia docked at the Chelsea piers in Manhattan on April 18, 1912, with the 705 survivors plucked from the North Atlantic. Starting the next morning at the Waldorf-Astoria, the barely dry witnesses provided a rich body of facts about the accident, the Titanic, and maritime practices to the United States Senate Commerce Committee, which held 18 days of hearings. Their testimony gave form to a distant horror, shaping law and history. No inquiry remotely similar in scope, energy or transparency has examined the attacks of last Sept. 11, the devastating collapse of two of the world's tallest structures, the deaths at the Pentagon or on United Airlines Flight 93 in Pennsylvania. A handful of tightly focused reviews have taken place mostly in secret, conducted by private consultants, or by Congressional committees. One year later, the public knows less about the circumstances of 2,801 deaths at the foot of Manhattan in broad daylight than people in 1912 knew within weeks about the Titanic, which sank in the middle of an ocean in the dead of night. That hardly seems possible, considering that 9/11 iconography has been absorbed into everything from football pageants to pitches by speakers peddling lessons in leadership. And yet, says John F. Timoney, once a senior police commander in New York and the former police commissioner in Philadelphia, the events of Sept. 11 are among the most rare in American public life: true catastrophes that have gone fundamentally unscrutinized. ''You can hardly point to a cataclysmic event", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:020911nytimes.txt:0:0f97ef0c7c36", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 7094, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "020911nytimes.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "020911nytimes", "chunk_index": 1, "text": "ocean in the dead of night.

Timoney, once a senior police commander in New York and the former police commissioner in Philadelphia, the events of Sept. 11 are among the most rare in American public life: true catastrophes that have gone fundamentally unscrutinized. ''You can hardly point to a cataclysmic event in our history, whether it was the sinking of the Titanic, the Pearl Harbor attack, the Kennedy assassination, when a blue-ribbon panel did not set out to establish the facts and, where appropriate, suggest reforms,'' Mr. Timoney said. ''That has not happened here.'' In Washington, a special joint Congressional committee met a dozen times in secret to investigate the performance of the intelligence services, but planned public hearings have been postponed. In New York, which suffered the greatest loss of life in the attacks, no formal review of the emergency response was opened until January, when Michael R. Bloomberg succeeded Rudolph W. Giuliani as mayor. And even then, the city proceeded with maximum circumspection. The new administration commissioned McKinsey & Company, a management consulting firm, to assess the Police and Fire Departments separately. Mr. Bloomberg pointedly said that the two reports ''should not be described as investigations; they have not attempted moment-by-moment re-creations of the events of 9/11.'' The purpose, he said, was only to identify ''specific and important opportunities'' for improvement. Nor has there been a wide public demand for answers, to the frustration of a handful of victims' families. Why this national reluctance to face the country's bloodiest modern disaster in all its dimensions? The familiar narrative and images of heroism surely offer comfort and pride. Any wide-ranging study is bound to find unflattering profiles of self-inflicted wounds, poor preparation, even a kind of mass stupor in the face of rising threats. Islamic fundamentalists had, after all, been killing Americans and attacking American symbols for a decade, in New York, in Saudi Arabia, in Africa, in Yemen. They tried to knock over the twin towers in 1993, and were caught plotting to crash hijacked airplanes into landmarks in 1994 and 1995. Legislators who examine even lame and flimsy intelligence operations run the risk of seeming to make matters worse by opening up methods to scrutiny by enemies. Now the F.B.I. is investigating Congressional staff members and senators to see if they were the source of news reports that said the National Security Agency had bobbled hints of a pending attack. In New York, different questions have undermined searching inquiries into the emergency response. The adequacy of the building code for skyscrapers, while a technical issue, is by definition a matter of life and death. Also by definition, it is a question of costs for the real estate industry.", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:020911nytimes.txt:1:466f231c9dda", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 7095, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "020911nytimes.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "020911nytimes", "chunk_index": 2, "text": "the F.B.I. is investigating Congressional staff members and senators to see if they were the source of news reports that said the National Security Agency had bobbled hints of a pending attack. In New York, different questions have undermined searching inquiries into the emergency response. The adequacy of the building code for skyscrapers, while a technical issue, is by definition a matter of life and death. Also by definition, it is a question of costs for the real estate industry. A joint government-industry task force is now studying the New York codes, separate from the emergency responses. After the 1993 trade center bombing, a similar group made almost no changes because of resistance from the building industry, said Alan Reiss, who was the director of the trade center until last summer. By shaping basic structural requirements, the codes resonate on issues as basic to survival as the number of lifeboats a ship like the Titanic must carry: these laws effectively determine how rescue workers attack fires, whether people can escape from elevators and how many stairways are necessary. At least 1,100 people survived the initial impacts from the planes, but were trapped. How many might have been saved if the buildings had stood longer? The city has not explored that question. While Mr. Bloomberg endorsed proposed changes in police and fire management practices, the mayor has been plainly uninterested in revisiting the specifics of what went wrong on Sept. 11, saying that it was far more pressing to maintain flexible, well-equipped forces than to spend months going to school on the last calamity. ''Every single major event is different from all others,'' the mayor said when he released the McKinsey reports last month. ''The training of how you would respond to the last incident is not really important.'' Yet officials in New York City did have a blueprint for an attack of this sort, and it was the last attack. In 1993, fundamentalists parked a truck bomb in the trade center basement. Six people were killed. For rescuers, ''Communications in that complex was the No. 1 issue, a big problem that had to be fixed,'' said Dennis Smith, the author of ''Report From Ground Zero'' (Viking, 2002) and a retired firefighter who has studied both attacks. The firefighters returned Sept. 11 carrying the same radio equipment, with one big difference: the department had arranged to link the radios to a system of boosters and cable lines. Even so, nearly every surviving firefighter reported problems sending and getting messages. Yet Fire Department officials did not obtain the single known recording of their operations inside the tower until after The New York Times reported its existence in July. At that point, the response study had already been drafted. Mr. Reiss, of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, said the Fire Department needed to figure out why the changes did", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:020911nytimes.txt:2:2e201a40c1f1", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 7096, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "020911nytimes.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "020911nytimes", "chunk_index": 3, "text": "system of boosters and cable lines.

At that point, the response study had already been drafted. Mr. Reiss, of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, said the Fire Department needed to figure out why the changes did not work. ''I felt like we spent a lot of money, we tried to do the right thing, but it didn't work,'' he said. Mr. Reiss was not interviewed for the Fire Department report, which recommends that the city create tax incentives for other high-rise owners to install the sorts of technical improvements made at the trade center -- the very ones that, for unexplored reasons, did not work. Another residue of the 1993 attack was the use of helicopters by the police, who had landed on a roof and removed people stranded on the upper floors. The firefighters, whose department has no helicopter, saw the police as showboats taking risks. Afterward, the Port Authority, with the agreement of the Fire Department, decided to lock the roof doors as a security measure. On Sept. 11, some 200 people tried to get onto the south tower's roof but could not open the door. The police decided a landing was too dangerous. One pilot noted that he did not see anyone on the roof. The city studies did not consider the wisdom of locking roof doors in skyscrapers, and do not mention if such arrangements exist elsewhere. As the towers were burning, Randy Mastro, a lawyer who served as deputy mayor under Mr. Giuliani, was asked on CNN if the city had changed its approach since 1993. Indeed it had, he said. In 1993, Mr. Mastro said, ''There was no coordinated city response. There was no Mayor's Office of Emergency Management. Rudy Giuliani established that. It's been one of the hallmarks of his tenure. And unfortunately, there are circumstances like this one where that coordinated effort has to come into play and is coming into play now.'' The belief in the coordinated public safety efforts of the Giuliani administration turned out to be much like the belief in the unsinkability of the Titanic. Early in the crisis, the Office of Emergency Management had to be evacuated. It had been placed in the trade center complex by Mr. Giuliani, against advice that it was unwise to put an emergency center in a terrorist target. The Police and Fire Departments barely spoke on 9/11. They set up separate command posts. The firefighters stayed on the ground, 900 feet below fires that the police in helicopters were seeing up close.

The firefighters stayed on the ground, 900 feet below fires that the police in helicopters were seeing up close. The two departments had not practiced helicopter operations for at least a year before the attack. Literally as Mr. Mastro was speaking, the police in the sky were urging that everyone pull back from the tower, saying that a collapse appeared inevitable. This message was sent over police radios, but went unheard by firefighters. As many as 100 of them were resting on the 19th floor of the north tower. ''A wall of firemen, shooting the breeze, as if we were in a park,'' said Deputy Chief Joseph Baccellieri, the commanding officer of the New York State Court Officers Association. The McKinsey consultants evaluated 16 tasks undertaken by the police on 9/11. None involved cooperating with other agencies. Important as that is, the McKinsey consultants wrote, it was ''outside the scope'' of their assignment. As for Deputy Chief Baccellieri and other witnesses who saw crowds of doomed firefighters resting on the 19th floor, they all said they would gladly share their accounts with anyone investigating the events of Sept. 11. So far, no one has called. FAIR USE NOTICE: This site contains copyrighted material the use of which has not always been specifically authorized by the copyright owner.

The quote about the Arab terrorists' plan to fly a bomb-laden plane into the World Trade Center is in the first sentence. ** ** ****September 19, 2002, Thursday ** **NATIONAL DESK ** THREATS AND RESPONSES: THE INVESTIGATION; U.S. FAILED TO ACT ON WARNINGS IN '98 OF A PLANE ATTACK By JAMES RISEN (NYT) 1370 words WASHINGTON, Sept. 18 -- The United States intelligence community was told in 1998 that Arab terrorists were planning to fly a bomb-laden plane into the World Trade Center, but the F.B.I. and the Federal Aviation Administration did not take the threat seriously, a Congressional investigation into the Sept. 11 attacks has found. That August 1998 intelligence report from the Central Intelligence Agency was just one of several warnings the United States received, but did not seriously analyze, in the years leading up to the Sept. 11 attacks that were detailed today at a Congressional hearing. The existence of the 1998 intelligence report was disclosed in a presentation by the committee's staff director, Eleanor Hill. The report concluded that there was evidence of a growing interest by Al Qaeda and related groups in high-profile attacks inside the United States years before the attacks on the trade center and the Pentagon. The Congressional report was the first disclosure that there was specific intelligence about terrorist plans to crash airplanes into the trade center, though officials said that those plans did not appear to be connected to the Sept. 11 attack. And while the joint committee made public several intelligence reports that had been received in the years before Sept. 11 that related to Al Qaeda's intentions to launch an attack inside the United States and its interest in using aircraft for terrorism, Ms. Hill emphasized that the joint committee had still not found a ''smoking gun'' that could have helped prevent the Sept. 11 attacks. ''People have said there was no smoking gun,'' Ms. Hill said. ''But there was still a lot out there that was never pulled together.''", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:020919nytimes.txt:0:6b5a554c9ee3", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 7100, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "020919nytimes.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "020919nytimes", "chunk_index": 1, "text": "reports that had been received in the years before Sept. 11 that related to Al Qaeda's intentions to launch an attack inside the United States and its interest in using aircraft for terrorism, Ms. Hill emphasized that the joint committee had still not found a ''smoking gun'' that could have helped prevent the Sept. 11 attacks. ''People have said there was no smoking gun,'' Ms. Hill said. ''But there was still a lot out there that was never pulled together.'' In fact, from 1998 to the summer of 2001, the C.I.A., the F.B.I. and other agencies repeatedly received reports of Al Qaeda's interest in attacking Washington and New York, either with airplanes or other means. The threat level grew so high that by December 1998, the director of central intelligence, George J. Tenet, issued a ''declaration of war'' on Al Qaeda, in a memorandum circulated in the intelligence community. Yet, Ms. Hill said, the intelligence agencies failed to adequately follow up on the declaration, and by Sept. 10, 2001, the F.B.I. still had only one analyst assigned full time to Al Qaeda. The 1998 intelligence report about the trade center cited plans by a group of unidentified Arabs, who the United States now believes had ties to Al Qaeda, to fly an explosives-laden plane from a foreign country into the trade center. American intelligence officials said today that despite the similarities, they did not believe that the 1998 report was related to the Sept. 11 attack. Still, the Congressional panel criticized the way in which the intelligence was handled, particularly by the F.B.I. and aviation agency. The committee said the F.B.I.'s New York office ''took no action on the information.'' The flight agency, meanwhile, ''found the plot highly unlikely,'' because of the state of the unidentified foreign country's aviation program. ''We did review the technical aspects of the information, but any decisions about whether it was credible was based on an F.B.I. determination,'' a spokesman for the Transportation Department said. Law enforcement officials said the F.B.I.'s conclusion that the threat was not credible was based on the seeming difficulty of launching the attack from the unidentified country. Recent months have seen a flood of reports concerning what kind of information intelligence agencies had about plans for a terrorist attack on the United States. For example, it has already been reported that in 1996, a Pakistani terrorist, Abdul Hakim Murad, confessed to federal agents that he was learning to fly an aircraft in order to crash a plane into the C.I.A. headquarters. It was disclosed in June that the National Security Agency had intercepted two cryptic communications the day before the Sept. 11 attacks. One indicated that ''the big match'' was scheduled for the next day; the other referred to Sept. 11 as ''zero hour.'' Some officials say it was not clear the messages related to the Sept. 11 attacks.

Agency analysts did not translate them until Sept. 12. Still, today's disclosures provide the most detailed official description of intelligence lapses. While that August 1998 report most closely paralleled the final attack, the C.I.A. received other warnings in that period of Al Qaeda's interest in using aircraft against targets in United States. In September 1998, intelligence agencies obtained information warning that Osama bin Laden's next major operation could involve flying an aircraft loaded with explosives into an American airport and then detonating it. That same fall, another intelligence report stated that there was a Qaeda plot in the works that involved the use of aircraft in both New York and Washington. Yet the reports did not prompt the C.I.A. or other intelligence agencies to conduct an analysis of that specific threat to American aviation, the joint committee found. In addition, the aviation agency did not change its traditional assumptions that airplane hijackings were not suicide missions. American airlines directed their flight crews not to fight back against hijackers. But the reports of Al Qaeda's interest in attacks in the United States extended beyond aircraft. In the spring of 1999, the C.I.A. received another report that Mr. bin Laden wanted to attack a government building in Washington. In August 1999, another report said Al Qaeda had apparently chosen the secretary of state, the defense secretary and the C.I.A. director for assassination. The C.I.A. had been told the previous year that Mr. bin Laden and his lieutenants had also agreed to issue $9 million bounties for the assassination of four top intelligence officers, whom the report did not identify, after the United increased a reward for Mr. bin Laden. In the spring and summer of 2001, American intelligence picked up several reports that strongly indicated that Al Qaeda intended a major attack against American targets. Since Sept. 11, American intelligence officials have said that most of that intelligence suggested that the attack was to be overseas. Still, there were some reports in that period that referred to domestic attacks, the joint committee revealed in its interim report released today. In April 2001, an individual with terrorist connections speculated that Mr. bin Laden would be interested in using commercial pilots as terrorists. The individual warned that Al Qaeda wanted to mount ''spectacular and traumatic'' attacks like the first bombing of the trade center in 1993. The C.I.A. first created a unit inside its counterterrorism", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:020919nytimes.txt:2:309747871e8a", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 7102, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "020919nytimes.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "020919nytimes", "chunk_index": 3, "text": "to be overseas.

The individual warned that Al Qaeda wanted to mount ''spectacular and traumatic'' attacks like the first bombing of the trade center in 1993. The C.I.A. first created a unit inside its counterterrorism center to track Mr. bin Laden in 1996. But the joint committee's report strongly suggests that it was not until 1998 that officials throughout the F.B.I., C.I.A. and other agencies began to recognize the urgent threat posed by Al Qaeda, after the August 1998 bombings of two American embassies in East Africa. The response of intelligence agencies to the Qaeda threat varied widely. On Dec. 4, 1998, Mr. Tenet issued his declaration of war, saying, ''I want no resource or people spared.'' Yet the joint committee found that few of the F.B.I. agents interviewed by it had ever heard of Mr. Tenet's declaration. The panel also concluded that prior to Sept. 11, only one F.B.I. analyst was assigned full time to Al Qaeda, although others were working on individual terrorist cases related to Mr. bin Laden's network. The joint committee report also said that in 1999, the C.I.A.'s counterterrorism center had only three analysts assigned full time to Al Qaeda. Both the C.I.A. and the F.B.I. disputed those figures today. Law enforcement officials said the committee's numbers were misleading, because at the time of last year's attacks, the F.B.I.'s Al Qaeda analysts were not assigned to a separate analytical section, but to two operational groups with about 30 people.

WASHINGTON -- Intelligence agencies were aware of numerous threats that terrorists might use airplanes as weapons against the U.S., despite government claims following Sept. 11 that the World Trade Center and Pentagon attacks came like bolts from the blue. More than a year after the four hijackings, the joint House and Senate intelligence committees held their first public hearing yesterday into intelligence failures leading up to the attacks, detailing intelligence available before the assault. Based on the comments of several lawmakers, interest appears to be growing for the appointment of an independent commission to delve further into the roots of the attacks and the efforts -- or lack thereof -- to protect the U.S. beforehand. Meanwhile, the two panels will continue their probe into what went wrong and whether it could have been avoided. A 30-page report they released yesterday showed intelligence officials knew last summer that al Qaeda both hoped to use planes as weapons and sought to strike a violent blow within the U.S. But the investigation has yet to yield direct intelligence that would show with any certainty that the disaster could have been averted. \"From 1994 through as late as August 2001, the intelligence community had received information indicating that international terrorists had seriously considered the use of airplanes as a means of carrying out terrorist attacks,\" said the report, which was compiled from more than 400 interviews and after reviewing 400,000 pages of documents. Much if not all of the report's findings already have been reported, however, as information filtered out of the closed-door hearings held by the panels earlier this year. \"These public hearings are part of our search for the truth -- not to point fingers or pin blame,\" said Sen. Bob Graham (D., Fla.), chairman of the Senate intelligence Committee. He added, though, that more probes are to come. The top Republican on the Senate panel, Richard Shelby of Alabama, had harsher words, calling the attacks \"an intelligence failure of unprecedented magnitude.\" He also questioned whether congressional investigators had sufficient time or resources to complete a full accounting of any intelligence failures. For example, the report detailed examples of intelligence showing Osama bin", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:020919wsj.txt:0:dfd4c92b08bc", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 7105, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "020919wsj.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "020919wsj", "chunk_index": 1, "text": "point fingers or pin blame,\" said Sen.

For example, the report detailed examples of intelligence showing Osama bin Laden intended to carry out a strike inside U.S. borders, including an August 1998 report that \"a group of unidentified Arabs planned to fly an explosive-laden plane from a foreign country into the World Trade Center.\" The Federal Bureau of Investigation relayed the information to the Federal Aviation Administration, which deemed the plot unlikely, the report said. While there were signs of an impending attack, officials say there was never anything specific enough to act on. \"All of this seems more apparent with the benefit of 20-20 hindsight,\" said one U.S. intelligence official. At the same time, the report \"certainly points to the CIA and intelligence community having reported on the seriousness and the immediacy of the threat posed by bin Laden and al Qaeda,\" the official said.

WTC.** September 25, 2002 UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK SR INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS INSURANCE CO. LTD., Plaintiff-Counterclaim Defendant, -v.- WORLD TRADE CENTER PROPERTIES LLC, et al. Defendants-Counterclaimants. 01 Civ. 9291 (JSM) OPINION & ORDER WORLD TRADE CENTER PROPERTIES LLC, et al., Counterclaimants, -v.- ALLIANZ INSURANCE COMPANY, et al. Additional Counterclaim Defendants. JOHN S. MARTIN, Jr., District Judge: This litigation has already given rise to several opinions of the Court. Familiarity with those opinions and the background of this litigation is assumed. At the time of the terrorist attack on the World Trade Center on September 11, 2001, over twenty individual insurance companies had signed binders which obligated them to provide property damage insurance, but, with minor exceptions, they had not issued formal insurance policies. Presently before the Court are motions for partial summary judgment by Hartford Fire Insurance Company, Royal Indemnity Company and St. Paul Fire and Marine Insurance Company. In each of these motions, the insurer argues that at the time it issued its binder it agreed to be bound on the basis of a specific form of insurance provided by Willis of New York, Inc. (\"Willis\"), the broker for the Silverstein Parties, and that this form - the WilProp form - contained a definition of \"occurrence\" under which the terrorist attack on the World Trade Center is unambiguously a single occurrence. Accordingly, each of the insurers seeks to limit its liability to the Silverstein Parties to one single payment in the face amount of the policy. While conceding that the insurers' reading of the WilProp occurrence definition is the most reasonable one, the Silverstein Parties argue that it is not the only reasonable reading, and that therefore the question of the number of occurrences under the WilProp form must be decided by a jury. More significantly, however, the Silverstein Parties do not concede that the WilProp definition of occurrence is incorporated into the binders. They assert that at the time these insurers signed the binders they were well aware that they were committing themselves to participate in a process in which they would ultimately agree to be bound to the contract terms negotiated by the insureds and the lead underwriter, which in this case became The Travelers Insurance Company. Thus, the Silverstein Parties argue that as of September 11th, each of these insurers was bound to the terms", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:020925newsday.txt:0:67ea7fedcdc4", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 7108, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "020925newsday.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "020925newsday", "chunk_index": 1, "text": "occurrence is incorporated into the binders.

Thus, the Silverstein Parties argue that as of September 11th, each of these insurers was bound to the terms to which Travelers and the insureds had agreed as of that date. I. THE TERMS OF THE BINDERS In large measure, the position of the Silverstein Parties rests on the argument that the binders at issue here were what Judge Leval has characterized as a \"binding preliminary commitment.\" As he explained in Teachers Insurance & Annuity Association v. Tribune Co., 670 F. Supp. 491, 498 (S.D.N.Y. 1987): Preliminary contracts with binding force can be of at least two distinct types. One occurs when the parties have reached complete agreement (including the agreement to be bound) on all the issues perceived to require negotiation. Such an agreement is preliminary only in form--only in the sense that the parties desire a more elaborate formalization of the agreement. The second stage is not necessary; it is merely considered desirable. * * * * * The second and different sort of preliminary binding agreement is one that expresses mutual commitment to a contract on agreed major terms, while recognizing the existence of open terms that remain to be negotiated. Although the existence of open terms generally suggests that binding agreement has not been reached, that is not necessarily so. For the parties can bind themselves to a concededly incomplete agreement in the sense that they accept a mutual commitment to negotiate together in good faith in an effort to reach final agreement within the scope that has been settled in the preliminary agreement. * * * * * This obligation does not guarantee that the final contract will be concluded if both parties comport with their obligation, as good faith differences in the negotiation of the open issues may prevent a reaching of final contract. See also Adjustrite Systems, Inc. v. GAB Business Services, Inc., 145 F.3d 543, 548 (2d Cir. 1998); Shann v. Dunk, 84 F.3d 73, 77-78 (2d Cir. 1996); Arcadian Phosphates, Inc. v. Arcadian Corp., 884 F.2d 69, 71-72 (2d Cir. 1989). However, insurance binders are not either one of the types of preliminary contracts referred to by Judge Leval. An insurance binder is a unique type of contract. While not all of the terms of the insurance contract are set forth in the binder, \"[a] binder' is a present contract of insurance...\" Ell Dee Clothing Co. v. Marsh, 247 N.Y. 392, 396 (1928). A binder is \"a short method of issuing a temporary policy for the convenience of all parties,", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:020925newsday.txt:1:67559dde04de", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 7109, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "020925newsday.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "020925newsday", "chunk_index": 2, "text": "1989).

A binder is \"a short method of issuing a temporary policy for the convenience of all parties, to continue until the execution of the formal one.\" Lipman v. Niagara Fire Ins. Co., 121 N.Y. 454, 458 (1890). The terms of a binder are not left to future negotiation. Rather, as the New York Court of Appeals explained in Employers Commercial Union Ins. Co. v. Firemen's Fund Ins. Co., 45 N.Y.2d 608, 612-13 (1978): It is a common and necessary practice in the world of insurance, where speed often is of the essence, for the agent to use this quick and informal device to record the giving of protection pending the execution and delivery of a more conventionally detailed policy of insurance. Courts, recognizing that the cryptic nature of binders is born of necessity and that many policy clauses are either stereotypes or mandated by public regulation, are not loath to infer that conditions and limitations usual to the contemplated coverage were intended to be part of the parties' contract during the binder period. (Matter of Seiderman v. Herman Perla, Inc., 268 N.Y. 188; Ell Dee Clothing Co. v. Marsh, 247 N.Y. 392). The law of New York with respect to binders does not look to the negotiations of the parties to see what terms might ultimately have been incorporated into a formal policy. Nor does it suggest that the parties will not be bound if they fail to agree on important terms after negotiating in good faith. To the contrary, the New York Court of Appeals has made clear that when a binder is signed, \"the contract of insurance [is] closed and the binder [becomes] in effect the same as a regular insurance policy . . . .\" Seiderman v. Herman Perla, Inc., 268 N.Y. 188, 190 (1935). To consider a binder merely a preliminary agreement could deprive the insured of \"protection pending the execution and delivery of a more conventionally detailed policy of insurance.\" Employers Commercial Union, 45 N.Y.2d at 612-13.1 While there is evidence indicating that, had the terrorist attack of September 11, 2001, not occurred, the insurers would all have ultimately agreed to policies that did not define the term \"occurrence\", that possibility is irrelevant. Under New York law, the question to be determined here is not, \"What were the terms to which the parties might ultimately have agreed to become bound?\" but rather, \"What were the terms to which they were bound?\" Where, as here, there is no completed written contract setting forth", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:020925newsday.txt:2:d7befa1ca863", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 7110, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "020925newsday.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "020925newsday", "chunk_index": 3, "text": "that, had the terrorist attack of September 11, 2001, not occurred, the insurers would all have ultimately agreed to policies that did not define the term \"occurrence\", that possibility is irrelevant.

U.S. West Fin. Servs., Inc. v. Tollman, 786 F. Supp. 333, 342 (S.D.N.Y. 1992); Joseph Victori Wines, Inc. v. Vina Santa Carolina S.A., 933 F. Supp. 347 (S.D.N.Y. 1996). In making this inquiry, the reasoning in Martin Delicatessen v. Schumacher, 52 N.Y.2d 105, 109, 436 N.Y.S.2d 247, 249 (1981), applies. In that case, Judge Fuchsberg stated: [B]efore the power of law can be invoked to enforce a promise, it must be sufficiently certain and specific so that what was promised can be ascertained. Otherwise, a court, in intervening, would be imposing its own conception of what the parties should or might have undertaken, rather than confining itself to the implementation of a bargain to which they have mutually committed themselves. Thus, definiteness as to material matters is of the very essence in contract law. Impenetrable vagueness and uncertainty will not do (1 Corbin, Contracts, s 95, p. 394; 6 Encyclopedia of New York Law, Contracts, s 301; Restatement, Contracts 2d, s 32, Comment a). 52 N.Y.2d at 109, 436 N.Y.S.2d at 249. Thus, this Court does not have a roving commission to impose its conception of what is fair upon the parties before it. Nor may the Court consider the public interest in the rebuilding of the World Trade Center in deciding the question of whether the binders issued by these insurers entitle the Silverstein Parties to recover twice the face amount of the insurance they purchased. What the Court must do is examine the facts with respect to the negotiations between the brokers for the Silverstein Parties and each of these insurers to determine what the terms of their binders were on September 11, 2001. 1. Hartford Fire Insurance Co. A. Facts On June 7, 2001, Willis broker Timothy Boyd sent a property underwriting submission, including a copy of the WilProp form, to Hartford underwriter John Gemma. On June 28th, Gemma issued a quote to Boyd authorizing limits of $50 million excess of $75 million. After the heading, \"FORM\", the quote stated, \"Manuscript Forms Submitted With Attached Amendments.\" Gemma attached specific pages of the WilProp form, which he had amended, in addition to two pre-printed policy clauses", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:020925newsday.txt:3:1de6cda00aee", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 7111, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "020925newsday.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "020925newsday", "chunk_index": 4, "text": "Fire Insurance Co.

After the heading, \"FORM\", the quote stated, \"Manuscript Forms Submitted With Attached Amendments.\" Gemma attached specific pages of the WilProp form, which he had amended, in addition to two pre-printed policy clauses excluding coverage of certain pollution and electronic data recognition problems. Next to the heading, \"SUBJECT TO,\" Gemma typed the following: \"Policy Forms Must Be Received Within 60 Days of Inception Otherwise HSC Forms Will Be Used.\" On July 7th, Boyd e-mailed Gemma to see if Hartford would agree to \"drop down\" from its quoted $75 million attachment point to $50 million, and thereby participate with Travelers in the proposed layer of $400 to $450 million excess of $50 million. Boyd also forwarded an e-mail to Gemma that he had sent to Travelers the previous day, which noted the need to \"sort our non-concurrent terms and conditions\" as commitments are made. In response to Boyd's request for a modification of Hartford's participation, Gemma issued a new quote calling for $50 million as part of a $450 million layer excess of $50 million. After the heading, \"FORM,\" the quote stated, \"Manuscript Forms Submitted With Attached Amendments.\" On July 12th, as a result of objections from his superiors to the extent of the participation, Gemma sent Boyd an e-mail retracting Hartford's modified quotation and seeking to limit Hartford's participation to $25 million. In response, Boyd called Gemma and said that it was too late to limit Hartford's participation. According to Boyd, he informed Gemma at this time that the Travelers form would be used and Gemma requested a copy of the Travelers form once it was finalized. After speaking with Boyd, Gemma sought authorization from his supervisors to increase Hartford's participation from $25 million. Hartford's Boston office authorized Gemma to quote $32 million of a $50 million layer excess of $75 million. Gemma advised Boyd of this revised quotation by phone and e-mail. On July 17th, Boyd sent an e-mail to Gemma binding Hartford's $32 million in coverage. Boyd's e-mail stated: \"We [Willis] will issue formal documentation soonest.\" On July 18th, Boyd e-mailed Gemma and Gemma's assistant, urgently requesting Hartford's policy number for the Silverstein program. The following day, Gemma sent a one-page document entitled \"outline of our property BINDER.\" This document was prepared on the same form as Hartford's June 28, 2001 and July 9, 2001 quotations. Like those prior quotations, in its \"FORM\" section it stated, \"Manuscript Form Submitted With Attached Amendments.\" On July 20, 2001, Boyd e-mailed Gemma to advise him that Willis was \"working diligently with primary carriers to refine policy form\" and attached a \"Binder of Insurance.\" Under", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:020925newsday.txt:4:09b6452c393b", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 7112, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "020925newsday.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "020925newsday", "chunk_index": 5, "text": "the Silverstein program.

Like those prior quotations, in its \"FORM\" section it stated, \"Manuscript Form Submitted With Attached Amendments.\" On July 20, 2001, Boyd e-mailed Gemma to advise him that Willis was \"working diligently with primary carriers to refine policy form\" and attached a \"Binder of Insurance.\" Under the heading \"Property and Time Element Covered,\" the following language was included in the binder: \"And as incorporated into the manuscript form, in conjunction with the contract between the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey as ultimately agreed.\" According to Boyd, this section conveyed that coverage terms would be \"as ultimately agreed\" in the \"program policy form,\" meaning the Travelers form. Gemma made some changes to this document, which reflected the proposed amendments that had been attached to Hartford's June 28, 2001 quotation. Gemma also changed a section of the binder which read, \"Exclusions:--Per Policy Form as to be advised\" to read \"Exclusions: --Per Policy Form as quoted.\" Gemma then initialed and signed each page of the binder and returned it to Boyd. This binder did not include the phrase, \"Manuscript Forms Submitted With Attached Amendments.\" On July 24, 2001, the Silverstein Parties and Westfield closed on their leases with the Port Authority, after receiving binders and slips of coverage totaling $3.26 billion. There apparently were no communications of substance between the parties between the date of the closing and the terrorist attack on September 11th. B. Discussion The undisputed facts are that at the time Hartford bound itself to insure the World Trade Center complex, the only policy form that had been submitted to it was the WilProp form. In its original commitment and twice thereafter, Hartford's binders expressly indicated that it was binding in conformity with the \"Manuscript Forms Submitted With Attached Amendments.\" Despite these repeated manifestations of Hartford's intent to bind itself only to the terms of the manuscript form that had been submitted to it, i.e., the WilProp form, the Silverstein Parties contend that Hartford should be bound to a Travelers form which Hartford did not see before September 11th. To support this claim, they rely on the affidavit of an alleged expert in the custom and practices of the insurance industry who notes that it is customary in large placements like the World Trade Center, for one carrier to serve as the lead underwriter and for the other carriers to agree to follow the form agreed to by that carrier and the insured. Whether or not this is the practice in the industry is not relevant to the question before the Court. As noted earlier, the issue is not what contract Hartford might ultimately have agreed to when all negotiations were concluded. The", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:020925newsday.txt:5:8884cba73c98", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 7113, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "020925newsday.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "020925newsday", "chunk_index": 6, "text": "that it is customary in large placements like the World Trade Center, for one carrier to serve as the lead underwriter and for the other carriers to agree to follow the form agreed to by that carrier and the insured. Whether or not this is the practice in the industry is not relevant to the question before the Court. As noted earlier, the issue is not what contract Hartford might ultimately have agreed to when all negotiations were concluded. The issue here is what was the contract to which Hartford was bound on September 11th. To accept the testimony of an expert as to his opinion concerning the terms the parties would have agreed to \"would be imposing [his]...conception of what the parties should or might have undertaken, rather than confining [the inquiry]... to the implementation of a bargain to which [the insurer and the insured]... mutually committed themselves.\" Martin Delicatessen v. Schumacher, 52 N.Y.2d 105, 109, 436 N.Y.S.2d 247 (1981). Even in the absence of evidence to the contrary, it would be difficult to believe that Hartford would have bound itself, even temporarily, to provide millions of dollars of insurance coverage to the Silverstein Parties without a firm understanding of the essential terms of their agreement and would leave those terms to the discretion of some other carrier. Here, however, the evidence is all to the contrary. Hartford repeatedly indicated that it was binding itself to the terms of the \"Manuscript Form Submitted.\" It never expressed a willingness to be bound to a \"Manuscript Form To Be Submitted.\" The Silverstein Parties argue that the legend, \"Manuscript Form Submitted\" was not added to either of two Willis forms of Binder of Insurance which Boyd sent to Gemma, and which he either signed or modified on July 20th. However, Gemma did change wording in the July 20th binders that referred to a \"Policy Form to be advised\" to \"Policy Form as quoted.\" This clearly indicates that Hartford was not willing to be bound to some as yet undefined policy form but rather limited its commitment to the only policy form that had been submitted to it. In any event, while the parties dispute which of the documents exchanged on or about July 20th was \"the binder,\" none of the binders here was a fully integrated contract. Thus, it is appropriate to look to the terms of the signed documents, as well as other communications that preceded the issuance of the binder to ascertain the complete terms of their agreement. Joseph Victori Wines, Inc. v. Vina Santa Carolina S.A., 933 F.Supp. 347 (S.D.N.Y. 1996)(\"If the writing is not integrated, of course, parol evidence of additional contract terms may be admitted to complete the agreement, so long as the additional terms do not contradict the written terms.\") With the exception of the language, \"Policy Form to be advised,\" which Gemma revised, there was", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:020925newsday.txt:6:53aaeb39c1f3", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 7114, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "020925newsday.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "020925newsday", "chunk_index": 7, "text": "as other communications that preceded the issuance of the binder to ascertain the complete terms of their agreement.

Indeed, in communicating with Royal Indemnity, Boyd attached the WilProp policy form to an e-mail and wrote, \"We have included WilProp for Real Estate as a guideline form, although ultimate form must meet property definitions as contained in the contract with PA and Silverstein.\" Thus, even if the provision, \"And as incorporated into the manuscript form, in conjunction with the contract between the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey as ultimately agreed\" is read to refer to the WilProp manuscript form, this provision indicates no more than that the property definitions in that form will be amended to reflect the property boundaries as ultimately agreed in the Silverstein Parties' contract with the Port Authority. It can not reasonably be read as an agreement that all of the terms of the WilProp form have been abandoned and the parties' obligations will be fixed solely by some future agreement.2 No reasonable fact finder could conclude that either Willis or Hartford believed that by signing the Willis binder Hartford was abandoning its insistence that it was binding itself only in conformity with the \"Manuscript Form Submitted\". Because that \"Manuscript Form\" was the WilProp form, Hartford's binder incorporated the WilProp definition of \"occurrence.\" 2. Royal Indemnity Company A. The Facts Royal Indemnity Company (\"Royal\") participated in the World Trade Center insurance placement through two distinct entities, Royal & Sun Alliance Risk Management and Global Division (\"RMG\") in New York, and Royal Specialty Underwriting, Inc. (\"RSI\") in Atlanta.

Because that \"Manuscript Form\" was the WilProp form, Hartford's binder incorporated the WilProp definition of \"occurrence.\" 2. Royal Indemnity Company A. The Facts Royal Indemnity Company (\"Royal\") participated in the World Trade Center insurance placement through two distinct entities, Royal & Sun Alliance Risk Management and Global Division (\"RMG\") in New York, and Royal Specialty Underwriting, Inc. (\"RSI\") in Atlanta. While the Silverstein Parties would like to lump these two entities together, it is clear that the negotiations with each were completely separate, and that, prior to September 11th, there was no coordination of the two insurance placements by either the insureds or the insurers. Moreover, at this time, Royal is seeking summary judgment only as to RMG's liability. On June 14, 2001, Willis broker Timothy Boyd e-mailed RMG underwriter Michael Koenig, seeking his participation in the WTC properties insurance program. Boyd attached the WilProp policy form to this e-mail and wrote, \"We have included WilProp for Real Estate as a guideline form, although ultimate form must meet property definitions as contained in the contract with PA and Silverstein.\" On July 9th, RMG e-mailed and faxed an authorization to Boyd for $100,000,000 of insurance coverage. The fax cover sheet stated: \"Tim, Attached please find our authorization for the above risk...I have included some form changes that we would be looking for; however, this authorization would be subject to review and acceptance of the finalized manuscript form.\" The authorization also stated that it was \"subject to review and acceptance of the finalized form being used by the primary insurers.\" Under the heading \"Policy Form,\" the authorization stated, \"Willis manuscript policy form as submitted except for the changes noted in the addendum to this quote. Final policy form wording is to be determined subject to review and acceptance of the final primary policy form wording.\" Under the heading, \"Covered Perils,\" Koenig wrote: \"as per the Willis manuscript policy form with the changes described below. Subject to review and acceptance of the primary manuscript form.\" Under the heading \"Exclusions,\" Koenig wrote that coverage was offered \"[a]s per manuscript form.\" Koenig specifically deleted the second paragraph of WilProp's Clause D, titled \"Participation,\" which read: \"The ___ Insurance Company is the designated Lead Underwriter and by signature hereto, this Insurer agrees to abide by and accept decisions of the Lead Underwriter with respect to underwriting, policy administration, and claims settlement.\" Koenig also deleted a clause that indicated that the insurer was the \"author\" of the form. Koenig wrote \"subject to review and acceptance of the finalized manuscript form\" on each page of the July 9, 2001 Authorization. Sometime after he received the July 9, 2001 Authorization, Boyd asked RMG to provide Willis with premium quotes and confirm authorization for Royal's participation in alternative layers of the WTC insurance program.

Koenig wrote \"subject to review and acceptance of the finalized manuscript form\" on each page of the July 9, 2001 Authorization. Sometime after he received the July 9, 2001 Authorization, Boyd asked RMG to provide Willis with premium quotes and confirm authorization for Royal's participation in alternative layers of the WTC insurance program. In response, Koenig revised his offer, authorizing participation in two alternative layers. Koenig's revised authorization stated that \"all other terms and conditions would remain as per [RMG's] original authorization.\" On July 17th, Boyd e-mailed Koenig to bind Royal's participation pursuant to RMG's authorization to provide $50,404,557 of coverage, as part of the ninth layer of the insurance program ($933 million total, attaching in the event of a loss exceeding $1.5 billion). On July 19th, Koenig returned Boyd's e-mail and provided Willis with RMG's policy number for the coverage. Around this time, Koenig and Boyd had a telephone conversation. Koenig's written notes of this telephone conversation stated: \"Per discussion with Tim Boyd of Willis, terms and conditions of policy are likely to change, becoming more restrictive as form continues to be negotiated with the primary carriers. End result will most likely be a modified version of the Travelers Policy form. I told Tim that we would bind subject to the policy form changes and coverage terms per our authorization (with the exception of the revised layer). Tim agreed and told me that this binder was a formality, and it will be revised in our favor once the primary policy form is finalized.\" There is a dispute between the parties as to whether this conversation occurred before or after Boyd e-mailed the binder to Koenig. The Willis binder sent by Boyd did not reference either the Travelers form or the WilProp form. Like the binder sent to Hartford, it contained the words \"And as incorporated into the manuscript form, in conjunction with the contract between the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey as ultimately agreed,\" under the heading \"Property and time Element Covered.\" Koenig faxed the signed binder back to Boyd with his handwritten modifications. Koenig added to the \"General Conditions\" section of the binder that Royal's coverage is \"subject to form revisions as described in our authorization.\" In addition, Koenig added \"Bound As Amended and per our authorization\" above his signature on the last page of the July 20, 2001 binder. Finally, the cover note to Koenig's fax stated, \"As discussed, I have made some corrections to the binder in order to make it in accordance with the terms we authorized.\" On August 22, 2001, Willis paid the premium invoice for RMG's coverage. On August 29th, Boyd informed Koenig that a finalized Travelers form would be forthcoming.

Finally, the cover note to Koenig's fax stated, \"As discussed, I have made some corrections to the binder in order to make it in accordance with the terms we authorized.\" On August 22, 2001, Willis paid the premium invoice for RMG's coverage. On August 29th, Boyd informed Koenig that a finalized Travelers form would be forthcoming. Meanwhile, as Koenig was negotiating with Boyd on behalf of RMG, another Silverstein broker was separately negotiating with RSI. After September 11th, there were discussions at the upper management level of RMG's parent, regarding the adoption of a consistent position that would minimize the exposure of the two Royal entities. On October 15, 2001, Boyd e-mailed Koenig a proposed excess-layer insurance policy form, stating that its final language was being negotiated. Boyd also attached a copy of the primary Travelers policy to this e-mail, asking Koenig to see whether RMG would issue the Travelers policy form as its own policy, as RSI had done. According to Boyd, Koenig responded that he was prepared to sign and return the form. However, a contemporaneous e-mail from Koenig to others at Royal indicates that during this conversation Koenig reminded Boyd that \"we quoted and bound coverage on the Willis form.\" In any event, after Koenig forwarded the policy on for review, a senior Royal executive told Koenig to \"hold your binder position\" and await \"a course of action.\" B. Discussion It is hard to imagine a case in which it could be more certain that an insurer's binder was based on the WilProp form than that of RMG. The original July 9th authorization that Koenig sent to Boyd stated under the heading \"Policy Form,\" \"Willis manuscript policy form as submitted except for the changes noted in the addendum to this quote. Final policy form wording is to be determined subject to review and acceptance of the final primary policy form wording.\" The binder that Koenig signed and faxed to Boyd on July 20th, stated just above Koenig's signature, \"Bound As Amended and per our authorization.\" No amount of expert testimony or post-event testimony of interested parties can change the clear import of the words Koenig used.3 RMG's binder specifically incorporated the WilProp form as submitted, including its definition of the term \"occurrence\". While there is ample evidence that RMG did not like all of the provisions of the WilProp form, and that it was aware that as an excess carrier it would have little leverage to change the terms ultimately agreed to by the primary carriers, that is not relevant. As noted above, a binder is \"a short method of issuing a temporary policy for the convenience of all parties, to continue until the execution of the formal one.\" Lipman v. Niagara Fire Ins. Co., 121 N.Y. 454, 458 (1890)(emphasis added).", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:020925newsday.txt:10:a0decbd168dc", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 7118, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "020925newsday.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "020925newsday", "chunk_index": 11, "text": "like all of the provisions of the WilProp form, and that it was aware that as an excess carrier it would have little leverage to change the terms ultimately agreed to by the primary carriers, that is not relevant.

Co., 121 N.Y. 454, 458 (1890)(emphasis added). Until a formal policy issued, the terms that Koening incorporated into the binder controlled. Indeed, that is exactly what Koenig insisted upon when he stated in his authorization, \"Final policy form wording is to be determined subject to review and acceptance of the final primary policy form wording.\" Until that wording was reviewed and accepted, both Royal and its insured were required to look to the binder to determine the extent of the insurer's per \"occurrence\" liability. 3. St. Paul Fire & Marine Insurance Company A. The Facts In early July 2001, Stewart Smith broker Harold Tucker contacted Carol Springett-King, a St. Paul underwriter, about the possibility of St. Paul participating in the WTC insurance program. On July 3, 2001, Tucker e-mailed Springett-King a copy of property insurance specifications for the Silverstein program, which included a schedule of values for each of the properties to be insured and a ten year loss summary. On July 9th, Tucker provided Springett-King with a copy of the WilProp form marked \"DRAFT,\" as well as a risk assessment report. The form did not identify a particular company as the lead underwriter in the space allotted for such identification. Tucker did not identify the lead underwriter to Springett-King. On July 11th, Springett-King informed Tucker by phone of St. Paul's quote for its participation in the WTC program. Tucker's notes of the discussion read: \"St. Paul p/o 250 x 250 @1500/mil $375,000.\" On July 18th, Tucker sent Springett-King an e-mail stating: \"Bind effective 7/19/01 to 7/19/02 $30,000,000 p/o $250,000,000 xs $250,000,000 All Risk Including Flood and Earthquake @ $425,000 100% or $51,000 for your 12% share. Please confirm coverage bound with an assigned policy number by return e-mail. We need policy numbers for the closing tomorrow.\" Springett-King replied by e-mail, stating: \"The policy number is 144SP0922. I will send formal binder shortly.\" St. Paul never issued a binder. Springett-King testified, during her deposition, that by sending the policy number she was \"confirming coverage.\" On July 23, 2001, Michelle Smith, a Senior Technical Assistant at Stewart Smith, sent Springett-King a copy of the Confirmation of Insurance. Smith's letter asked Springett-King to review the Confirmation and advise it if it did not agree with her records. The letter also read: \"We look forward to receiving the policy [from St. Paul] in due course.\" The Confirmation stated that Stewart Smith had \"procured insurance subject to all terms and conditions", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:020925newsday.txt:11:e6d072c74a2e", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 7119, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "020925newsday.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "020925newsday", "chunk_index": 12, "text": "the policy number she was \"confirming coverage.\" On July 23, 2001, Michelle Smith, a Senior Technical Assistant at Stewart Smith, sent Springett-King a copy of the Confirmation of Insurance. Smith's letter asked Springett-King to review the Confirmation and advise it if it did not agree with her records. The letter also read: \"We look forward to receiving the policy [from St. Paul] in due course.\" The Confirmation stated that Stewart Smith had \"procured insurance subject to all terms and conditions herein stated, from the Insurer listed below.\" It identified the policy as \"Manuscript Form to be agreed.\" The Confirmation did not identify any lead underwriter and did not state that St. Paul would be required to follow the form of another insurer. Although the Confirmation set forth the terms and conditions of St. Paul's coverage, it was bereft of key terms, including the fact that 1 World Trade Center LLC, 2 World Trade Center LLC, 4 World Trade Center LLC and 5 World Trade Center LLC were among the insureds. On August 1, 2001, Oscar Aguilar of St. Paul sent Tucker an invoice which was thereafter paid. An internal St. Paul document shows that as of this date, St. Paul had written $30 million in coverage on the Silverstein program. The \"Policy Form and Conditions\" section of the internal document was blank. There is no evidence that St. Paul was informed of Travelers participation in the World Trade Center insurance program at any time prior to September 11th. On September 11, 2001, Springett-King called Kevin Nash, Senior Vice President of her division, and informed him that St. Paul had participated in the WTC insurance program. She also told Charles Loud, the St. Paul claims adjuster on the WTC insurance program, that St. Paul had participated in that program. On September 14th, St. Paul submitted a notice of loss to its reinsurer, stating that it would be required to pay the entire position of $30 million on the WTC insurance policy and thus would be entitled to $24 million from the reinsurer. On September 17th, Tucker sent an e-mail to Springett-King stating that \"the lead as far as the policy form is concerned is Travelers\" and that he \"should have the excess form and a copy of the primary for you shortly.\" Springett-King forwarded the e-mail to Loud. In an entry for this date, Loud's computer journal reads: \"received E-Mail [from Carol] and Travelers is the lead and will issue a policy this week from what she understands.\" The journal also indicates that Springett-King told Loud that day that \"Travelers is going to issue the policy...\" On September 18th, Loud sent a \"Property Large Loss Report\" to St. Paul's home office which read: \"Coverage--Forms and Issues: We have yet to receive a copy of the policy. The form is going to be issued from Travelers Insurance Company...\" On October 3rd, Springett-King", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:020925newsday.txt:12:50fce96da565", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 7120, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "020925newsday.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "020925newsday", "chunk_index": 13, "text": "Carol] and Travelers is the lead and will issue a policy this week from what she understands.\" The journal also indicates that Springett-King told Loud that day that \"Travelers is going to issue the policy...\" On September 18th, Loud sent a \"Property Large Loss Report\" to St. Paul's home office which read: \"Coverage--Forms and Issues: We have yet to receive a copy of the policy. The form is going to be issued from Travelers Insurance Company...\" On October 3rd, Springett-King e-mailed Tom Cesare of Stewart Smith, saying \"We do not have a copy of endorsement 1. Please fax a copy. Thanks.\" Stewart Smith sent a complete copy of the Travelers policy, to which a St. Paul employee affixed a note saying \"final form 10/4/2001.\" To this, Springett-King added, \"All Endorsements Included.\" B. Discussion If the Court was empowered to impose \"its own conception of what the parties should or might have undertaken, rather than confining itself to the implementation of a bargain to which they have mutually committed themselves,\" Martin Delicatessen v. Schumacher, 52 N.Y.2d at 109, 436 N.Y.S.2d at 249, St. Paul's motion for summary judgment would be denied.4 Apparently Springett-King did not even review the WilProp form before issuing St. Paul's binder. However, a party who accepts a written offer of a contract without reading it can not be heard to claim that it is not bound by the terms of that offer. As Judge Carter of this Court observed recently in Hangzhou Silk Import & Export Corp. v. P.C.B. Intern. Industries, Inc., No. 00 Civ 6344, 2002 WL 2031591, at *6 (S.D.N.Y. Sept. 5, 2002): [A party to a contract] will not now be heard to attempt to avoid the contract by claiming ignorance of its provisions. Ignorance of the terms and conditions of a contract is no defense for a party that has already executed the contract. \"A party who signs a document without any valid excuse for having failed to read it is 'conclusively bound' by its terms.\" Sofio v. Hughes, 556 N.Y.S.2d 717, 718-19 (2nd Dep't 1990) (quoting Gillman v. Chase Manhattan Bank, 537 N.Y.S.2d 787, 792 (1988)). Here Willis submitted an offer to purchase insurance from St. Paul, which included a draft of the WilProp form. That offer was accepted when Springett-King sent Willis the St. Paul policy number confirming coverage. As of the point at which the binder became final, no form other than the WilProp form had been before the parties. There can be no question that, if the Silverstein Parties were asserting that St. Paul bound itself to the WilProp form, St. Paul would have no defense. Since \"[m]utuality is the essence of a contract,\" Hauck Food Products Corp. v. E.A. Stevenson & Co., 203 A.D. 308, 312, 197 N.Y.S. 34, 37 (3rd Dep't 1922)(Hinman, J., concurring), both the Silverstein Parties and St. Paul must be bound to the same", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:020925newsday.txt:13:75d1ed808c13", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 7121, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "020925newsday.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "020925newsday", "chunk_index": 14, "text": "other than the WilProp form had been before the parties. There can be no question that, if the Silverstein Parties were asserting that St. Paul bound itself to the WilProp form, St. Paul would have no defense. Since \"[m]utuality is the essence of a contract,\" Hauck Food Products Corp. v. E.A. Stevenson & Co., 203 A.D. 308, 312, 197 N.Y.S. 34, 37 (3rd Dep't 1922)(Hinman, J., concurring), both the Silverstein Parties and St. Paul must be bound to the same terms. \"Unless both parties to a contract are bound, so that either can sue the other for a breach, neither is bound.\" Oscar Schlegel Mfg. Co. v. Peter Cooper's Glue Factory, 231 N.Y. 459, 462 (1921); Riccardi v. Silver Linen Supply Co., Inc., 45 A.D.2d 191, 193, 356 N.Y.S.2d 872, 875 (1st Dep't 1974), aff'd 36 N.Y.S.2d 945 (1975); Supreme Lodge K. P. v. Withers, 177 U.S. 260, 269, 20 S. Ct. 611, 615 (1900)(\"[I]f the insured is to be now bound as having thus contracted, there must be mutuality in the contract.\"). The WilProp form was the only mutually binding form that was before the parties at the time the binder became effective. The Silverstein Parties argue that since the confirmation of binder sent to St. Paul identified the policy as \"Manuscript Form to be agreed,\" St. Paul agreed to accept whatever form was ultimately agreed upon. However, such a reading would have made the binder an unenforceable agreement to agree. R.G. Group, Inc. v. Horn & Hardart Co., 751 F.2d 69, 74 (2d Cir. 1984) (\"Under New York law, if parties do not intend to be bound by an agreement until it is in writing and signed, then there is no contract until that event occurs.\"). As noted above, a binder is not an agreement to agree to terms in the future. A binder is \"a short method of issuing a temporary policy for the convenience of all parties, to continue until the execution of the formal one.\" Lipman v. Niagara Fire Ins. Co., 121 N.Y. 454, 458 (1890). As of September 11, 2001, no formal contract of insurance had been executed or even completely agreed upon, and St. Paul had not even been told of Travelers' participation in the World Trade Center insurance program. Thus, the terms of the insurance agreement between St. Paul and the Silverstein Parties on September 11th can only be derived from the form that was before the parties at the time the binder was issued. This was the WilProp form. It is of no consequence that this form now favors St. Paul, which did not read it, over the Silverstein Parties, who proposed it as a draft. Each of these parties is bound to the definition of \"occurrence\" that is set forth therein. II. THE WILPROP DEFINITION OF \"OCCURRENCE\" The WilProp form contained the following definition of the term \"occurrence\": \"Occurrence\" shall", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:020925newsday.txt:14:1c9e0ded7a96", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 7122, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "020925newsday.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "020925newsday", "chunk_index": 15, "text": "form that was before the parties at the time the binder was issued.

Each of these parties is bound to the definition of \"occurrence\" that is set forth therein. II. THE WILPROP DEFINITION OF \"OCCURRENCE\" The WilProp form contained the following definition of the term \"occurrence\": \"Occurrence\" shall mean all losses or damages that are attributable directly or indirectly to one cause or to one series of similar causes. All such losses will be added together and the total amount of such losses will be treated as one occurrence irrespective of the period of time or area over which such losses occur. The insurers argue that where one of the Twin Towers was struck by a hijacked airplane at 8:46 a.m. on September 11th, and 16 minutes later, the second tower was hit by a second hijacked plane, there can be no reasonable dispute that the Silverstein Parties' losses were the result of \"one series of similar causes.\" The Silverstein Parties limit their response to this argument to a footnote in which they quote a professor's argument that this language could be construed so that two planes hitting the two towers in a sixteen minute period would not constitute one series of similar causes. This half-hearted attempt to dispute the plain meaning of the WilProp definition of \"occurrence\" can not defeat the insurers' right to summary judgment on this issue. Under New York law, the terms of an insurance policy are interpreted from the vantage point of the \"average person on the street.'\" Nat'l Screen Serv. Corp. v. United States Fidelity & Guaranty Co., 364 F.2d 275, 278 (2d Cir.), cert. denied, 385 U.S. 958 (1966). When interpreting a \"specialized business policy,\" however, \"the average person is not the housewife purchasing flight insurance but the average purchaser of broad business liability insurance...\" Id. \"[C]omplex comprehensive general liability policies issued to large corporate manufacturers . . . should be viewed as if by a reasonably intelligent business person who is familiar with the agreement and with the industry in question. Normally the court can put itself in this position, so that expert evidence need not be submitted.\" Uniroyal, Inc. v. Home Ins. Co., 707 F. Supp. 1368, 1377-8 (E.D.N.Y. 1988). See also K.

While an academic may be able to come up with a strained meaning for the definition of \"occurrence\" in the WilProp Form, \"common speech' and the reasonable expectation and purpose of the ordinary businessman'\" can not. The ordinary businessman would have no doubt that when two hijacked planes hit the Twin Towers in a sixteen minute period, the total destruction of the World Trade Center resulted from \"one series of similar causes.\" Indeed, this reasonable reading of the WilProp definition of the term \"occurrence\" apparently caused the Silverstein Parties to accept a payment of one policy limit in full satisfaction of the liability of at least two insurers who indisputably issued binders on the basis of the WilProp form. CONCLUSION Since the Court has determined that each of the three insurers whose motions are addressed herein bound themselves on the basis of the WilProp form, and that the definition of \"occurrence\" contained in that form is susceptible of only one reasonable reading, each of them is entitled to summary judgment that it is liable to the Silverstein Parties for only one payment in the face amount of its policy.

Data on Informer; F.B.I. Resists **By JAMES RISEN** WASHINGTON, Oct. 5 - The Federal Bureau of Investigation had a confidential informer who rented rooms in California to two of the Sept. 11 hijackers, but the bureau is resisting a request from the Congressional committee investigating the attacks to interview the informer and his F.B.I. handler, government officials said. The joint Sept. 11 Congressional committee plans to hold a closed hearing on Wednesday focusing on the F.B.I.'s handling of its San Diego informer, who was the landlord of the hijackers Khalid al-Midhar and Nawaq Alhazmi a year before the attacks. Several officials said the F.B.I. had rebuffed requests to make the informer available to the committee and would not authorize the agent who was his contact to testify. The F.B.I.'s resistance has led Congressional officials to become more aggressive in trying to find out whether the informer provided clues about the hijackers that the bureau ignored or failed to act on before Sept. 11. An F.B.I. official said the bureau had provided the committee with all the agent's reports on the informer's activities. The official said the F.B.I. was unwilling to allow the informer to testify on principle, fearing it could damage efforts to recruit sources from Arab-American communities. The official said the F.B.I. had not learned the identity of Mr. Midhar or Mr. Alhazmi from the informer, who was known as a \"passive source,\" meaning he was not assigned to obtain specific intelligence but routinely passed on information. The official said the F.B.I. did not have any information indicating that the informer knew anything about the plot or had passed on any details that should have caused his F.B.I. contact to focus more closely on Mr. Midhar or Mr. Alhazmi. **But Congressional investigators say the F.B.I.'s efforts to block their inquiry makes them skeptical of the bureau's assertions about the informer. They also say", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:021005nytimes.txt:0:a916f11ad099", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 7126, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "021005nytimes.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "021005nytimes", "chunk_index": 1, "text": "meaning he was not assigned to obtain specific intelligence but routinely passed on information. The official said the F.B.I. did not have any information indicating that the informer knew anything about the plot or had passed on any details that should have caused his F.B.I. contact to focus more closely on Mr. Midhar or Mr. Alhazmi. **But Congressional investigators say the F.B.I.'s efforts to block their inquiry makes them skeptical of the bureau's assertions about the informer. They also say the Justice Department has joined the F.B.I. in fighting the Congressional requests for information related to the matter, escalating tensions. ** The fight over access to the informer is the latest bitter dispute between the committee and the Bush administration and the intelligence and law enforcement agencies that are the subject of the committee's investigation. **Antagonism between the Central Intelligence Agency and the committee became public a week ago** after the director of central intelligence, George J. Tenet, wrote a letter to the committee's leaders, protesting the treatment of a senior C.I.A. officer who had testified about the agency's record on fighting terrorism. Mr. Tenet's letter was in response to a disclosure that the committee's staff had written briefing papers predicting to committee members that Cofer Black, who was until recently the chief of the C.I.A.'s counterterrorism center, would \"dissemble\" in his testimony. Separately, documents made public in federal court in Alexandria, Va., late last month showed that the Justice Department sought unsuccessfully to prevent F.B.I. agents, and the bureau's director, Robert S. Mueller III, from testifying publicly before the joint inquiry. Justice Department lawyers asked the judge presiding in the case of Zacarias Moussaoui, who faces a trial on conspiracy charges related to the Sept. 11 attacks, to rule that Congressional testimony from agents and Mr. Mueller to the committee would imperil Mr. Moussaoui's trial. Lawyers for the Congressional committee responded in court filings of their own, saying that the Justice Department was seeking an order that they could use to tell F.B.I. witnesses not to respond to questions about the bureau's handling of the Moussaoui case. The role of the F.B.I.'s San Diego informer has become important to the Congressional committee because he is linked to the two hijackers who have come under the most intense scrutiny in the joint inquiry. Mr. Midhar and Mr. Alhazmi, who were among the hijackers on the American Airlines plane that crashed into the Pentagon, were identified as Qaeda operatives by the C.I.A. in January 2001.

The GAO added that more than a year after the attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon, the State Department still does not adequately train consular officials and has yet to establish clear guidelines on reviewing visa applications. Attempts to change have been hobbled by a dispute between the State and Justice departments, which disagree about the evidence required to bar suspected terrorists from the United States, according to the report. \"Weaknesses remain in visa policies and procedures that limit the effectiveness of the visa process as an antiterrorism tool,\" the study concluded. State Department spokesman Richard Boucher declined to comment yesterday on specifics of the report because department officials had not seen it. \"We look forward to any suggestions the General Accounting Office has about how we can improve and strengthen the visa process, something we've been trying to do since September 11th,\" Boucher said. Boucher said ensuring that applications were properly filled out \"was one of the things that should have been done that wasn't done.\" The findings by GAO, the nonpartisan investigative arm of Congress, represent the latest evidence of problems within the State Department's visa program, which has been criticized as lax and focused on diplomatic concerns. Earlier this year, the chief of the department's Bureau of Consular Affairs was fired, and a program permitting travel agents in Saudi Arabia to forward visa applications was scrapped. State Department officials said previously that 12 of the Sept. 11 hijackers from Saudi Arabia had been interviewed by consular officials, and that the others probably would not have been denied if they had", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:021022post_9-11_hijackers_visas.txt:0:e85fc3285216", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 7129, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "021022post_9-11_hijackers_visas.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "021022post_9-11_hijackers_visas", "chunk_index": 1, "text": "within the State Department's visa program, which has been criticized as lax and focused on diplomatic concerns.

State Department officials said previously that 12 of the Sept. 11 hijackers from Saudi Arabia had been interviewed by consular officials, and that the others probably would not have been denied if they had been interviewed. None of the hijackers' names was included on a terrorist watch list before their entry into the United States. The GAO report found that all 15 of the hijackers from Saudi Arabia applied for visas in Jeddah or Riyadh; two others applied in their native United Arab Emirates. The remaining two, including ringleader Mohamed Atta, an Egyptian citizen, applied as \"third-country\" applicants in Berlin. **None of 18 separate visa applications by 15 of the hijackers was completed properly, the report said. Thirteen of the 15, who were from Saudi Arabia or UAE, were never interviewed before being approved for a visa, the report found. Investigators were unable to review the applications for four other hijackers, including Atta, because they were destroyed. ** The GAO report provides a revealing glimpse into a continuing feud between officials at State and Justice over visa policy. Robert F. Diegelman, an acting assistant attorney general, told GAO investigators in a letter that the State Department believes that an applicant must be granted a visa unless there is \"specific evidence of activities or associations\" linking the applicant to terrorists, and that placement on a terrorist tracking list alone is insufficient. Justice officials say U.S. law \"places the burden of proof on the applicant to establish his admissibility,\" Diegelman wrote. © 2002 The Washington Post Company FAIR USE NOTICE: This site contains copyrighted material the use of which has not always been specifically authorized by the copyright owner.

Paper Work Let Sept. 11 Hijackers Into the U.S.** *By [Martha Raddatz](http://abcnews.go.com/sections/wnt/WorldNewsTonight/raddatz_martha_bio.htlm)* ABCNews.com Oct. 23 - A new report accuses the State Department of staggering lapses in its visa program that gave Sept. 11 hijackers entry into the United States. The political journal *National Review* obtained the visa applications for 15 of the 19 hijackers - and evidence that all of them should have been denied entry to the country. Almost all of the hijacker's visas were issued in Saudi Arabia, at the U.S. Embassy in Riyadh or the U.S. Consulate in Jedda. Terrorist ties aside, the applications themselves should have raised red flags, say experts. The forms are incomplete and often incomprehensible - yet that didn't stop any of the 15 terrorists for whom the visa applications were obtained from coming to the United States. The only alleged would-be hijacker who failed to get a visa was Ramzi Binalshibh, who was denied entrance to the United States repeatedly. \"This is a systemic problem,\" said Nikolai Wenzel, a former U.S. consular officer. \"It's a problem of sloppiness, it's a problem of negligence which I would call criminal negligence because obviously, having reviewed all these applications, there is a pattern here.\" The pattern? None of the 15 applications reviewed was filled out properly. Brothers Wail and Waleed al Shehri applied together in October 2000. Under \"occupation\" Wail wrote \"teater;\" brother Waleed claimed \"student.\" The name and address of alleged employer and school was listed as \"South City,\" and the questionable U.S. destination named as \"Wasantwn.\" Visas approved. Abdulaziz Alomari claimed to be a student but didn't name a school; claimed to be married but didn't name a spouse; under nationality and gender, he didn't list anything. Visa approved. Three months later, Alomari followed his friend Mohamed Atta through airport security ... heading for the World Trade Center. Khalid Al Mihdhar, who helped crash the plane into the Pentagon, simply", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:021023abc.txt:0:fb9b6be67d7f", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 7132, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "021023abc.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "021023abc", "chunk_index": 1, "text": "employer and school was listed as \"South City,\" and the questionable U.S. destination named as \"Wasantwn.\" Visas approved.

Three months later, Alomari followed his friend Mohamed Atta through airport security ... heading for the World Trade Center. Khalid Al Mihdhar, who helped crash the plane into the Pentagon, simply listed \"Hotel\" as his U.S. destination - no name, no city, no state - but no problem getting a visa. Just One Had a Slight Delay Hani Hanjour, who also was on the plane that hit the Pentagon, had only a slight delay in acquiring his visa. A consulate employee flagged Hanjour's first application, noting that Hanjour wanted to \"visit\" for three years, although the legal limit is two. When Hanjour returned two weeks later, he simply changed the form to read \"one year\". Visa approved. \"They were handing these things out gift-wrapped with ribbons on top,\" said Joel Mowbray, contributing editor of the *National Review*. Mowbray, who obtained the visas, said he was shocked by what he saw. \"I mean, I really was expecting al Qaeda to have trained their operatives well, to beat the system,\" he said. \"They didn't have to beat the system, the system was rigged in their favor from the get-go.\" The State Department insists that employees did nothing wrong - that the questions raised about the applications amount to Monday morning quarterbacking, and that extensive screening procedures have now been implemented to improve the process.

Arkin; **Abstract:** The development of the Pentagon's covert counter-terror capability has its roots in the 1979 Iran hostage crisis. The Army created a highly compartmentalized organization that could collect clandestine intelligence independent of the rest of the U.S. intelligence community and follow through with covert military action. Meantime, old commands are being morphed into new ones for the covert war. The two Joint Interagency Task Forces in the United States previously devoted to fighting drugs now have the war on terrorism as their highest priority. The epicenter of the Pentagon's covert operations remains the North Carolina-based Joint Special Operations Command, often referred to as Delta Force. The super-secret command is still not officially acknowledged to exist. Its two-star commander, Army Maj. Gen. Dell L. Dailey, who spent much of the Afghan war in Oman, has no public biography. **Full Text:** SOUTH POMFRET, Vt. -- In what may well be the largest expansion of covert action by the armed forces since the Vietnam era, the Bush administration has turned to what the Pentagon calls the \"black world\" to press the war on terrorism and weapons of mass destruction. The Defense Department is building up an elite secret army with resources stretching across the full spectrum of covert capabilities. New organizations are being created. The missions of existing units are being revised. Spy planes and ships are being assigned new missions in anti-terror and monitoring the \"axis of evil.\" The increasingly dominant role of the military, Pentagon officials say, reflects frustration at the highest levels of government with the performance of the intelligence community, law enforcement agencies and much of the burgeoning homeland security apparatus. It also reflects the desire of Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld to gain greater overall control of the war on terror. Insulated from outside pressures, armed with matchless weapons and technology, trained to operate below the shadow line, the Pentagon's black world of classified operations holds out the hope of swift, decisive action in a", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:021027latimes.txt:0:f2f1ba813179", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 7135, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "021027latimes.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "021027latimes", "chunk_index": 1, "text": "frustration at the highest levels of government with the performance of the intelligence community, law enforcement agencies and much of the burgeoning homeland security apparatus. It also reflects the desire of Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld to gain greater overall control of the war on terror. Insulated from outside pressures, armed with matchless weapons and technology, trained to operate below the shadow line, the Pentagon's black world of classified operations holds out the hope of swift, decisive action in a struggle against terrorism that often looks more like a family feud than a war. Coupled with the enormous effort being made throughout the government to improve and link information networks and databases, covert anti-terror operations promise to put better information in the hands of streamlined military teams that can identify, monitor and neutralize terrorist threats. \"Prevention and preemption are ... the only defense against terrorism,\" Rumsfeld said in May. \"Our task is to find and destroy the enemy before they strike us.\" The new apparatus for covert operations and the growing government secrecy associated with the war on terrorism reflect the way the Bush administration's most senior officials see today's world: First, they see fighting terrorism and its challenge to U.S. interests and values as the 21st century equivalent of the Cold War crusade against communism. Second, they believe the magnitude of the threat requires, and thus justifies, aggressive new \"off-the-books\" tactics. In their understandable frustration over continued atrocities such as the recent Bali attack, however, U.S. officials might keep two points in mind. Though covert action can bring quick results, because it is isolated from the normal review processes it can just as quickly bring mistakes and larger problems. Also, the Pentagon is every bit as capable as the civilian side of the government when it comes to creating organization charts and bureaucracy that stifle creative thinking and timely action. The development of the Pentagon's covert counter-terror capability has its roots in the 1979 Iran hostage crisis. The Army created a highly compartmentalized organization that could collect clandestine intelligence independent of the rest of the U.S. intelligence community and follow through with covert military action. Known as the Intelligence Support Activity, or ISA, when it was established in 1981, this unit fought in drug wars and counter- terror operations from the Middle East to South America. It built a reputation for daring, flexibility and a degree of lawlessness. In May 1982, Deputy Secretary of Defense Frank Carlucci called the ISA \"uncoordinated and uncontrolled.\" Though its freelance tendencies were curbed, the ISA continued to operate under different guises through the ill-starred U.S. involvement in Somalia in 1992 and was reportedly active in the hunt for Bosnian Serbs suspected of war crimes. Today, the ISA operates under the code name Gray Fox. In addition to covert operations, it provides the war on terrorism with the kind of so-called \"close-in\" signals monitoring", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:021027latimes.txt:1:edd302d3bada", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 7136, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "021027latimes.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "021027latimes", "chunk_index": 2, "text": "May 1982, Deputy Secretary of Defense Frank Carlucci called the ISA \"uncoordinated and uncontrolled.\" Though its freelance tendencies were curbed, the ISA continued to operate under different guises through the ill-starred U.S. involvement in Somalia in 1992 and was reportedly active in the hunt for Bosnian Serbs suspected of war crimes. Today, the ISA operates under the code name Gray Fox. In addition to covert operations, it provides the war on terrorism with the kind of so-called \"close-in\" signals monitoring -- including the interception of cell phone conversations -- that helped bring down Colombian drug lord Pablo Escobar. Gray Fox's low-profile eavesdropping planes also fly without military markings. Working closely with Special Forces and the CIA, Gray Fox also places operatives inside hostile territory. In and around Afghanistan, Gray Fox was part of a secret sphere that included the CIA's paramilitary Special Activities Division and the Pentagon's Joint Special Operations Command. These commands and \"white\" Special Forces like the Green Berets, as well as Air Force combat controllers and commandos of eight different nations report to a mind-boggling array of new command cells and coordination units set up after Sept. 11. An Army brigadier general commands the Joint Interagency Task Force at Bagram air base north of Kabul to coordinate CIA, Defense Department and coalition forces in Afghanistan. A new Campaign Support Group has been established at Ft. Bragg, N.C. The Special Operations Joint Interagency Collaboration Center has been created in Tampa, Fla. In Europe, the Joint Interagency Coordination Group handles information-sharing and logistical support with NATO. Hawaii's Pacific Command stood up a Joint Interagency Counter-Terrorist Group this summer. Meantime, old commands are being morphed into new ones for the covert war. The two Joint Interagency Task Forces in the United States previously devoted to fighting drugs now have the war on terrorism as their highest priority. The epicenter of the Pentagon's covert operations remains the North Carolina-based Joint Special Operations Command, often referred to as Delta Force. The super-secret command is still not officially acknowledged to exist. Its two-star commander, Army Maj. Gen. Dell L. Dailey, who spent much of the Afghan war in Oman, has no public biography. Among Dailey's assets is a fleet of aircraft specially equipped for secret operations -- conventional and covert military planes and helicopters, and even former Soviet helicopters. The bulk of those craft, including the reconfigured Russian choppers, fly from airfields in Uzbekistan and from two Pakistani air bases, Shahbaz and Shamsi. The Air Force and the CIA collect additional intelligence from unmanned Predator and Global Hawk drones. They also have low- profile reconnaissance assets that look like transport planes and operate under such code names as ARL-Low, Keen Sage, Scathe View and Senior Scout. Not to be left out, the Navy's Gray Star spy vessel, reminiscent of the old Pueblo, captured by North Korea in 1968, now sweeps up sophisticated --", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:021027latimes.txt:2:9d37f511b786", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 7137, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "021027latimes.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "021027latimes", "chunk_index": 3, "text": "Uzbekistan and from two Pakistani air bases, Shahbaz and Shamsi. The Air Force and the CIA collect additional intelligence from unmanned Predator and Global Hawk drones.

Not to be left out, the Navy's Gray Star spy vessel, reminiscent of the old Pueblo, captured by North Korea in 1968, now sweeps up sophisticated -- and obscure -- \"measurements and signatures intelligence\" to monitor the ballistic missile capabilities of Iraq, Iran and North Korea. Even with all this, the Pentagon wants to expand covert capabilities. Rumsfeld's influential Defense Science Board 2002 Summer Study on Special Operations and Joint Forces in Support of Countering Terrorism says in its classified \"outbrief\" -- a briefing drafted to guide other Pentagon agencies -- that the global war on terrorism \"requires new strategies, postures and organization.\" The board recommends creation of a super-Intelligence Support Activity, an organization it dubs the Proactive, Preemptive Operations Group, (P2OG), to bring together CIA and military covert action, information warfare, intelligence, and cover and deception. **Among other things, this body would launch secret operations aimed at \"stimulating reactions\" among terrorists and states possessing weapons of mass destruction -- that is, for instance, prodding terrorist cells into action and exposing themselves to \"quick-response\" attacks by U.S. forces. ** Such tactics would hold \"states/sub-state actors accountable\" and \"signal to harboring states that their sovereignty will be at risk,\" the briefing paper declares. Never to be outdone in proposing hardware solutions, the Air Force is designing its own Global Response Task Force to fight the war on terrorism. The all-seeing, all-bombing Air Force envisions unmanned A-X aircraft capable of long-range, nighttime gunship operations and an M-X covert transport, as well as hypersonic and space-based conventional weapons capable of delivering a \"worldwide attack within an hour.\" Who says the arms race is over? Rumsfeld's science board warns against overemphasis on equipment even as it recommends more. Washington is well on its way to an arms race with itself. And for those who worry that all these secret operations and aggressive new doctrines will turn the United States into the world's policeman, there is a ray of hope. Rumsfeld is now the field marshal of the war on terrorism, but the Pentagon is also creating new layers of bureaucracy that may save it from itself.

But thousands of bin Laden's trainees have long since moved on, and they have taught many more recruits worldwide. Can we find them in time? A NEWSWEEK investigation NEWSWEEK INTERNATIONAL Oct. 29 issue - He is a shadowy figure, lurking on the edges of the Sept. 11 attack. Federal investigators know that Omar al-Bayoumi helped pay the rent for two of the American Airlines Flight 77 hijackers, Nawaf Alhazmi and Khalid Almihdhar, on their apartment in San Diego. The Feds also know that al-Bayoumi is well educated and ambitious. IN COMPLETING AN APPLICATION for admission to a doctoral program at Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland, al-Bayoumi listed himself as \"assistant to the director of finance\" at Dallah AVCO, an aviation-services company based in Saudi Arabia. The FBI is investigating possible ties between Dallah AVCO and Al Qaeda terror network. Asked about these ties by NEWSWEEK, Dallah AVCO's owner, Saudi billionaire Saleh Abdullah Kamel, responded, \"This is not true at all.\" U.S. intelligence suspects that wealthy Saudis are funding Islamic extremist groups. Asked if he supported terrorist groups, Kamel replied, \"I am a real Muslim. Islam is the religion of peace.\" (Arrested but released by Scotland Yard, al-Bayoumi is now living in England, where he remains under investigation by U.S. and British authorities.) Just how rich and deep-and diabolical-is the global terror network of Al Qaeda? **Since Sept. 11, the FBI's manhunt has rounded up more than ** ** 800 people, but only 10 have been linked in any way to the hijackings-and ** ** those 10 are not talking. (Most of the suspects probably will turn out to ** be innocent.) Federal law-enforcement officials estimate that there are perhaps a thousand people in the United States who have ties to terrorist organizations abroad. With cells in at least 60 countries, Al Qaeda has thousands more awaiting orders to strike. Rooting them out is going to be exceedingly difficult. Clues are always clearer in hindsight. One FBI official noted, a little ruefully, that the bureau's Phoenix, Ariz., field office cabled headquarters last summer about an unusual number of Arabs who seemed to be taking flight lessons. \"But that was all they could tell us-Jeez, there are a lot of Arabs taking", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:021029newsweek.txt:0:cef4277247a7", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 7140, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "021029newsweek.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "021029newsweek", "chunk_index": 1, "text": "terrorist organizations abroad.

Actually, the Sept. 11 hijackers were not sleepers in the pure, cold-war sense: they were not passively waiting to be \"awakened\" by an order from their spymasters. With perhaps one exception (Hani Hanjour, who traveled in and out of the United States for almost 11 years), the hijackers came to the United States with a mission: to finish up their flying lessons and find a good target. Federal investigators tell NEWSWEEK that Mohamed Atta, the ringleader, visited Norfolk, Va., site of a huge U.S. Navy base, at least twice in February and April. The Feds believe that Atta was scoping out an aircraft carrier as a target. Most of the hijackers were slipped into the country last summer as muscle, to slit the throats of passengers. The more worrisome kind are like Atta: well educated, independent, patient, fanatical. Investigators do not know how many other Attas are out there. But they are beginning to have a better feel for the variety, cunning and determination of the terrorists who may in fact be living next door. American warplanes have flattened a half-dozen Al Qaeda terrorist-training camps in Afghanistan. But the camps were probably empty when the bombs fell, and their graduates-an estimated 20,000 men-have long since moved on. Many of them became cannon fodder for the endless Afghan civil war, but thousands have filtered out to dozens of countries around the world. The training camps are but one source of Al Qaeda's manpower. Indeed, only three or four of the 19 hijackers spent time in Al Qaeda camps. Long before Osama bin Laden began declaring fatwas on America, a diffuse network of Islamic terror was planting evil seeds in the United States. Bin Laden's brainy number two, Ayman al-Zawahiri, has been selling global jihad for over a decade. Al-Zawahiri is a kind of black prince of Islam. His paternal grandfather was the grand imam at Al-Azhar, the Harvard of the Sunni world, in the early 1900s. His father was a pharmacology professor at the University of Cairo. Young al-Zawahiri grew up in an upper-class neighborhood in Cairo; it may have been telling that as a young man at the Maadi Sporting Club, the shy, bespectacled al-Zawahiri \"liked to watch others play, rather", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:021029newsweek.txt:1:2e6d3bfd6bcd", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 7141, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "021029newsweek.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "021029newsweek", "chunk_index": 2, "text": "global jihad for over a decade. Al-Zawahiri is a kind of black prince of Islam. His paternal grandfather was the grand imam at Al-Azhar, the Harvard of the Sunni world, in the early 1900s. His father was a pharmacology professor at the University of Cairo. Young al-Zawahiri grew up in an upper-class neighborhood in Cairo; it may have been telling that as a young man at the Maadi Sporting Club, the shy, bespectacled al-Zawahiri \"liked to watch others play, rather than playing himself,\" recalled a former classmate. Al-Zawahiri was trained to be a surgeon. Yet rather than embrace modernity, he became an Islamic extremist, earning his stripes as a minor collaborator in the plot to assassinate Egypt's pro-Western President Anwar Sadat in 1981. Though sentenced to death in absentia by Egypt, al-Zawahiri appeared to move easily around the world, raising money in such seemingly benign settings as a mosque in Santa Clara, Calif. **WEEKEND TERRORISM TRAINING** Al-Zawahiri's terrorist organization, the brutal Egyptian Islamic Jihad, began planting agents in America almost two decades ago. When he moved to America from Egypt in 1984, Ali Mohamed was in such a hurry to assimilate that he married a woman he met on the plane. Incredibly, for a time in the late 1980s, Ali Mohamed served as an instructor to U.S. Special Forces at Fort Bragg, N.C.-while training future Islamic terrorists in Brooklyn, N.Y., and Jersey City, N.J., on the weekends. Mohamed later worked directly for Osama bin Laden on the 1998 bombings of the U.S. Embassies in Africa. Mohamed persuaded a friend, Khaled Dahab, to quit medical school in Cairo and move to California. There, Dahab drove a Volvo, joined Blockbuster, shopped at Sears-and allegedly handled logistics for terrorists. From his home in Santa Clara, he patched through calls for Egyptian Islamic Jihad members and transferred money around the globe. Al-Zawahiri called Dahab from time to time, once to price telephone-surveillance equipment. (Mohamed is now in a U.S. prison; Dahab, who claims he is innocent, is in jail in Egypt.) Virtually all the men detained for questioning by the FBI are from Middle Eastern ethnic groups. But anxious citizens who quietly countenance racial profiling to slow down Islamic terrorists may be in for a surprise. Al Qaeda is a rainbow coalition. Along with almost every other nationality, Al Qaeda training camps have attracted blond, blue-eyed Swedes and Germans. Lost youth of any race or nationality can be drawn to Islam's certainties. Once in the mosque, they can become bait for traveling imams preaching jihad. With its cultlike qualities, Al Qaeda has become a catchall for the disaffected. Consider the odyssey of David and Jerome Courtailler, born of solid French stock, sons of a butcher in the quiet town of Bonneville, nestled in the Alps near the Swiss border.

Consider the odyssey of David and Jerome Courtailler, born of solid French stock, sons of a butcher in the quiet town of Bonneville, nestled in the Alps near the Swiss border. The Courtailler boys were raised as Roman Catholics and avidly played soccer. But they started using drugs and felt trapped in a dead-end existence. \"I couldn't see a way out,\" David told Le Nouvel Observateur. Drifting to England looking for a job, David \"visited a mosque for the first time. It was impressive, all these people in the process of finding themselves. There was a serenity that showed on their faces.\" Both boys were recruited to go to Afghanistan. \"Going there was going to be great,\" said David. \"I had never traveled ... I was taken care of totally.\" They found out they were headed for terrorist-training camps only when they got there, David claims. \"I considered the training to be sort of military service,\" said David, though it grew \"tiresome,\" and David returned home to Bonneville. His brother Jerome took a different path: he is now in prison in the Netherlands as a prime suspect in an Al Qaeda plot to blow up the American Embassy in Paris last summer. **'PATIENCE, PRUDENCE, PRECISION'** Relative innocents can be swept up in the jihad. Dennis Justen is a 19-year-old blond, unemployed high-school grad from suburban Frankfurt. As a young teen, he surprised his parents by fasting for Ramadan, wearing a caftan, cutting off his girlfriend and hogging the family bathroom for hours-long \"ritual cleansing.\" The Justens were told by counselors that their son was \"just going through a phase.\" But on Sept. 22, Justen was caught trying to cross the border illegally from Afghanistan to Pakistan. Before flying home to Germany, he was interrogated by the FBI. Some Europeans join the jihad for more than spiritual relief and a chance to see the world. **Some very violent types have signed on, like Lionel Dumont, ** ** 29, described by the French press as \"the invisible Public Enemy No. 1.\" ** ** Growing up in a grimy industrial town in the north of France, he began ** ** attending a local mosque before doing his time in the French Army in ** ** Somalia, where he saw vast suffering by Muslims. He drifted to the Bosnian ** ** civil war, where he joined an extremist faction, called Takfir wal Hijra ** ** (Expiation and Exile), which is now seen as a core sect in the bin Laden ** ** network.

When they ** ** placed a car loaded with explosives and bottled-gas canisters in front of ** ** police headquarters in Lille on the eve of a G7 ministers' meeting in ** ** 1996, a violent shoot-out ensued.

Not only in Chechnya, but reaching as far as Moscow, New York ** ** and Washington, D.C.\" ** **PHYS-ED TRAINER IN MANCHESTER, ENGLAND** The various civil wars pitting Muslims against infidels around the world offer a perfect proving ground for jihad. A videotape obtained by the Russian intelligence service, the FSB, shows a muscular black man, speaking in perfect English, discussing how he left his work as a phys-ed trainer in Manchester, England, to join the mujahedin fighting the Russians in Chechnya. \"We will have victory like there was in Afghanistan,\" he says, \"and we will have total Islamic law. Not only in Chechnya, but reaching as far as Moscow, New York and Washington, D.C.\" Another video shows some rebels discussing the attack on the World Trade Center. Says one: \"It seems that America, between two oceans, cannot defend itself. With a few small knives you can take hundreds of thousands of lives. The Americans are hiding the real number of casualties so we won't celebrate.\" **ANCIENT HATREDS IN THE INTERNET AGE** In the loosely linked underworld of Al Qaeda, ancient ethnic struggles can turn into modern recruiting posters via the Internet. In the Moluccas, the former Spice Islands in Indonesia, Muslims and Christians are slaughtering each other, as they have from time to time over the centuries. But the Laskar Jihad fighters are using not only medieval-looking scimitars but a Web site. It attracts up to 2,500 hits a day from like-minded Netizens who view gory photos of anti-Muslim atrocities (\"His body was cut, his penis was put in his mouth\"). \"We are especially popular in California,\" says Laskar communications head Hardi Ibnu Harun. Bin Laden's training camps help sort the tourists from the true terrorists. In France, police are concerned about a half-dozen cases of \"missing sons\" who told their families they were going to fight \"in Bosnia in the Muslim struggle\" and have not", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:021029newsweek.txt:4:b5709f86efa6", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 7144, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "021029newsweek.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "021029newsweek", "chunk_index": 5, "text": "2,500 hits a day from like-minded Netizens who view gory photos of anti-Muslim atrocities (\"His body was cut, his penis was put in his mouth\"). \"We are especially popular in California,\" says Laskar communications head Hardi Ibnu Harun. Bin Laden's training camps help sort the tourists from the true terrorists. In France, police are concerned about a half-dozen cases of \"missing sons\" who told their families they were going to fight \"in Bosnia in the Muslim struggle\" and have not been heard from since. Officials now think that some of them may have found their way to Afghanistan and, once there, were essentially taken prisoner or brainwashed by cultists. \"The leaders in these camps separate out the strong from the weak,\" says one French authority. \"Those who are strong go on to fight and perhaps become leaders themselves. The weak may be simply eliminated.\" Some Al Qaeda operatives take their learning with them in a handy manual. A mixture of Quran quotes and practical tips for killing, the handbook has lessons on kidnapping and assassination using rifles and pistols (chapter 14), assassination using explosives (chapter 15) and assassination using poisons and cold steel (chapter 16). There is training in code (for example, how to encipher the instruction \"kill this devil\") and training in the proper posture for shooting someone (\"the body should be normal, not tense, and the joints relaxed, not too tight, not too loose\"). The manual instructs Al Qaeda fighters to lie low, not to visit mosques or publicly praise Allah, and it teaches them how to obtain false documents and aliases. As a practical matter, moving in and out of Western countries, with their porous borders and civil-rights sensitivities, has been a breeze. In 1997, New York police, tipped off by a neighbor, were able to foil a plot by Ghazi Ibrahum Aby Mezer to bomb the New York subway. It turned out Mezer had already been apprehended three times by the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service in the past 13 months for illegally entering the United States from Canada. The INS had begun a formal deportation proceeding, but he was free on bail and had filed a request for political asylum. The ground: he was afraid the Israeli government would arrest him for his membership in the Palestinian terrorist group Hamas. To a greater degree than they will ever want to admit, the intelligence and law-enforcement authorities of several Western countries have tolerated terrorists in their midst. The rationalization has always been that it's better to keep an eye on terror cells than drive them underground. Radical imams sometimes act as informants for law enforcement. In the murky world of terror cells, however, it is sometimes hard to tell who is an informant-and who is a double (or triple) agent.

When Al Qaeda networks moved into the Bosnian civil war, the CIA argued against expelling the extremists, insisting that it was more important to watch them and monitor their communications. The British have not been above tolerating some terrorists of their own. For years British authorities have permitted a rabid imam named Abu Qatada to preach at a social club in London. But when 18 videos of Abu Qatada's rants turned up in the Hamburg apartment of a fugitive member of Mohamed Atta's terrorist cell, the fiery imam became an instant candidate for new British laws designed to detain potential terrorists without trial. All over the world, America and its allies are trying to strangle the sleeper cells from within. But in the difficult war on terror, squeezing one end of the network may only push the poison in another direction. The war on the Taliban has created a flood of refugees. Some of them are holy warriors, who pay $20,000 to $30,000 to \"travel agents,\" professional smuggling syndicates that set them up with new identities and passports. Newly minted, the jihadists can go back into the world and start spreading terror all over again. **Bin Laden's Invisible Network** 1 of 5 1. Bin Laden's Invisible Network 2.

STEVENSON** WASHINGTON, Nov. 27 - President Bush today named Henry A. Kissinger, a Republican who has been one of the most respected but polarizing figures in foreign policy and Washington for more than three decades, to lead an independent investigation into the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. In choosing Mr. Kissinger, the president selected a person whose reputation as a towering intellect in foreign policy is matched by the passions he has aroused among critics of his role in the Vietnam War, relations with the Soviet Union and the exercise of American power in Latin America. Mr. Bush made the appointment as he signed legislation creating the commission, a step he came to support after opposing the bill for much of the year partly on the ground that it could divert attention from the war on terrorism. Democratic leaders in Congress, who will appoint half of the 10 members of the commission, immediately named George J. Mitchell, the former Senate majority leader and peace envoy to Northern Ireland and the Middle East, as vice chairman. The commission's mandate is to conduct a wide-ranging inquiry into the causes of the attacks, whether they could have been averted and what changes are needed to prevent a similar occurrence. The commission is required to complete its work within 18 months - a timetable that would have it issue its final report in the middle of a presidential election year - though Mr. Bush said he hoped it would finish sooner. The leaders of the two parties in Congress must appoint the rest of the members by Dec. 15. The commission will have the power to issue subpoenas by majority vote, and lawmakers have urged that it cast its net widely and interview current and former government officials, including Mr. Bush and his predecessor, Bill Clinton. The president cited Mr. Kissinger's long experience in and out of government, including his service as secretary of state in the Nixon and Ford administrations, in putting him in charge of an inquiry intended to explore", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:021128nytimes.txt:0:c9382d6c967d", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 7148, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "021128nytimes.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "021128nytimes", "chunk_index": 1, "text": "rest of the members by Dec. 15. The commission will have the power to issue subpoenas by majority vote, and lawmakers have urged that it cast its net widely and interview current and former government officials, including Mr. Bush and his predecessor, Bill Clinton. The president cited Mr. Kissinger's long experience in and out of government, including his service as secretary of state in the Nixon and Ford administrations, in putting him in charge of an inquiry intended to explore how failures in intelligence, immigration controls, law enforcement and foreign policy in the Bush and Clinton administrations might have contributed to the deaths of more than 3,000 people in the terrorist attacks. ``His investigation should carefully examine all the evidence and follow all the facts, wherever they lead,'' Mr. Bush said at the bill-signing ceremony, with Mr. Kissinger, who is 79, at his side. ``We must uncover every detail and learn every lesson of September the 11th.'' White House officials said Mr. Kissinger was an attractive choice for the job because while he has extensive experience, he has been out of government long enough that he has few ties to the people and agencies whose actions he would be examining. Advisers to the White House said the administration believed that Mr. Kissinger had sufficient prestige that he could be independent of Mr. Bush, but at the same time was someone Mr. Bush and his staff could be comfortable with. The appointment surprised relatives of the Sept. 11 victims, who had been the primary force behind the legislation and who had been consulting with the administration and Congressional leaders about who would be on the commission. It also raised questions among Democrats about whether Mr. Kissinger, who has served in some capacity under Nixon and every Republican president since, would be willing to pursue an aggressive investigation that would delve into delicate topics like the role of Saudi Arabia and risk findings that could prove politically explosive for Mr. Bush. In particular, they pointed to Mr. Kissinger's record of operating in secrecy and accusations about his involvement in incidents like the 1973 coup in Chile that toppled the Socialist government of Salvador Allende. But some Democrats said they were confident that Mr. Kissinger's stature and visibility, combined with the appointment of Mr. Mitchell by the Democrats and promises by the victims' families to keep up the pressure for a no-holds-barred inquiry, ensured that the commission would not be toothless.

Mr. Kissinger obviously has a keen intellect and vast experience in national security matters. Unfortunately, his affinity for power and the commercial interests he has cultivated since leaving government may make him less than the staunchly independent figure that is needed for this critical post. Indeed, it is tempting to wonder if the choice of Mr. Kissinger is not a clever maneuver by the White House to contain an investigation it long opposed. It seems improbable to expect Mr. Kissinger to report unflinchingly on the conduct of the government, including that of Mr. Bush. He would have to challenge the established order and risk sundering old friendships and business relationships. The Kissinger commission, in theory, should provide the definitive account of how a raft of government agencies -- including the White House, Central Intelligence Agency and Federal Bureau of Investigation -- left the nation so vulnerable to terrorist attack. That final reckoning is overdue and so far absent from the narrower inquiries done by Congress and individual agencies. It is essential to ensuring that past mistakes are not repeated. The new inquiry will be undone if the 10-member panel is hesitant to call government organizations and officials to account. There can be no place for the kind of political calculation and court flattery that Mr. Kissinger practiced so assiduously during his tenure as Richard Nixon's national security adviser and secretary of state. Nor is there any tolerance for the kind of cynicism that Mr. Kissinger applied to the prosecution of the Vietnam War. The commission will be made up of five Republicans and five Democrats. Choosing its remaining members and staff director wisely will also be vital to its success. They must be fiercely independent and unafraid to challenge some of Washington's most powerful institutions.

Choosing its remaining members and staff director wisely will also be vital to its success. They must be fiercely independent and unafraid to challenge some of Washington's most powerful institutions. We were mildly encouraged to hear Mr. Kissinger say that he would ''accept no restrictions'' on the commission's work. To deliver on that promise, Mr. Kissinger must start by severing all ties to Kissinger Associates, the lucrative consulting business he has built up during the past two decades. As a consultant, Mr. Kissinger offered not just his own foreign policy expertise, but his famously easy access to the powerful and well connected. Not long after Mr. Bush announced the appointment of Mr. Kissinger on Wednesday, Democratic Congressional leaders picked one of their brethren, former Senator George Mitchell, to serve as vice chairman. Like Mr. Kissinger, Mr. Mitchell has great experience and an understanding of how the world works -- and is not known for rocking established institutions. The commission offers both men a chance for the kind of career-crowning legacy that many public personages dream of. But that would require rising above Washington's usual hedging and horse-trading. If they succeed, they could help the nation recover from the grievous wounds of Sept. 11 and make sure the country is never so vulnerable again.

Thomas Kean, new chairman of the commission investigating the Sept. 11 attacks, promised a bipartisan and thorough investigation to determine why the attacks weren't prevented. President Bush appointed Kean on Monday, turning to a moderate Republican with a record of cooperation with Democrats to replace Henry Kissinger as chairman of the 10-member National Commission on Terrorist Attacks. Also Monday, Senate Republican leader Trent Lott filled the panel's last member with John Lehman, Navy secretary during the Reagan administration. Kissinger, secretary of state under Presidents Nixon and Ford, resigned Friday because of criticism over possible conflicts of interest that he said would have forced him to give up his consulting firm. Relatives of Sept. 11 victims said their support of Kean and his panel will depend on its political independence and whether commissioners have business conflicts that could affect their work. The commission, comprising five Democrats and five Republicans, will investigate issues related to the attacks, including intelligence, aviation security and immigration. It is expected to begin work next month. Kean, 67, is president of Drew University in Madison, N.J., about 30 miles from New York City. He was New Jersey's governor from 1982 to 1990. At a news conference, Kean said he learned of the appointment Sunday night. \"I feel like a ton of bricks fell on me,\" he said. \"The only instructions I got from the White House is to do the best job I could and to be bipartisan,\" he said. In a statement, Bush praised Kean's \"integrity, fairness and good judgment\" and said: \"It is important that we uncover every detail and learn every lesson of Sept. 11.\" Victims' relatives and some lawmakers have been skeptical about Bush's commitment to the investigation. Bush initially opposed the panel and later insisted on limitations to its subpoena authority. Both sides accused the other of trying to manipulate the panel for political purposes. The final report is due less than six months before the 2004 elections. Stephen Push of the advocacy group Families of September 11, said he was optimistic about the panel's independence. But he and other leaders of Sept. 11 organizations said they wanted to learn more about the commissioners' business", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:021217ap.txt:0:c4781722a887", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 7154, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "021217ap.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "021217ap", "chunk_index": 1, "text": "the investigation.

But he and other leaders of Sept. 11 organizations said they wanted to learn more about the commissioners' business dealings. \"Let's make sure everybody passes the conflicts test,\" said Kristen Breitweiser, a leader of September 11 Advocates. Breitweiser's husband, Ronald, a senior vice president of Fiduciary Trust International, was among 87 employees of the financial company who died at the World Trade Center. Kean has long served as a director of Fiduciary Trust. Kean also served on the board of Aramark Corp., which manages food and support services at office buildings and other facilities. Aramark ran the food court on top of 2 World Trade Center as well as concessions and tours of the observation deck. Several of its employees died in the tower. Besides Kissinger, the panel's original vice chairman, former Sen. George Mitchell, also resigned last week, partly because of objections raised about potential conflicts. Mitchell was replaced by former Rep. Lee Hamilton, D-Ind. Kean said he does not see any potential conflicts of interest and will make any financial disclosure required. He said the commission will be an opportunity for the country to draw together. \"I lost a number of good friends on 9-11. So did a lot of us in this area,\" he said. \"At this point in time the country needs to come together.\" Kean is a moderate Republican, liberal on many social issues, who has often been comfortable working with Democrats. He wrote a 1988 book titled \"Politics of Inclusion.\" ___ On the Net: Legislation to establish commission: [http://www.fas.org/irp/congress/2002_cr/SA4694.html](http://www.fas.org/irp/congress/2002_cr/SA4694.html) Keywords: Washington © The Associated Press KEN GUGGENHEIM; Associated Press Writer New chairman of 9-11 commission promises thorough investigation,12-17-2002 FAIR USE NOTICE: This site contains copyrighted material the use of which has not always been specifically authorized by the copyright owner.

Governor Kean Named to Replace Kissinger *Amy Goldstein Washington Post Staff writer * December 17, 2002; Page A1 President Bush yesterday appointed former New Jersey governor Thomas H. Kean to lead the prominent new commission that will investigate the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, three days after the abrupt resignation of former secretary of state Henry A. Kissinger, the administration's first choice. Bush announced the selection of Kean, a moderate Republican and a university president for the past dozen years, to replace Kissinger, who surprised the White House by withdrawing before the commission began its work, Kissinger cited widespread concern over potential conflicts of interest involving his business interests. Kean, a popular governor from 1982 to 1990, is widely perceived as independent-minded and skillful at management. But skeptics said he lacks expertise in immigration, intelligence, security and other realms the commission will explore as it tries to ferret out the governmental lapses that allowed the terrorist hijackings to succeed. According to administration officials, lawmakers and advocates who lobbied for creation of the National Commission on Terrorist Attacks, Kean will bring very different characteristics to the panel. \"While he doesn't have Henry Kissinger's depth in international affairs, he has a proven track record of bringing people together and finding unity,\" one administration official said. The White House portrayed Kean as close to families who lost relatives in the attacks. Kean said yesterday that the main reason the administration had mentioned in offering him the position Sunday night was his roots in the part of the country that had suffered the greatest losses. Bush announced his selection on the same day that Senate Republican leader Trent Lott (Miss.) named a former Navy secretary, John Lehman, as the 10th -- and final -- member of the commission. In choosing Lehman, Lott spurned former senator Warren B. Rudman (R-N.H.), the choice of two Republican senators who have been intimately involved with the commission's creation. Rudman, who helped lead a separate inquiry that exposed the nation's vulnerability to terrorism, was promoted for the new panel by victims' families and had been backedby Sens. John McCain (Ariz.) and Richard C. Shelby (Ala.).

John McCain (Ariz.) and Richard C. Shelby (Ala.). The appointments of Kean and Lehman complete the membership of an inquiry panel whose necessity, purpose and participants have been disputed for months. Like Kissinger, former Senate majority leader George J. Mitchell (D-Maine), the Democrats' initial choice for vice chairman, quit the panel even before it began its 18-month investigation. Mitchell also said he was deterred by the possibility that he would have to forsake some private sector work to make the commission truly neutral. By yesterday, the panel's most ardent champions suggested that the commission probably had attained neutrality, but might lack aggressiveness or expertise as a result. Kean, in particular, \"doesn't have the background in any of the areas that the commission will be [probing] -- diplomacy, aviation security, immigration policy, intelligence,\" said Stephen Push, a spokesman for Families of September 11, one of the family groups that welded their grief into a lobbying force for the commission. Outgoing Rep. Timothy J. Roemer (D-Ind.), who helped write the legislation creating the commission and is one of its members, said the panel \"is off to a bit of a bumpy start\" but predicted, \"we will be in very good shape,\" as long as it \"doesn't get into a partisan wrangling game.\" Roemer said that, while he believes Rudman would have brought \"fierce independence\" to the group's work, Kean has a background of \"moderation and working across the aisle.\" The commission will be the second to examine government failures that allowed the attacks. An investigation by the House and Senate intelligence committees turned up numerous lapses by the FBI, CIA and other agencies. The commission is equally divided between GOP and Democratic appointees. Advocates are wary that the panel, which will require six votes to issue a subpoena, may prove reticent to embarrass the administration by probing deeply into executive branch agencies that did not detect or thwart the terror plot. White House press secretary Ari Fleischer said the possibility of Kean as chairman was first broached to Bush in late October by the president's chief of staff, Andrew H. Card Jr. \"Andy started bouncing several names off the president,\" Fleischer said, adding that Kissinger was discussed at the same time. At a news conference at Drew University in Madison, N.J., where he is president, Kean said he spoke to the White House Saturday, the day after Kissinger stepped down.

Several conversations later, Kean said, Card telephoned him Sunday night to ask: \"Do you want to do it?\" Kean said his relationship with Bush is \"cordial\" and that they had met \"a couple of times.\" In the past, Kean has publicly distanced himself from elements of his own party, saying in 1995 that he was disturbed by the growing influence of \"right-wing radicals\" in the GOP. Yesterday, Kean sought to put to rest the matter of conflicts of interest, saying, \"I have no clients except the university.\" He said that he would remain the school's president, devoting one day a week to the commission's work. In a statement, Bush called Kean \"a leader respected for his integrity, fairness and good judgment,\" and said he expected that he would assure that the commission's work is \"thorough.\" Fleischer said Kean has a \"very close relationship with the 9/11 families,\" noting that he is a board member of a company that lost 80 employees in the attack on New York's World Trade Center. Kean identified the firm as Fiduciary Trust International and said he had spoken at a memorial service for its employees after the attacks. Correspondent Robert Strauss contributed to this report.

Sens. Jon Kyl and Pat Roberts said in a report that \"the answer to the question-could 9/11 have been prevented-is yes, if State Department personnel had merely followed the law and not granted non-immigrant visas to 15 of the 19 hijackers in Saudi Arabia.\" If U.S. laws had been followed, \"most of the hijackers would not have been able to obtain visas and 9/11 would not have happened,\" they said. They said the hijackers should have been denied visas as single young men with no visible means of support. Many lawmakers have criticized the State Department's handling of visas for the hijackers. But the criticism by Kyl and Roberts was among the most blunt in tying the issuance of the visas to the failure to stop the attacks. There was no immediate comment from the State Department. State Department officials have said previously they had no reason to believe the men were terrorists and that their visa policies have been improved since the attacks. Roberts and Kyl are members of the Senate Intelligence Committee, which along with its House counterparts, conducted the inquiry into intelligence failures leading up to the attacks. Roberts, of Kansas, will likely be the committee's chairman next year; Kyl, of Arizona, will have a top position in the Senate leadership. Their comments were included in a supplemental report to the inquiry's findings, which were completed last week. The committees found that intelligence agencies were poorly organized and slow to pursue clues that might have led to the attacks. They recommended creating a Cabinet-level national intelligence director to improve communications among agencies. In a separate supplemental report, Rep. Mike Castle, R-Del., also criticized the State Department, saying most of the hijackers were wrongly admitted \"as a result of decisions made and errors committed by responsible State Department and Justice Department officers.\" Roberts, Kyl and Castle all noted that State Department's actions was not", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:021218ap.txt:0:215328cd2016", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 7160, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "021218ap.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "021218ap", "chunk_index": 1, "text": "agencies were poorly organized and slow to pursue clues that might have led to the attacks.

A newly formed commission headed by former New Jersey Gov. Thomas Kean will examine immigration and other issues related to the attacks. Kyl and Roberts also criticized the recently completed congressional investigation of the Sept. 11 attacks, saying it didn't dig deeply enough into intelligence problems. They said intelligence committee leaders excluded lawmakers from key decisions during the investigation.

During the first weeks of 2002, two dark moods entered the room, two anxieties that rattled down everybody's nerve paths, even on good days, and etched their particulars into the general disposition. To begin with, after Sept. 11, the passage of time drew off the worst of the pain, but every month or so there came a new disturbance-an orange alert, a dance-club bombing in Bali, a surface-to-air missile fired at a passenger jet-that showed us the beast still at our door. In the confrontation with Iraq, in the contested effort to build a homeland defense, we all struggled to regain something like the more secure world we thought we lived in before the towers fell. But every step of the way we wondered-was this the way back? What exactly did we need to be doing differently? And all the while there was the black comedy of corporate fraud. Who knew that the swashbuckling economy of the '90s had produced so many buccaneers? You could laugh about the CEOs in handcuffs and the stock analysts who turned out to be fishier than storefront palm readers, but after a while the laughs came hard. Martha Stewart was dented and scuffed. Tyco was looted by its own executives. Enron and WorldCom turned out to be Twin Towers of false promises. They fell. Their stockholders and employees went down with them. So did a large measure of public faith in big corporations. Each new offense seemed to make the same point: with communism vanquished, capitalism was left with no real enemies", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:021222time.txt:0:6e9a3402d25f", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 7163, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "021222time.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "021222time", "chunk_index": 1, "text": "to be fishier than storefront palm readers, but after a while the laughs came hard. Martha Stewart was dented and scuffed. Tyco was looted by its own executives. Enron and WorldCom turned out to be Twin Towers of false promises. They fell. Their stockholders and employees went down with them. So did a large measure of public faith in big corporations. Each new offense seemed to make the same point: with communism vanquished, capitalism was left with no real enemies but its own worst impulses. It can be undone by its own overreaching players. It can be bitten to pieces by its own alpha dogs. Day after day, one set of misgivings twined around the other, keeping spooked investors away from the stock market, giving the whole year its undeniable saw-toothed edge. Were we headed for a world where all the towers would fall? All the more reason to figure out quickly, before the next blow to the system, how to repair the fail-safe operations-in the boardrooms we trusted with our money, at the government agencies we trust with ourselves-that failed. This is where three women of ordinary demeanor but exceptional guts and sense come into the picture. Sherron Watkins is the Enron vice president who wrote a letter to chairman Kenneth Lay in the summer of 2001 warning him that the company's methods of accounting were improper. In January, when a congressional subcommittee investigating Enron's collapse released that letter, Watkins became a reluctant public figure, and the Year of the Whistle-Blower began. Coleen Rowley is the FBI staff attorney who caused a sensation in May with a memo to FBI Director Robert Mueller about how the bureau brushed off pleas from her Minneapolis, Minn., field office that Zacarias Moussaoui, who is now indicted as a Sept. 11 co-conspirator, was a man who must be investigated. One month later Cynthia Cooper exploded the bubble that was WorldCom when she informed its board that the company had covered up $3.8 billion in losses through the prestidigitations of phony bookkeeping. These women were for the 12 months just ending what New York City fire fighters were in 2001: heroes at the scene, anointed by circumstance. They were people who did right just by doing their jobs rightly-which means ferociously, with eyes open and with the bravery the rest of us always hope we have and may never know if we do. Their lives may not have been at stake, but Watkins, Rowley and Cooper put pretty much everything else on the line. Their jobs, their health, their privacy, their sanity-they risked all of them to bring us badly needed word of trouble inside crucial institutions. Democratic capitalism requires that people trust in the integrity of public and private institutions alike. As whistle-blowers, these three became fail-safe systems that did not fail.

Democratic capitalism requires that people trust in the integrity of public and private institutions alike. As whistle-blowers, these three became fail-safe systems that did not fail. For believing-really believing-that the truth is one thing that must not be moved off the books, and for stepping in to make sure that it wasn't, they have been chosen by TIME as its Persons of the Year for 2002. WHO ARE THESE WOMEN? For starters, they aren't people looking to hog the limelight. All initially tried to keep their criticisms in-house, to speak truth to power but not to Barbara Walters. They became public figures only because their memos were leaked. One reason you still don't know much about them is that none have given an on-the-record media interview until now. In early December TIME brought all three together in a Minneapolis hotel room. Very quickly it became clear that none of them are rebels in the usual sense. The truest of true believers is more like it, ever faithful to the idea that where they worked was a place that served the wider world in some important way. But sometimes it's the keepers of the flame who feel most compelled to set their imperfect temple to the torch. When headquarters didn't live up to its mission, they took it to heart. At Enron the company handed out note pads with inspiring quotes. One was from Martin Luther King Jr.: \"Our lives begin to end the day we become silent about things that matter.\" Watkins saw that quote every day. Didn't anybody else? What more do they have in common? All three grew up in small towns in the middle of the country, in families that at times lived paycheck to paycheck. In a twist that will delight psychologists, they are all firstborns. More unusually, all three are married but serve as the chief breadwinners in their families. Cooper and Rowley have husbands who are full-time, stay-at-home dads. For every one of them, the decision to confront the higher-ups meant jeopardizing a paycheck their families truly depended on. The joint interview in Minneapolis was the first time the three had met. But in no time they recognized how much they knew one another's experience. During the ordeals of this year, it energized them to know that there were two other women out there fighting the same kind of battles. In preparation for their meeting in Minneapolis, WorldCom's Cooper read through the testimony that Enron's Watkins gave before Congress. \"I actually broke out in a cold sweat,\" Cooper says.

In preparation for their meeting in Minneapolis, WorldCom's Cooper read through the testimony that Enron's Watkins gave before Congress. \"I actually broke out in a cold sweat,\" Cooper says. In Minneapolis, when FBI lawyer Rowley heard Cooper talk about a need for regular people to step up and do the right thing, she stood up and applauded. And what to make of the fact that all are women? There has been talk that their gender is not a coincidence; that women, as outsiders, have less at stake in their organizations and so might be more willing to expose weaknesses. They don't think so. As it happens, studies have shown that women are actually a bit less likely than men to be whistle-blowers. And a point worth mentioning-all three hate the term whistle-blower. Too much like \"tattletale,\" says Cooper. But if the term unnerves them a bit, that may be because whistle-blowers don't have an easy time. Almost all say they would not do it again. If they aren't fired, they're cornered: isolated and made irrelevant. Eventually many suffer from alcoholism or depression. With these three, that hasn't happened, though Watkins left her job at Enron after a few months when she wasn't given much to do. But ask them if they have been thanked sincerely by anyone at the top of their organization, and they burst out laughing. Some of their colleagues hate them, especially the ones who believe that their outfits would have quietly righted all wrongs if only they had been given time. \"There is a price to be paid,\" says Cooper. \"There have been times that I could not stop crying.\" Watkins, Rowley and Cooper have kick-started conversations essential to the clean operation of American life, conversations that will continue for years. It may still be true that no one could have prevented the attacks of Sept. 11, but the past year has shown that the FBI and the CIA overlooked vital clues and held back data from each other. No matter how many new missile systems the Pentagon deploys or which new airport screening systems are adopted, if we can't trust the institutions charged with tracking terrorists to do the job, homeland defense will be an empty phrase. The Coleen Rowleys of the federal workforce will be the ones who will let us know what's going on. As for corporate America, accounting scams of the kind practiced at Enron and WorldCom will continually need to be exposed and corrected before yet another phalanx of high-level operators gets the wrong idea and a thousand Enrons bloom.

As for corporate America, accounting scams of the kind practiced at Enron and WorldCom will continually need to be exposed and corrected before yet another phalanx of high-level operators gets the wrong idea and a thousand Enrons bloom. And the people best positioned to call them on it will be sitting in offices like the ones that Watkins and Cooper occupied. The new Sarbanes-Oxley Act, which requires CEOs and CFOs to vouch for the accuracy of their companies' books, is just one sign of what Cooper calls \"a corporate-governance revolution across the country.\" These were ordinary people who did not wait for higher authorities to do what needed to be done. Literature's great statement on unwelcome truth telling is Ibsen's play An Enemy of the People. Something said by one of his characters reminds us of what we admire about our Dynamic Trio. \"A community is like a ship,\" he observes. \"Everyone ought to be prepared to take the helm.\" When the time came, these women saw the ship in citizenship. And they stepped up to that wheel. FAIR USE NOTICE: This site contains copyrighted material the use of which has not always been specifically authorized by the copyright owner.

BAGLI** Larry A. Silverstein, the developer who controls the World Trade Center lease, claims that his effort to get the largest possible insurance settlement to rebuild Lower Manhattan is being undermined by city officials. With public officials on the verge of adopting a development proposal for the site, Mr. Silverstein has complained in recent weeks that despite his legal obligation to rebuild the trade center he has been shut out of the planning process. At the same time, he said he has been undermined in his negotiations with the 23 insurance companies that provided coverage for the trade center. **Mr. Silverstein is battling the insurers in court, claiming that there were two separate attacks on two buildings at the trade center, entitling him to a double payment of nearly $7 billion that he would use for rebuilding.** In what one participant described as a confrontational meeting at City Hall on Thursday, Mr. Silverstein told Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg that the city's plan to take control of the 16-acre site and billions of dollars in insurance proceeds was unrealistic, according to people on both sides who were there. According to an executive who had been briefed on the City Hall meeting, Mr. Silverstein also objected to contact between the insurance companies and City Hall that he said undermined his efforts. That was a reference to what Mr. Silverstein believes were secret negotiations between Daniel L. Doctoroff, the deputy mayor for economic development, and Jacques E. Dubois, chairman of Swiss Re America, the largest of the insurers, over a possible insurance settlement, said the executive who had been briefed. Mr. Doctoroff, who attended the City Hall meeting, acknowledged that he had met with Mr. Dubois, but said the discussions were for informational purposes and did not constitute secret settlement negotiations. \"I have met with Jacques,\" Mr. Doctoroff said on Friday, \"just as I've met with every party", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:030216nytimes.txt:0:423c0403a787", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 7168, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "030216nytimes.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "030216nytimes", "chunk_index": 1, "text": "the deputy mayor for economic development, and Jacques E.

Michael McNamara, a spokesman for Swiss Re, said: \"We have meetings with many officials, both public and private. We don't comment on those meetings. We intend to be a good corporate citizen.\" Mr. Doctoroff has met Mr. Dubois before, over the city's Olympic bid. In December 2001, Swiss Re pledged to contribute at least $100,000 to NYC2012, a group founded by Mr. Doctoroff to promote the city's bid to be the host of the 2012 Olympic Games. Mr. Doctoroff resigned from the group after he became deputy mayor. Mr. Bloomberg has outlined a vision for Lower Manhattan that is at odds with Mr. Silverstein's. The mayor has proposed that the city take over the trade center site in a land swap with the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which currently owns the land. Under this plan, the city would buy out Mr. Silverstein and get the insurance proceeds, which could be spent on housing, transportation and other things both off and on the site. The mayor's plan envisioned negotiating a $5 billion insurance settlement. Mr. Doctoroff said that the number was merely an estimate and not the result of discussions with Swiss Re. But Mr. Silverstein told the mayor that the city's plan was not feasible. **Six weeks before the terrorist attack on the trade center, Mr. Silverstein completed a deal with the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey valued at $3.2 billion to lease the twin towers for 99 years.** His partner, Westfield America, leased the 450,000-square-foot underground mall. Mr. Silverstein said that under his lease, he is obligated to rebuild the 10 million square feet of office space that once stood at the trade center. But the two rebuilding proposals currently under consideration depict far less commercial space on the site. Mr. Silverstein contends that anything less than 10 million plays into the hands of the insurance companies, because they pay correspondingly less money. \"They're going to have to be tweaked to get up to 10 million square feet,\" Mr. Silverstein said of the proposals. His legal battles with the insurance companies have involved months of litigation and a host of claims and counterclaims, mostly expressed in dry legal terms. But Swiss Re has been unusually personal and vitriolic, describing Mr. Silverstein as", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:030216nytimes.txt:1:b1b4de969046", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 7169, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "030216nytimes.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "030216nytimes", "chunk_index": 2, "text": "contends that anything less than 10 million plays into the hands of the insurance companies, because they pay correspondingly less money. \"They're going to have to be tweaked to get up to 10 million square feet,\" Mr. Silverstein said of the proposals.

But Swiss Re has been unusually personal and vitriolic, describing Mr. Silverstein as a rapacious developer whose insurance claims are \"extortionate\" and a \"self-motivated hoax.\" Last August, Mr. Dubois of Swiss Re expressed enthusiasm for Mr. Doctoroff's land swap proposal. \"I think it's an opportunity for the city to take charge of the site,\" he said, adding, \"We'd be much more amenable in our negotiations if we thought the beneficiaries were the people of New York, rather than someone claiming a huge windfall.\" The remarks prompted one lawyer to wonder how an insurance company could offer two different settlements depending not on the insurance contract, but on the identity of the recipient. The Silverstein camp expressed outrage, suggesting that Mr. Doctoroff was doing the work of the insurance companies, an industry with which he was familiar during his career as an investment banker.

Connections And Then Some **David Rubenstein Has Made Millions Pairing the Powerful With the Rich** *Greg Schneider Washington Post Staff Writer * March 16, 2003; Page F1 David M. Rubenstein is exasperated, and he blurts something that a quick look around the room proves is outrageous: \"We're not,\" he nearly shouts, \"that well connected!\" Behind him is a picture of Rubenstein on a plane with then-Gov. George W. Bush. Across the room, a photo of Rubenstein with the president's father and mother. Next to that, Rubenstein and Mikhail Gorbachev. Elsewhere: Rubenstein and Jimmy Carter. On a bookshelf: Rubenstein and the pope. This is not some honor wall in Rubenstein's office on Pennsylvania Avenue, this is his wood-paneled den at home in Bethesda. The snapshots are nearly hidden among books and trinkets and family photos -- the decorating restraint of the truly, deeply connected. **Rubenstein, after all, is co-founder of the Carlyle Group, an investment house famous as one of the most well-connected companies anywhere.** Former president George H.W. Bush is a Carlyle adviser. Former British prime minister John Major heads its European arm. Former secretary of state James Baker is senior counselor, former White House budget chief Richard Darman is a partner, former SEC chairman Arthur Levitt is senior adviser -- the list goes on. Those associations have brought Carlyle enormous success. Founded in 1987 with $5 million, the Washington-based merchant bank controls nearly $14 billion in investments, making it the largest private equity manager in the world. It buys and sells whole companies the way some firms trade shares of stock. But the connections also have cost Carlyle, in ways that are hard to measure. It has developed a reputation as the CIA of the business world -- omnipresent, powerful, a little sinister. Media outlets from the Village Voice to BusinessWeek have depicted Carlyle as manipulating the levers of government from shadowy back rooms. \"The Iron Triangle,\" a book about the company due out", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:030316post.txt:0:b0547d3d3bb7", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 7172, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "030316post.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "030316post", "chunk_index": 1, "text": "in the world. It buys and sells whole companies the way some firms trade shares of stock. But the connections also have cost Carlyle, in ways that are hard to measure. It has developed a reputation as the CIA of the business world -- omnipresent, powerful, a little sinister. Media outlets from the Village Voice to BusinessWeek have depicted Carlyle as manipulating the levers of government from shadowy back rooms. \"The Iron Triangle,\" a book about the company due out next month, promises to take readers into \"a world that few of us can even imagine, full of clandestine meetings [and] quid pro quo deals.\" Last year, then-congresswoman Cynthia McKinney (D-Ga.) even suggested that Carlyle's and Bush's ties to the Middle East made them somehow complicitous in the Sept. 11 terror attacks. While her comments were widely dismissed as irresponsible, the publicity highlighted Carlyle's increasingly notorious reputation. Internet sites with headlines such as \"The Axis of Corporate Evil\" purport to link Carlyle to everything from Enron to al Qaeda. \"We've actually replaced the Trilateral Commission\" as the darling of conspiracy theorists, says Rubenstein -- who, truth be told, happens to be a member of the Trilateral Commission. It didn't help that **as the World Trade Center burned on Sept. 11, 2001, the news interrupted a Carlyle business conference at the Ritz-Carlton Hotel here attended by a brother of Osama bin Laden. Former president Bush, a fellow investor, had been with him at the conference the previous day.** But even if you believe the conspiracy theories that Carlyle luminaries are pulling strings on the company's behalf, there is evidence they haven't been very good at it lately. The current Bush administration has sloughed off advice from Baker calling for restraint in the Middle East, where Carlyle has investors, and from former president Bush on the need for calm on the Korean peninsula, where Carlyle owns banks. Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld even canceled the $11 billion Crusader howitzer program, a crucial contract for the Carlyle-owned United Defense company. Rubenstein resents the suggestion that Carlyle's bigwigs shape public policy for private gain -- it's what made him erupt in an interview about his lack of connections. \"Do you really think the current president of the United States would ruin his reputation and potentially hurt the United States because of his father's business interests? It's ludicrous,\" he says. \"Do you really think because your father's making speeches in Saudi Arabia you're going to tilt U.S. policy one way or the other? It's ridiculous, it's absurd.\" Still, he knows why people believe that about Carlyle. He even takes the blame for it. \"I probably failed in conveying the idea that we're not using this company in an inappropriate way,\" he says. Now, bit by bit, Rubenstein wants to change that image. A year ago he hired his first public relations specialist. Then, in November, he", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:030316post.txt:1:6fa74b57f810", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 7173, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "030316post.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "030316post", "chunk_index": 2, "text": "father's making speeches in Saudi Arabia you're going to tilt U.S. policy one way or the other?

He even takes the blame for it. \"I probably failed in conveying the idea that we're not using this company in an inappropriate way,\" he says. Now, bit by bit, Rubenstein wants to change that image. A year ago he hired his first public relations specialist. Then, in November, he replaced former defense secretary Frank Carlucci as Carlyle's chairman with a different type of heavyweight: Louis V. Gerstner Jr., the former chairman of IBM. It is Carlyle's first marquee hire from the world of business instead of government. It's only a step, and Carlyle has a long way to go to overcome its shadowy reputation. But Rubenstein has experience with transformation. His own career took a curious twist, as Rubenstein transformed himself from a young Carter White House policy wonk into a tycoon whose family safaris with Barbara Bush. \"His ideology was compatible with mine -- dedicated to human rights, civil rights, environmental quality, better education,\" Carter says in an interview. \"I have been truly amazed by what David has done since the White House years.\" Carlyle, in its early days, was a far humbler creature than it is now. In fact, the company's first successful venture sounds like something from a spam e-mail. Rubenstein had discovered a legal loophole allowing Native Americans in Alaska to sell their tax losses, and he did a brief, brisk business connecting Eskimos with corporations in search of a write-off. Congress quickly closed the loophole, and Carlyle moved on in search of companies to buy. It made an abortive stab at the Chi-Chi's restaurant chain, and bought the Caterair International airline food service -- putting George W. Bush on the board, but later selling it at a huge loss. The whole venture was something of a midlife crisis for Rubenstein, who had read somewhere that people rarely start businesses after they are in their late thirties. He had been treading water in a Washington law office, and through old friend Ed Mathias, then of Legg Mason, hooked up with a few other men of similar age looking to get into something new. What they started was a private equity firm, aimed at using money from rich people or institutions to buy companies, run them for a while and sell them, hopefully at a profit. Carlyle was named for the swanky-sounding New York hotel, but that city's elite derided the little company for being based in a financial backwater like Washington. Rubenstein craved legitimacy, so he paid attention when a former law partner passed on the tip that a big name in government, Carlucci, was about to leave office and was looking for opportunities. Rubenstein resolved to hire him. \"He was a person of some", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:030316post.txt:2:098a18924e7c", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 7174, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "030316post.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "030316post", "chunk_index": 3, "text": "for a while and sell them, hopefully at a profit.

Rubenstein resolved to hire him. \"He was a person of some prominence. We were a 10-person firm, we thought hiring a person who was better known than we were might help us get our calls returned more. It was nothing more nefarious than that, or more intelligent than that,\" Rubenstein says. It worked. Carlucci is one of the world's great networkers. He got insight into business deals all over the country by serving on a long list of corporate boards. With his Pentagon background, he pushed Carlyle to buy defense contractors at a time when such companies were out of favor with investors. When the defense industry later consolidated, Carlyle minted money by selling its pieces to the dominant new corporations. Carlucci became chairman, and Rubenstein realized he had hit on a winning formula: If you put powerful people next to rich people, some of the power rubs off on the rich guys and some of the money rubs off on the powerful guys. Rubenstein began hiring other statesmen like a football owner stocking his team with stars, and the company steered its investments into government-regulated industries. He got Baker, the former secretary of state, in a twofer with Darman, the former White House budget director. Former FCC chairman William Kennard signed on to oversee telecommunications and media investing. Former SEC chairman Levitt is helping Carlyle find companies to buy and advising on corporate ethics. Baker helped land Bush, whose primary function is to give speeches for Carlyle that attract wealthy foreigners in places where the former president is especially revered, such as Asia. After Bush speaks, Rubenstein and others close in to get the wowed attendees to entrust them with their riches. The company has rewarded its faithful with a 36 percent average annual rate of return. It has done so through deals such as its $165 million purchase of Magnavox Electronic Systems in 1993, which it sold two years later for $370 million. Or its 1997 purchase of United Defense for $180 million. Four years later -- just before Rumsfeld canceled its Crusader howitzer program -- Carlyle took United Defense public and sold about half the stock for $588 million. Such deals are the province of co-founders Daniel D'Anielo, who runs daily operations, and William Conway, who oversees investments. Rubenstein is the people person.

He travels 300 days a year recruiting investors, visiting employees, scouting for opportunities. He is a Jew who sips tea in Arabian palaces, the son of a Baltimore postal worker who buys pinstripe suits -- all alike -- in London. His role would suggest some- one with a chamber-of-commerce smile, a two-handed handshake. Rubenstein is not that guy. \"I'm a pretty serious person,\" he says, cataloguing the sins he avoids: \"I don't drink alcohol, I don't smoke, I don't play golf.\" At 53, he manages to look boyish even though his hair has gone white. His eyebrows are still dark, a{grv} la Steve Martin, and his mannerisms -- the palms-up shrug, the fast blinking when he makes a point -- evoke a less-hyper Woody Allen. One of the most complicated things about Rubenstein is his sense of humor, which is pervasive but so bone-dry and understated that it's almost sneaky. When he greets someone for the first time with the stony-faced line \"You were promised lunch, but the truth is, we don't actually have any lunch,\" the effect is off-putting and then amusing, a kind of barbed-wire charm. Rubenstein also is relentlessly self-deprecating. Being a reporter must be a fascinating job, he'll say -- \"with the exception of this interview.\" President Bush would no doubt love to have his advice, he deadpans, \"so he could get inflation to 18 percent\" the way Carter did with Rubenstein's help. He speed-reads 10 newspapers a day and six books a week. Among the clutter on his coffee table one Saturday afternoon: Gulf Business magazine, the book \"What Went Wrong: Western Impact and Middle Eastern Response\" by Bernard Lewis and \"The Lexus and the Olive Tree\" by New York Times columnist Thomas Friedman. Despite his drive to stay informed, Rubenstein also nurses an image as someone apart from the modes of the day. He hasn't seen a movie \"in a dozen years.\" He carries a cell phone for emergencies, but doesn't know its number. He gets some 200 e-mails daily and responds to them all -- though he writes the responses on a legal pad and has an assistant type them into the computer. Rubenstein's only real indulgence is gossip, which he uses both to reward and to milk his global network of big names. Otherwise, the man has no diversions. Work is his hobby. \"If I were forced to relax in conventional ways I'm convinced I'd have a heart attack,\" he says. \"I came from a very modest background, worked very hard and now I've achieved something --", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:030316post.txt:4:7255dac3667a", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 7176, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "030316post.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "030316post", "chunk_index": 5, "text": "the responses on a legal pad and has an assistant type them into the computer.

Work is his hobby. \"If I were forced to relax in conventional ways I'm convinced I'd have a heart attack,\" he says. \"I came from a very modest background, worked very hard and now I've achieved something -- not a Nobel Peace Prize, not Bill Gates, but something.\" An only child, Rubenstein was raised in a working-class Jewish neighborhood in the Pikesville section of Baltimore. \"It was a rigidly segregated place by religion,\" he says. But everything changed for him when he went to Baltimore's enormous City College public high school. There Rubenstein became friends with a charismatic football star named Kurt Schmoke, who one day would become the first elected black mayor of Baltimore. The two were members of the Lancers, a club for boys founded and still operated by retired Baltimore judge Robert I.H. Hammerman. \"I didn't think David was a leader in the sense of Kurt being a leader, in the sense of being president of a class or president of a school,\" says Hammerman, who recalls urging the teenage Rubenstein to believe in himself. \"I didn't think David at that time had that in him because he was too shy and too unsure of himself. . . . He did not have much self-confidence then, [though] he might feel he always bristled with confidence, because he certainly bristles with it now.\" Rubenstein went on to Duke University and won a scholarship to the University of Chicago Law School. After a couple of years working at a law firm in New York City, Rubenstein signed on as legal counsel to the presidential campaign of Birch Bayh. When Jimmy Carter won the Democratic presidential nomination in 1976, Rubenstein won a job crafting domestic policy with campaign adviser Stuart Eizenstat. The two formed a close working relationship, and after the election Rubenstein found himself as the president's deputy domestic policy adviser at the age of only 27. Intoxicated by the job, Rubenstein made himself indispensable through sheer labor. \"He devoted probably more hours to his work in the White House than anyone on my staff, so far as I ever knew,\" Carter says. \"He was a reticent person as far as putting himself forward. He was very modest, and never claimed credit for successes when they did materialize. . . . And he never betrayed me.\" Newsweek magazine profiled Rubenstein in 1978 as the prototypical hyper-committed young policy wonk -- eating dinner from a vending machine, all but sleeping in his office. As the last one out of the West Wing most nights, Rubenstein would put his and Eizenstat's memos at the top of the pile in", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:030316post.txt:5:dbc3d1f52d16", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 7177, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "030316post.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "030316post", "chunk_index": 6, "text": "person as far as putting himself forward.

As the last one out of the West Wing most nights, Rubenstein would put his and Eizenstat's memos at the top of the pile in the president's private study, ensuring Carter always knew their positions. A jealous staffer with the Office of Management and Budget eventually got a Secret Service agent to sniff out his technique and put that agency's memo on top, Rubenstein says. He likes to add that he didn't speak to that staffer for months, but later married her. Alice Rogoff Rubenstein went on to become an assistant to Donald Graham, then publisher of The Washington Post, and she later spent eight years as chief financial officer of U.S. News & World Report. Rubenstein also recruited his old friend Schmoke to the White House staff. \"All the legends about him and how hard he worked are absolutely correct,\" Schmoke says. \"He was somebody that I never heard anybody say anything critical or a bad word about. He was always somebody concerned about community. . . . He was very much interested in public policy concerns, and broad societal issues.\" Then, to Rubenstein's surprise, Carter failed to win a second term. Lawyers who had once dangled job offers now didn't return Rubenstein's calls. He eventually hired on at the firm of Shaw, Pittman, Potts & Trowbridge, but found that he didn't really enjoy the work. Eizenstat, who remains a close friend, didn't worry about Rubenstein, because he figured he would follow a path similar to his own -- practice law, write papers for think tanks, step in and out of Democratic administrations. But Walter Mondale's big loss in 1984 soured Rubenstein on politics. And as he entered his late thirties, he was restless for something to focus all that intense drive upon. Something that might carry a significant paycheck. So he took the leap and formed Carlyle. Not long after the firm started up, Rubenstein met Judge Hammerman for lunch at Duke Zeibert's. \"I just want you to know,\" he said to his old mentor, \"I'm not selling out.\" Rubenstein got his payday, and then some. He has lost track of his net worth, he says, because Carlyle's structure gives him an interest in each of the firm's 250-plus investments, and those values fluctuate. But it's safe to say he has many millions. The Rubensteins remodeled their Georgian-style home in Bethesda -- assessed last year at $1.7 million -- then bought the place next door and renovated it as a guesthouse. They built a 10,000-square-foot chalet in Beaver Creek, Colo., and a compound", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:030316post.txt:6:a5a27524592e", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 7178, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "030316post.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "030316post", "chunk_index": 7, "text": "and then some.

The Rubensteins remodeled their Georgian-style home in Bethesda -- assessed last year at $1.7 million -- then bought the place next door and renovated it as a guesthouse. They built a 10,000-square-foot chalet in Beaver Creek, Colo., and a compound that sleeps 30 on Nantucket. For all that, Rubenstein spends most of his time on airplanes or in hotels. He likes to point out that he neither skis nor sails, and visits those getaway homes maybe one week apiece each year. \"I'm kind of fascinated with his acquisition of houses,\" says Arthur Levitt, the former SEC chairman. \"I'm not convinced that he likes any of these houses a great deal. . . . He talks about them, but I certainly don't have the feeling that he has any commitment to them whatsoever.\" Despite his riches, Rubenstein has hung on to the persona of the earnest staffer laboring to make the marquee names look good. He hates the spotlight so much, associates say, he'll rearrange place cards at dinner to get himself off the head table. But what he's really doing is putting big potential investors next to the guest of honor, softening them up. One thing that has changed about Rubenstein is his politics. He hasn't let go of his roots -- his wife, Alice Rogoff Rubenstein, is on the board of the Carter Center, and the Carters were overnight guests at the Rubensteins' Nantucket home this summer. But George and Barbara Bush are more common houseguests. Rubenstein's wife and three children went along on a safari with Mrs. Bush, and the Rubensteins were among a select group invited to the former first lady's 75th-birthday party. \"Spending time with them has affected my political views,\" Rubenstein says. Rather than Democrat or Republican, he now sees himself as a capital-C Capitalist. And he says he wants to position his company the same way. Rubenstein has refused to let Carlyle form its own political action committee, and he has all but stopped making political donations. Since 1999 Rubenstein has contributed a total of about $2,500 to political campaigns, all Republican, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. Others associated with Carlyle have given far more. From 1999 to 2000, people affiliated with the firm gave nearly $224,000 to Democratic candidates and groups and nearly $248,000 to Republicans, according to the center's numbers. Carlucci and co-founder William Conway are the company's most generous givers. Numbers were way down in the post-presidential 2000 to 2001 cycle: $27,350 to Democrats and $81,285 to Republicans.

Rubenstein says he voted for the current president but did not raise money for him, and that he has visited this Bush White House only once, when a friend was involved in staging a Kennedy Center event. Critics argue that the Carlyle magic can't be gauged by such traditional standards. \"My concern is the influence that Carlyle has that is not accountable or monitored,\" says Charles Lewis of the Center for Public Integrity watchdog group. \"This is a company that doesn't register for the most part in terms of its activities in Washington. It clearly has enormous influence, I mean astonishing influence.\" Even Rubenstein, for all his protests that Carlyle doesn't consciously lobby the government, concedes that \"maybe you get this influence by people thinking you have it.\" How do you measure the impact, Lewis asks, when a company's top executive -- Carlucci -- chats at a cocktail party with Donald Rumsfeld about their wrestling days at Princeton? Or when its top adviser is not only a former president but once changed the diapers of the current president? It's not just in Washington that such questions arise. Last year when the British government decided to privatize its secret technology lab by selling a stake to Carlyle, commentators and even some of the lab's employees expressed outrage about the company's ties to former British prime minister Major and to U.S. power brokers. Also last year, Carlyle made the seemingly innocuous purchase of a Hong Kong company that is the world's biggest manufacturer of artificial Christmas trees. Shareholders in the Chinese company who opposed the sale pointed out that one of its top executives kept a picture of Major in his office, implying that once again Carlyle's connections had given it an unfair advantage. One Carlyle insider, while vigorously defending the company's ethics, concedes that there is often an unsaid component to overseas dealings in which \"certain types of investors\" will assume Carlyle's big names mean big influence. \"No matter how much you try to tell them, they think it's like their system,\" the source says. That's also why the Internet hosts a robust strain of Carlyle-bashing. A British musical act calling itself the Carlyle Group has posted songs online with titles like \"Vast Right-Wing Conspiracy\" and \"Blinded by the Right.\" One Web site offers a \"Carlyle Casino\" slot machine that uses pictures of Bush, Baker and Carlucci in place of cherries, bells and bars.

Pull the handle, line up the photos and find out \"Who's making billions from the War on Terror?\" The characterization infuriates some of Carlyle's biggest names. \"I say that's bull[expletive], and you can print it!\" snaps Baker. \"Somebody would say, well, you had one of the bin Laden brothers as an investor. Well, that's exactly right,\" he says, adding that the bin Ladens are one of the wealthiest families in the Middle East and have disowned Osama. Still, to deflect criticism, Rubenstein returned the bin Ladens' $2 million investment, and said that while Carlyle still has other investors in the Middle East, it no longer owns any companies there. But even people who aren't looking for sinister conspiracies have questioned Rubenstein's approach with Carlyle. Rep. Marcy Kaptur (D-Ohio) was once a junior member of Carter's domestic policy staff and is amazed by her former colleague's career. \"I sort of saw David as the ultimate public servant. He was so selfless. He gave all that effort over all that period of time,\" she says. But now he has become something else: \"I want to use a complimentary word here, I don't want to say a shadowy figure,\" Kaptur says. \"Kind of a translucent figure.\" Using former statesmen such as Bush and Baker to pursue private gain just seems inherently wrong, she says. \"I think that using your public-sector contacts to aggrandize yourself when you leave . . . creates a view that the public sector is for sale.\" Rubenstein understands the negative way some people view what he's done. Democrats, especially, \"often consider the making of money in this kind of private-equity business as not as socially significant as working in a foundation or in government,\" he says. But he argues that Carlyle has contributed to the social good: it has created jobs and generated wealth for investors that include the California Public Employees Retirement System and other major pension funds. Former president Carter says he finds no fault in Carlyle's stable of statesmen. \"I think each public official, once leaving office, is as completely free as all other citizens of the United States to shape their own careers, within the bounds of ethical proprieties,\" he says. But he is quick to add that Carlyle is something \"in which, by the way, I have never been involved at all. I have never been in the commercial life at all.\" He did make one speech at a Carlyle conference, he says, but only to promote the Carter Center. Times are", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:030316post.txt:9:5bb4593eb4a6", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 7181, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "030316post.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "030316post", "chunk_index": 10, "text": "once leaving office, is as completely free as all other citizens of the United States to shape their own careers, within the bounds of ethical proprieties,\" he says. But he is quick to add that Carlyle is something \"in which, by the way, I have never been involved at all. I have never been in the commercial life at all.\" He did make one speech at a Carlyle conference, he says, but only to promote the Carter Center. Times are changing, though. It's no longer valid to assume that Carlyle's golden roll of all-stars automatically opens doors in certain parts of the world, says Youssef M. Ibrahim of the Council on Foreign Relations in New York. \"George Bush junior is kind of screwing his father up, slowly but surely, in terms of securing relationships in the region,\" Ibrahim says of the Mideast. The current administration's support for Israel, its hostility toward Iraq and its rocky dealings with the Saudi royal family have soured business and political relationships alike, he says. In that light, it was especially good timing last year when Levitt introduced Rubenstein to Gerstner. The legendary IBM executive was planning to retire, and Rubenstein, much as he did 15 years before with Carlucci, resolved to hire him. It was past time for Carlyle to work on its image, Rubenstein decided. Frustrated by the conspiracy theories, burned by the Sept. 11-bin Laden situation, Rubenstein viewed hiring Gerstner as the beginning of the next stage for his company. \"Maybe you would say it's an evolution,\" he says. Political connections got them started, but now Rubenstein would like Carlyle to take the next step -- becoming part of the bedrock of American finance, an institution that outlives its founders, the \"Goldman Sachs of private equity.\" As for his own future, Rubenstein has been thinking about someday getting his hand back into an administration. Not as a staffer or appointee -- that would be too restrictive, he says. No, Rubenstein now understands that if you want to do something to affect public policy, being the rich buddy of a sitting president would be the way to do it. \"I'm not as convinced as I once was when my hair was dark and I was 27 that all public-policy achievements are accomplished within government,\" he says. \"I can have influence, if I want to, on the outside.\" **Note: **For another revealing article in *The Economist* on President George H.W.

Is this a fair criticism? Yes No [**Get results and comments**](http://info.detnews.com/feedback/lettersindex.cfm?topic=Fuming_about_Ford&forum=dnletters) [Comment on this story](javascript:comments(letteradress)) [Send this story to a friend](javascript:shareit()) [Get Home Delivery](https://secure.detroitnewspapers.com/circ/cgi-bin/delivery.plx?selectedpaper=detnews) **DEARBORN** -- The Washington, D.C.-based Sierra Club is the latest environmental group to use [Ford Motor Co.](javascript:companybox('F'))'s high-profile centennial party next week to pressure the automaker to boost the fuel economy of its cars and trucks. Once a fan of Ford Chairman and CEO Bill Ford Jr., the Sierra Club said Tuesday it will place ads in the New York Times and BusinessWeek magazine slamming the company's environmental record. The ads -- being published to coincide with Ford's 100th anniversary June 16 -- say Ford has failed to improve the fuel efficiency of its vehicles. After depicting technological advances in other industries, the ad says that Ford's Model T, which went 25 miles on a gallon of gasoline, was more fuel efficient than the current Ford Explorer sport-utility vehicle -- which manages just 16 miles per gallon. Two other groups, San Francisco-based Global Exchange and Rainforest Action Network, have asked the Dearborn Police Department for a permit to hold demonstrations beginning June 14 across from Ford headquarters. The activists staged their first demonstration last Saturday in San Francisco. Ford has become a favorite target of environmental groups in recent years. The criticism intensified earlier this year when Ford backed away from a pledge to improve the fuel economy of its SUV fleet by 25 percent over five years. Bill Ford may also be paying the price for being outspoken about his commitment to cleaner cars and factories. \"I would be lying to you if I said I wasn't kind of hurt by (the criticism),\" he told Wall Street analysts last month. \"Because to be singled out, when for many years I felt I was a lone voice in the wilderness, surprised me. \"I have put a lot of myself on the line over the years for this issue and will continue to in the future. But there have been some business realities I've had to judge over the last couple years where we've had to make some choices.\" The 700,000-member Sierra Club said its ads are meant to prod Ford into making fuel economy a top priority over the next century. **You can reach Mark Truby at (313) 222-2082 or mtruby@ detnews.com.** [Previous Story](http://www.detnews.com/2003/autosinsider/0306/08/c01-183238.htm) [Next Story](http://www.detnews.com/2003/autosinsider/0306/08/c03-183168.htm) Autos Insider", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:030604detroitnewsepaaveragempg1.txt:0:39af96b228a9", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 7184, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "030604detroitnewsepaaveragempg1.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "030604detroitnewsepaaveragempg1", "chunk_index": 1, "text": "myself on the line over the years for this issue and will continue to in the future.

O'Dell, the chief executive of Diebold Inc., sat down at his computer to compose a letter inviting 100 wealthy and politically inclined friends to a Republican Party fund-raiser, to be held at his home in a suburb of Columbus, Ohio. ''I am committed to helping Ohio deliver its electoral votes to the president next year,'' wrote Mr. O'Dell, whose company is based in Canton, Ohio. That is hardly unusual for Mr. O'Dell. A longtime Republican, he is a member of President Bush's ''Rangers and Pioneers,'' an elite group of loyalists who have raised at least $100,000 each for the 2004 race. But it is not the only way that Mr. O'Dell is involved in the election process. Through Diebold Election Systems, a subsidiary in McKinney, Tex., his company is among the country's biggest suppliers of paperless, touch-screen voting machines. Judging from Federal Election Commission data, at least eight million people will cast their ballots using Diebold machines next November. That is 8 percent of the number of people who voted in 2000, and includes all voters in the states of Georgia and Maryland and those in various counties of California, Virginia, Texas, Indiana, Arizona and Kansas. Some people find Mr. O'Dell's pairing of interests -- as voting-machine magnate and devoted Republican fund-raiser -- troubling. To skeptics, including more than a few Democrats, it raises at least the appearance of an ethical problem. Some of the chatter on the Internet goes so far as to suggest that he could use his own machines to sway the election. Senator Jon Corzine, Democrat of New Jersey, does not buy such conspiracy theories, but he said he was appalled at the situation.", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:031109nytimes.txt:0:513754f7c237", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 7187, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "031109nytimes.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "031109nytimes", "chunk_index": 1, "text": "find Mr. O'Dell's pairing of interests -- as voting-machine magnate and devoted Republican fund-raiser -- troubling.

Some of the chatter on the Internet goes so far as to suggest that he could use his own machines to sway the election. Senator Jon Corzine, Democrat of New Jersey, does not buy such conspiracy theories, but he said he was appalled at the situation. ''It's outrageous,'' he said. ''Not only does Mr. O'Dell want the contract to provide every voting machine in the nation for the next election -- he wants to 'deliver' the election to Mr. Bush. There are enough conflicts in this story to fill an ethics manual.'' Mr. O'Dell declined to be interviewed for this article, but a company official said that his political affiliations had nothing to do with Diebold's operations, and that the company derived the bulk of its revenue from A.T.M.'s, not voting machines. ''This is not Diebold; this is Wally O'Dell personally,'' said Thomas W. Swidarski, senior vice president for strategic development and global marketing at Diebold, who works closely with Mr. O'Dell. ''The issue has been misconstrued.'' BUT the controversy surrounding Diebold goes beyond its chief executive's political activities. In July, professors at Johns Hopkins University and Rice University analyzed the software code for the company's touch-screen voting machines and concluded that there was ''no evidence of rigorous software engineering discipline'' and that ''cryptography, when used at all, is used incorrectly.'' Making matters worse, the software code for the machines was discovered in January by a Seattle-area writer on a publicly accessible Internet site. That the code was unprotected constitutes a significant security lapse by Diebold, said Aviel D. Rubin, an associate professor of computer science at Johns Hopkins, co-author of the study of the code. Mr. Swidarski said the code on the Internet site was outdated and was not now in use in machines. About 15,000 internal Diebold e-mail messages also found their way to the Internet. Some referred to software patches installed on Diebold machines days before elections. Others indicated that the Microsoft Access database used in Diebold's tabulation servers was not protected by passwords. Diebold, which says passwords are now installed on machines, is threatening legal action against anyone who posts the files or links to them, contending that the e-mail is copyrighted. A recent report for the state of Maryland by SAIC, an engineering and research firm, has added to concerns about the security of Diebold's systems. It recommended 17 steps that Maryland election officials could take to ensure better security when using Diebold's machines. The company seized upon this as evidence that its systems, if used properly, were secure. But the report's overall assessment was not particularly upbeat. ''The system, as implemented in policy, procedure and technology, is at high risk", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:031109nytimes.txt:1:3d0081773867", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 7188, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "031109nytimes.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "031109nytimes", "chunk_index": 2, "text": "A recent report for the state of Maryland by SAIC, an engineering and research firm, has added to concerns about the security of Diebold's systems.

''The system, as implemented in policy, procedure and technology, is at high risk of compromise,'' SAIC wrote. It has been a bumpy couple of months for Mr. O'Dell, 58, who is known as Wally and spent 33 years at Emerson Electric before joining what is now Diebold Election Systems. Associates say he was stunned by the reaction to his August letter and now regrets writing it. ''Wally's going to take a lower profile on this stuff,'' Mr. Swidarski said. But Mr. Swidarski did not indicate that Mr. O'Dell would put a halt to all of his political activities. Those have included attendance at a Bush fund-raiser in Cincinnati on Sept. 30 and a flight to Crawford, Tex., in August for a Pioneers and Rangers meeting attended by the president. Other Diebold executives have contributed to President Bush's re-election campaign. According to data reported to the Federal Election Commission, 11 executives have added a total of $22,000 to the president's campaign coffers this year. No money from Diebold or its executives has gone to Democratic presidential candidates this year. The controversy over security has started to affect Diebold's business. Last week, the office of the California secretary of state halted certification of Diebold's latest touch-screen voting machines, which individual counties are considering using. In Wisconsin, security concerns have soured election officials' perceptions of computerized voting. ''We were already not strongly in favor of it, but the whole problem has changed when you're getting e-mails every week saying, 'You're not going to do this, right?''' said Kevin J. Kennedy, director of Wisconsin's election board. Matt Summerville, an analyst at McDonald Investments in Cleveland, said the California decision could cause Diebold to book less revenue in its voting division this year than it had hoped. ''It has certainly made their business a little more challenging,'' said Mr. Summerville, who expects the voting division to contribute $113 million this year to Diebold's total revenue of $2.1 billion. So far, investors have not seemed concerned. Diebold's stock is up almost 36 percent for the year. Until recently, Diebold's voting business looked extremely promising. Florida's electoral fiasco in 2000 confirmed what many state and county election officials had known for years: that punch-card systems were outdated. Encouraged by a new federal law that set aside $3.9 billion for voting improvements, many states and counties are moving rapidly to computer-based systems.

Analysts say the biggest beneficiaries of the federal dollars are likely to be Diebold, Election Systems & Software in Omaha and Sequoia Voting Systems, based in Oakland, Calif. So far, Washington has provided $650 million to states to buy new voting machines and improve the election process, though most of that has yet to be spent. An additional $830 million is waiting to be disbursed as soon as a new national oversight committee for elections is established. NOT everyone is convinced that spending hundreds of millions of dollars to computerize the nation's voting is a good thing. The Johns Hopkins and SAIC reports are part of a growing chorus of criticism about the reliability and safety of paperless voting systems. ''There's a feeling in the computer scientist community of utter dismay about the state of voting-machine technology,'' said Douglas W. Jones, an associate professor of computer science at the University of Iowa and a member of Iowa's board of examiners for voting machines. David L. Dill, a computer science professor at Stanford, said: ''If I was a programmer at one of these companies and I wanted to steal an election, it would be very easy. I could put something in the software that would be impossible for people to detect, and it would change the votes from one party to another. And you could do it so it's not going to show up statistically as an anomaly.'' Diebold says there are enough checks and balances in the system to catch this. ''Programmers do not set up the elections; election officials do,'' Mr. Swidarski said. ''All a programmer knows are numbers, which are not assigned to real people and parties until set-up time.'' But Professor Dill says the inherent complexity of software code makes it nearly impossible to ensure that computerized elections are fair. He advocates that machines be required to print out a paper ballot, which voters can use to verify their selections and which will serve as an audit trail in the event of irregularities or recounts. Touch-screen machines from Diebold, called AccuVotes, do not have such a ''voter verified'' paper trail. ES&S and Sequoia are working on prototypes for machines with printers. Diebold's machines are like A.T.M.'s, in that voters touch their selection and hit ''enter'' to record their votes onto memory cards inside each terminal. After voting has ended, the memory cards are inserted into a Diebold server at each precinct. The results are tabulated and sent by modem, or the data disks are sent to", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:031109nytimes.txt:3:e7f5732cd8b0", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 7190, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "031109nytimes.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "031109nytimes", "chunk_index": 4, "text": "machines from Diebold, called AccuVotes, do not have such a ''voter verified'' paper trail.

After voting has ended, the memory cards are inserted into a Diebold server at each precinct. The results are tabulated and sent by modem, or the data disks are sent to a central office. Rebecca Mercuri, a computer scientist and president of the consulting firm Notable Software, who has been studying election systems for 14 years, says the trouble with this system is that it is secretive. It prohibits anyone from knowing whether the data coming out of the terminals represents what voters actually selected. If someone were to challenge election results, the data in memory cards and the software running the voting terminals could be examined only by Diebold representatives. MS. MERCURI ran up against this last year, when she served as a consultant in a contested city council election in Boca Raton, Fla. Her request to look at the software inside the city's machines, made by Sequoia, to see if there were any bugs or malfunctions, was denied by a judge on the grounds that the technology was protected by trade-secret clauses. Sequoia, ES&S and Diebold routinely include such clauses in their contracts. ''These companies are basically saying 'trust us,''' Ms. Mercuri said. ''Why should anybody trust them? That's not the way democracy is supposed to work.'' Representative Rush D. Holt, Democrat of New Jersey, is leading an effort to make computerized voting more transparent. His bill, introduced this year, would require that computerized voting systems produce a voter-verified paper ballot and that the software code be publicly available. The bill, in the House Administration Committee, has 60 co-sponsors, all Democrats. ''Someone said to me the other day, 'We've had these electronic voting machines for several years now and we've never had a problem.' And I said, 'How do you know?' and he couldn't answer that,'' Representative Holt said. ''The job of verification shouldn't belong to the company; it should belong to the voter.'' Diebold said it would be willing to attach ballot printers to touch-screen machines if customers wanted them. But Mr. Swidarski said elections boards were not clamoring for it. ''We're agnostic to it,'' he said. Mr. Swidarski disputed the assertion that Diebold's systems are vulnerable to tampering. Before each election, he said, the software goes through rigorous testing and certification by one of three companies contracted through the National Association of State Election Directors. Those companies ''go through every line of code,'' he said. ''It's an extensive process that takes several months, and then the machines go for testing at the state level.''

Critics say that the certification process is not as thorough as the companies would have people believe, and that the resulting reports, like the technology, are not available for public inspection. This opacity is what worries detractors most. ''We know from Enron and WorldCom that when accounting is weak, crooks have been known to take over,'' Professor Jones said. ''If vulnerabilities exist in any voting system for a long enough time, someone's going to exploit it.'' **Correction:** November 16, 2003, Sunday An article last Sunday about Diebold Inc., which supplies touch-screen voting machines through a subsidiary, referred imprecisely to the way Walden W.

The documentary \"Buena Vista Social Club,\" which reignited the faded popularity of Cuban music, had helped make the island a trendy vacation spot. But Burks may have the distinction of being the first U.S. tourist prosecuted for violating Cuba travel restrictions. It has been 11 years since Congress established the right to civil hearings for those accused of violating U.S. regulations. Although thousands of people have been threatened with prosecution and many have paid fines in the $3,000-$7,500 range to settle, no judges were ever assigned and no cases pursued against those who refused to pay up. Until now. The Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control, acting on President George W. Bush's orders that Cuba travel restrictions be more vigorously enforced, recently hired three administrative law judges to hear cases. Burks' case number is 03T001 -- the first to be called. \"This is what I get for being honest,\" said Burks, who, unlike many, declared his visit to the island on a U.S. Customs form upon his return. \"I didn't even really know it was illegal to go to Cuba when I went.\" Burks said his girlfriend suggested the trip after she fell in love with the island portrayed in \"Buena Vista Social Club,\" the sweet story of aging musicians who gain worldwide fame. Burks called a few American airlines and was simply told they didn't have any flights to Cuba, so the duo decided to bag the trip and vacation in Mexico instead. While in Yucatan in December 1999, the pair noticed ads for cheap flights to Havana and decided to take one. Burks said he did buy a guidebook before leaving that said even though it wasn't illegal to travel to Cuba, it was illegal for Americans to spend money there. But the guidebook also noted no one was ever prosecuted, so they decided to take the 10-day trip. On their return flight from Mexico to Minneapolis, Burks and his girlfriend were separated and interrogated after revealing their visit to Cuba. Six months later, Burks received a notice he was facing a $7,590 fine. In the four years since the trip, the government has made several offers to settle for varying amounts, Burks said. At one point the Office of Foreign Assets Control -- which is charged with enforcing sanctions against foreign countries as well as terrorists and narcotics traffickers -- even agreed with an offer he made to settle for $250. But Burks, an Indonesian translator", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:031218oaklandtribunecubafredburks.txt:0:0f64adf108dc", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 7193, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "031218oaklandtribunecubafredburks.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "031218oaklandtribunecubafredburks", "chunk_index": 1, "text": "their visit to Cuba.

At one point the Office of Foreign Assets Control -- which is charged with enforcing sanctions against foreign countries as well as terrorists and narcotics traffickers -- even agreed with an offer he made to settle for $250. But Burks, an Indonesian translator who does contract work for the State Department -- and recently helped translate during Bush's visit to Bali -- had researched the situation and believed the political winds had shifted against enforcement of the travel restrictions. So he refused to settle. Since then, the politics have gone in the other direction, but he has decided to fight his case. Why of all the thousands of people who have travelled illegally to Cuba Burks' number came up is unclear. New York piano tuner Ben Treuhaft, an Oakland native who has openly mocked the Cuba sanctions and sent hundreds of used pianos to Cuba to replace old ones, at one point was threatened with $1.3 million in fines. He has repeatedly requested a hearing so he can use it to publicize contradictions in the policy, but never gotten one. The Treasury Department did not return phone calls seeking comment, but a spokesperson told the Associated Press action has begun in 90 cases. Of those, 37 people have settled, and the rest are moving forward. \"Why they are making (Burks) the poster child, I don't know,\" said Milwaukee attorney Art Heitzer, chairman of the National Lawyers Guild Cuba Subcommittee, who is helping Burks and others who have run afoul of the policy. \"But it's ridiculous to make him and his witnesses go all the way to Washington to prove his innocence.\" Heitzer said the law allows fines up to $65,000 per violation, but it's unclear whether Burks could face more than the original $7,590 fine. Burks is waiting for a hearing date. Former President John F. Kennedy first imposed sanctions against Cuba in 1963 in an attempt to isolate it. Travel restrictions eased somewhat during the Bill Clinton era. Both the Republican-led House and Senate voted to end the travel ban this fall, but the provision was later stripped from a larger bill after Bush threatened a veto. Bush is now tightening Cuba on all fronts. Berkeley lawyer Tom Miller suggested a small but powerful group of Cuban expatriates who have helped shape U.S. policy against Fidel Castro's socialist regime is influencing Bush. There are many ways for Americans to go to Cuba legally. Educational, research and humanitarian groups, as well as certain professionals such as physicians, journalists and politicians, can obtain licenses to visit.

Last year, 200,000 U.S. residents traveled to Cuba, including 110,000 Cuban Americans, 60,000 citizens with licenses, and about 30,000 who went illegally, according to Marazul, a New York charter company that tracks trips. The most popular license has been for \"people-to-people\" excursions, such as the educational trips sponsored by San Francisco-based Global Exchange. But those licenses are expiring Dec. 31, said Cuba program coordinator Ana Perez. \"After the end of the year we won't have a license to take people there. I have never felt more frustrated than I do now, dealing with the Treasury Department,\" said Perez, who is coordinating a trip for 160 people over the new year. \"Some of the conversations we have are ridiculous, like they said no biking in Cuba because it was a tourist activity, even though everyone in Cuba rides bikes.\" Last week, the Department of Homeland Security announced it had stepped up inspections of legal travelers to Cuba, searching 45,000 of the 54,000 passengers during the past two months. Inspectors did find 600 people violating the embargo, mostly by bringing back some extra rum or cigars, but concluded that 99 percent of people were complying.

Fred Burks? you ask. Yes, Fred Burks, that notorious Berkeley resident who in 1999 traveled to Cuba as a tourist because his girlfriend fell in love with the documentary \"Buena Vista Social Club.\" You know, that seditious film pretending to be about aging Cuban musicians. Burks, aka case No. 03T001, is in line to be the first U.S. tourist prosecuted by the U.S. Treasury Department for spending money in Cuba. Technically, it is not illegal to travel to Cuba, only to spend money there. Of course as a tourist, complying with that rule is highly improbable, if not impossible. Burks could be charged with naiveté. He told U.S. Customs he had taken a side trip to Cuba when returning from Mexico. But he could hardly be considered a threat or even a dissident. In fact, he does contract work for the U.S. State Department and translated during President Bush's trip to Bali. So why is the Treasury Department going after him with a $7,590 fine? No one seems to have a clear answer. Maybe his number just came up. A Treasury Department representative told reporters it was pursuing 90 cases; 37 of those had settled and the others were moving forward. Burks turned down a $250 settlement agreement because he thought the tide was turning against a hard line on Cuban travel. The tide was turning until Bush threatened to veto a vote to lift the travel restrictions approved by both the House and the Senate. Now, with the election coming up, appeasing Florida's hard line Cuban exile community is a priority. In addition, Bush's right-hand woman, National Security Adviser Condoleezza Rice, is known for her hard line on Cuba. So the Bush administration is tightening the screws on U.S. citizens who travel to Cuba. At the end of the year, the people-to-people trips arranged by non-profits will be eliminated. According to Global Exchange, one of the groups that conducted the tours, 30,000 citizens traveled to Cuba legally under the program. Education, humanitarian and research groups will still be able to make the trip and politicians, physicians and journalists will be eligible for licenses to visit Cuba. But even Americans going there legally are facing more scrutiny. The Department of Homeland Security proudly announced it had searched 45,000 of the 54,000 travelers returning from Cuba in the past two months. And what did it find? Communications with terrorist cells? Weapons of mass destruction? Contraband, even? It found 600 people who had violated", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:031219oaklandtribunecubaeditorial.txt:0:7b281d4f2368", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 7196, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "031219oaklandtribunecubaeditorial.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "031219oaklandtribunecubaeditorial", "chunk_index": 1, "text": "humanitarian and research groups will still be able to make the trip and politicians, physicians and journalists will be eligible for licenses to visit Cuba.

It found 600 people who had violated the restrictions of the embargo by bringing back too many cigars or bottles of rum. I feel so much safer knowing these excess cigars and bottles of rum have been confiscated. Don't you? And if a person is willing to sneak in extra cigars, who knows what he or she is likely to do to bring down the government. After searching 45,000 citizens, officials found violations in 1.3 percent of the cases. There's an efficient use of the time and resources of the Department of Homeland Security. Never mind that, as 9-11 demonstrated, there are actual terrorists plotting to harm U.S. citizens, and none of them has been linked in any way to Cuba. They would appear to be more focused on the Middle East. Ignore the point that Cuban dissidents opposing President Fidel Castro are against the embargo and travel restrictions, saying increased interaction will be more effective in undermining his regime. Forget that American businesses and farmers want the embargo dropped because they are being frozen out of the market in Cuba. Put all of this aside and cater to a small group of wealthy extremist Cuban exiles who've exerted unbelievable influence on U.S. Cuban policy for decades -- doesn't anyone remember how that community represented itself during the Elian Gonzalez crisis? That's sound foreign policy, looking out for the interests of the United States and its citizens. And don't lose sight of the threat posed by Fred Burks, that notorious Berkeley tourist who fell under the insidious influence of the seditious \"Buena Vista Social Club.\" Aging Cuban musicians, indeed. * Brenda Payton's column appears in the local section on Tuesdays and Fridays and on the opinion page on Sundays.*", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:031219oaklandtribunecubaeditorial.txt:1:176f18348f27", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 7197, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "040108latimescubaeditorial.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "040108latimescubaeditorial", "chunk_index": 0, "text": "Los Angeles Times: Cuba Case <!img alt=\"Los Angeles Times - Read the daily news at the LA Times, a California newspaper.

He didn't, and his trouble hasn't stopped. Coming back to the U.S. by way of Mexico, Burks acknowledged that he and his girlfriend had traveled to Cuba. They both like Cuban music and far-flung travel. Burks speaks four languages and has worked on contract for the State Department for years, in recent months translating for President Bush on a trip to Indonesia.** ** Although the Cuban Democracy Act of 1992 does not directly forbid Americans from traveling to Cuba, it does so indirectly. It bans spending money there, which before the law's passage had been forbidden by executive order. In this election year, the White House has enthusiastically opted to enforce the restrictions as a favor to conservative Cuban American voters in Florida. The Bush administration says money spent by American tourists fills Fidel Castro's coffers, propping up his oppressive regime. However, the administration allows Cuban Americans to send at least $1 billion annually to their relatives in the island. Such remittances from the United States are the No. 1 source of revenue for Cuba. Leading Cuban democracy activist Oswaldo Paya has welcomed tourists, urging \"all foreigners who visit our country to show solidarity, hold demonstrations and speak out for an opening in Cuba.\" Faced with these contradictions, many Americans have shrugged and boarded planes to Havana, often from Canada or Mexico. Out of the 150,000 or so Americans who visit the Caribbean island annually, about 130,000 are authorized by the U.S. government, including Cuban Americans, journalists, scientific researchers and people in other, often flimsy, special categories. Burks and his girlfriend got caught and, two years later, the U.S. Treasury Dept. fined them $7,590 each. Unwilling to continue struggling with government bureaucrats, the woman cut a deal and paid a $1,100 fine. Burks didn't. Burks is not alone in wanting to see the 1992 law changed. The House has passed bills to lift the ban on travel four times. The Senate did so once, last year. Businesspeople, academics and tourists argue that the policy is ineffective as well as unfair to U.S. travelers. Cuba's harsh crackdown on democracy advocates last year understandably slowed pressure to reform U.S. policy. But in the long", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:040108latimescubaeditorial.txt:0:cf8fd8685246", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 7198, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "040108latimescubaeditorial.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "040108latimescubaeditorial", "chunk_index": 1, "text": "the woman cut a deal and paid a $1,100 fine.

But in the long term, U.S. citizens who travel to the island increase the flow of ideas and democratic influence. Letting Fred Burks and thousands like him play tourist in Havana may not oust Fidel Castro. But it is certainly more in the spirit of freedom that the United States ought to embody.

As you might recall, there was some specific threats for overseas that we reacted to. And as the president, I wanted to know whether there was anything, any actionable intelligence. And I looked at the August 6th briefing, I was satisfied that some of the matters were being looked into. But** that PDB said nothing about an attack on America.** It talked about intentions, about somebody who hated America -- well, we knew that. **Question: **There was, in that PDB, specific information about activity that may speak to a larger battle plan, even if it wasn't specific. So I wonder if you could say what specifically was done, and do you think your administration should have done anything more? **Bush: **. . . Had I known there was going to be an attack on America, I would have moved mountains to stop the attack. I would have done everything I can. My job is to protect the American people. And I asked the intelligence agency to analyze the data to tell me whether or not we faced a threat internally . . .

Each precinct was listed as having 300 registered voters. That means the total number of voters for the county would be 22,200, although there are actually more than 79,000 registered voters. Vote counting resumed at about 9:30 p.m. Spevak said workers at the clerk's office thought a computer correction could be done once they received a software patch from Election Systems and Software, the Chicago company that provided the tabulation software. However, the patch did not work. \"We thought we could get a copy of it e-mailed file to us and start all over, but once the program was downloaded from Chicago, it still didn't work right,\" Spevak said. Spevak said the Board of Election was in contact with Indianapolis to see if they could certify the vote. She said Wednesday that LaPorte County election officials might have to manually input the information so that the ballots could be certified with the state.

Records show only 638 voters cast ballots in that precinct. Bush actually received 365 votes in the precinct, Matthew Damschroder, director of the Franklin County Board of Elections, told The Columbus Dispatch. State and county election officials did not immediately respond to requests by The Associated Press for more details about the voting system and its vendor, and whether the error, if repeated elsewhere in Ohio, could have affected the outcome. Bush won the state by more than 136,000 votes, according to unofficial results, and Kerry conceded the election on Wednesday after acknowledging that 155,000 provisional ballots yet to be counted in Ohio would not change the result. ([Full Ohio results](ELECTION2004pagesresultsstatesOHP00index.html)) The Secretary of State's Office said Friday it could not revise Bush's total until the county reported the error. The Ohio glitch is among a handful of computer troubles that have emerged since Tuesday's elections. ([Touchscreen voting troubles reported)](2004TECH1103electronic.voting.apindex.html) In one North Carolina county, more than 4,500 votes were lost because officials mistakenly believed a computer that stored ballots electronically could hold more data than it did. And in San Francisco, a malfunction with custom voting software could delay efforts to declare the winners of four races for county supervisor. In the Ohio precinct in question, the votes are recorded onto a cartridge. On one of the three machines at that precinct, a malfunction occurred in the recording process, Damschroder said. He could not explain how the malfunction occurred. Damschroder said people who had seen poll results on the election board's Web site called to point out the discrepancy. The error would have been discovered when the official count for the election is performed later this month, he said. The reader also recorded zero votes in a county commissioner race on the machine.

Workers checked the cartridge against memory banks in the voting machine and each showed that 115 people voted for Bush on that machine. With the other machines, the total for Bush in the precinct added up to 365 votes. Meanwhile, in San Francisco, a glitch occurred with software designed for the city's new \"ranked-choice voting,\" in which voters list their top three choices for municipal offices. If no candidate gets a majority of first-place votes outright, voters' second and third-place preferences are then distributed among candidates who weren't eliminated in the first round. ([E-vote goes smoothly, but experts skeptical](/)) When the San Francisco Department of Elections tried a test run on Wednesday of the program that does the redistribution, some of the votes didn't get counted and skewed the results, director John Arntz said. \"All the information is there,\" Arntz said. \"It's just not arriving the way it was supposed to.\" A technician from the Omaha, Neb. company that designed the software, Election Systems & Software Inc., was working to diagnose and fix the problem.

Ohio election officials said Monday that they would begin this week the final count of 155,428 provisional ballots and an unknown number of overseas absentee ballots that were cast in the presidential election. According to the preliminary tally, which included all domestic absentee ballots, Sen. John F. Kerry lost Ohio by 136,483 votes, Secretary of State J. Kenneth Blackwell said. Attorneys for the Kerry campaign said Monday that they did not believe the outcome of the Ohio vote -- which gave President Bush the electoral votes needed to win -- could possibly change; they have discouraged speculation that voting irregularities caused Kerry's loss. Nonetheless, the Ohio count is attracting scrutiny by groups who say the election was tainted and that voting equipment in Ohio, Florida, South Carolina and elsewhere was defective. On Friday, three congressional Democrats asked for a federal investigation. Since the election, Internet sites and political blogs have buzzed with speculation that the vote was manipulated. \"Evidence mounts that the vote may have been hacked,\" reads the title of one widely circulated Web offering. Voting machine failures did occur, and long lines in heavily Democratic precincts discouraged some potential voters. Still, a broad range of experts said that the final vote counts in Ohio and other states could not possibly change the outcome. Among those was Cleveland attorney Mark Griffin, who played a key role in the Kerry campaign's voter protection efforts in that area. After meeting Monday with Michael Vu, head of the Board of Elections in Ohio's Cuyahoga County, Griffin said: \"This is really not about changing the outcome.... It is about making sure every vote counts, particularly people who waited in line three hours.\" The 2004 Ohio vote was not nearly as close as the disputed Florida results in 2000. If all provisional votes are deemed valid, Kerry would need 88% of them to overcome Bush's margin of victory in Ohio, assuming the remaining overseas absentee ballots were split evenly. But many provisional ballots will probably be tossed out. In past elections,", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:041109latimes.txt:0:0f5963e44895", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 7207, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "041109latimes.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "041109latimes", "chunk_index": 1, "text": "really not about changing the outcome....

If all provisional votes are deemed valid, Kerry would need 88% of them to overcome Bush's margin of victory in Ohio, assuming the remaining overseas absentee ballots were split evenly. But many provisional ballots will probably be tossed out. In past elections, about 10% were judged as not coming from legitimately registered voters. What's more, Blackwell ruled before the election that provisional ballots had to be cast in the correct precinct, and that any cast at the wrong polling place would not be counted. If 10% of the provisional ballots were rejected, Kerry would need to get 97.6% of those remaining to overcome Bush's lead. \"There are a lot of conspiracy theory folks out there thinking that -- with a machine problem here and a long-line problem there and the provisional ballots -- the result is in doubt,\" said Edward J. Foley, a professor at Ohio State University's Moritz College of Law. \"I have seen nothing to indicate that the result is in doubt.\" But, Foley said, the election revealed problems that needed to be remedied. Counting of the provisional ballots is expected to begin Saturday, although state law allows counties to delay the canvass until Nov. 18, said James Lee, Secretary of State spokesman. Ohio, however, faces a Dec. 7 deadline to finish this process so that its electors can cast their electoral college votes Dec. 13. Under state law, each county will examine its provisional ballots, which are in sealed envelopes. Before opening the envelopes, a team of elections officials -- split evenly between declared Democrats and Republicans -- will decide whether the voter who cast the ballot was registered by the early October deadline and voted in the correct precinct. After all provisional ballots have been allowed or rejected, the envelopes will be opened, Lee said. \"Our system is designed to be bipartisan in every aspect,\" he said. But irregularities and problems have cropped up nonetheless. On Friday, officials in Franklin County -- which includes state capital Columbus -- acknowledged that they may have improperly counted votes for Bush because of a touch-screen voting system malfunction. A precinct in the county reported that a 4,000-vote margin won by Bush appeared to exceed the number of registered voters. The touch-screen system in Franklin County is among the oldest and least reliable electronic voting machines in use, said David Dill, a Stanford University computer expert. Asked how an electronic voting machine could run up nearly 4,000 extra votes, Dill said a variety of factors, including an internal misalignment or static electricity, could cause such an error. \"The point is that these machines are nowhere near reliable enough to depend on,\" Dill", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:041109latimes.txt:1:05dd40739660", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 7208, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "041109latimes.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "041109latimes", "chunk_index": 2, "text": "appeared to exceed the number of registered voters.

Based on reports that Dill's organization -- Verified Voting.org - - has received, one precinct in Youngstown, Ohio, recorded a negative 25 million votes, which was discarded from official results. And it was widely reported after Nov. 2 that a North Carolina precinct lost 4,000 votes when a recording device used up all its memory but voters continued to cast ballots on the machine.

The section about the CIA being stopped from eliminating bin Laden has been highlighted with bold face.** **Why I Resigned From the CIA** **The agency did its job, but higher-ups endangered the nation. By Michael Scheuer ** * Michael Scheuer, a 22-year veteran of the CIA, wrote \"Imperial Hubris: Why the West is Losing the War on Terror\" (Brassey's Inc., 2004) under the pseudonym Anonymous.* The Central Intelligence Agency is the best place to work in the United States. No federal agency has a smarter, more dedicated or harder-working set of individuals than the CIA's women and men. I had intended to work at the CIA for the duration of my career, and I left it with deep regret and a great sense of personal loss. I was neither forced out nor pressed to resign. Resigning was my decision alone. I cannot state these facts more clearly, and I fiercely deny the accusations that I am a disgruntled former employee. I am, however, a disgruntled American - one who decided that being a good citizen was no longer compatible with being a good member of the CIA's Senior Intelligence Service. I do not profess a broad expertise in international affairs, but **between January 1996 and June 1999 I was in charge of running operations against Al Qaeda from Washington. When it comes to this small slice of the large U.S. national security pie, I speak with firsthand experience (and for several score of CIA officers) when I state categorically that during this time [senior White House officials](#officials) repeatedly refused to act on sound intelligence that provided multiple chances to eliminate Osama bin Laden - either by capture or by U.S. military attack.** I witnessed and documented, along with dozens of other CIA officers, instances where life-risking intelligence-gathering work of the agency's men and women in the field was wasted. Because of classification issues, I argued this point only obliquely in my book \"Imperial Hubris,\" but it is a fact - and fortunately, no American has to depend on my word alone.

Because of classification issues, I argued this point only obliquely in my book \"Imperial Hubris,\" but it is a fact - and fortunately, no American has to depend on my word alone. The 9/11 commission report documents most of the occasions on which senior U.S. bureaucrats and policymakers had the chance to attack Bin Laden in 1998-1999. It is mystifying that the American public has not been outraged over these missed opportunities. In the most memorable and cloying moment of the 9/11 commission's public hearings, former White House terrorism advisor Richard Clarke apologized to the American people for the failure of the U.S. intelligence community to protect them. This statement has become, like the 9/11 report, American scripture - carved in stone, literally true and unquestionable. Clearly, Clarke had the duty to apologize for the government's ineffectiveness as regards terrorism, but I reject his intimation that the clandestine service failed the nation. Now, I must add that I was never charged with deciding whether to act against Bin Laden. That decision properly belongs solely to senior White House officials. However, as a now-private American citizen, it is my right to question their judgment; I am entitled to know why the protection of Americans - most selfishly, my own children and grandchildren - was not the top priority of the senior officials who refused to act on the opportunities to attack Bin Laden provided by the clandestine service. Each of these officials have publicly argued that the intelligence was not \"good enough\" to act, but they almost always neglect to say that they were repeatedly advised that the intelligence was not going to get better and that Bin Laden was going to kill thousands of Americans if he was not stopped. At each opportunity provided by the clandestine service, senior bureaucrats and policymakers decided not to act. The 9/11 report documents the fact that the chances to capture or attack Bin Laden were passed by because there were worries that shrapnel might hit a mosque and offend Muslim opinion; that a United Arab Emirates prince meeting Bin Laden clandestinely in the Afghan desert might be killed; and that the CIA might be accused of assassination if Bin Laden was killed in an effort to capture him. Of course, it is not my opinion but that of the American people that counts. **Perhaps a starting point is for Americans to ask why no member of Congress' Graham-Goss investigation or the Kean-Hamilton commissioners ever directly asked Clarke, former national security advisor Samuel R. \"Sandy\" Berger, CIA Director George J. Tenet, former FBI Director Louis J. Freeh, former Secretary of State William S. Cohen or", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:041205latimes.txt:1:aae2a058a0fe", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 7211, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "041205latimes.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "041205latimes", "chunk_index": 2, "text": "accused of assassination if Bin Laden was killed in an effort to capture him.

Tenet, former FBI Director Louis J. Freeh, former Secretary of State William S. Cohen or any of the rest of the witnesses why they never erred on the side of protecting Americans; why international opinion was ultimately more important than the Americans who leaped from the World Trade Center; and why the intelligence was \"good enough\" to save the life of an Arab prince dining with bin Laden, but not \"good enough\" to cause the government to act on behalf of Americans.** At day's end, it may be worth pausing the intelligence reform process long enough to determine what role personal failure, bureaucratic warfare - which the Department of Defense continues waging today - and a lack of moral courage played in getting the United States to 9/11. Lacking this accounting, the debate over intelligence reform will, I believe, simply lock into place a bureaucratic mind-set that believes intelligence is never \"good enough\" to take a risk to protect the lives of Americans.
