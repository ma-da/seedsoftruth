Any technology can be used for the greater good or for selfish greed and control. I know that, unfortunately, there are those who are eager to use this technology to control us for their own benefit. Don't be surprised to see an increasing number of articles convincing us that this microchip implanting is a very beneficial technology to which we eventually should all submit. At this stage of humanity, I don't think it is wise to trust our government to implant chips inside of us which have capabilities of which we are unaware. I look forward to the day when this powerful technology is used for the good of all. **I encourage you to read our summary at [www.WantToKnow.info/mindcontrol10pg](https://www.WantToKnow.info/mindcontrol10pg) for more information on this important subject. **By educating ourselves, we can more effectively work to build a brighter future.

Could Denzel Washington's \"creepy\" comment be considered a case of thriller-induced paranoia? Could he be taking his movie role a tad too seriously? After all, it's clear that microchip technology, despite fears of Big brother monitoring and other sinister applications, will improve countless lives. Remembering that this journey began, to some degree, [in collaboration with Nazis](http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1141/is_42_39/ai_108838279), it's wise to remain somewhat suspicious. With that in mind, here is a brief history of the technology of the future: **1950**: Robert G. Heath and Dr. Russell Moore, funded largely by the U.S. military and the CIA, experiment with mind manipulation by [inserting up to 125 electrodes into subjects' brains (alongside drugs such as LSD)](http://www.geocities.com/skews_me/implants.html). Heath also suggests that lobotomies be performed on patients, not for therapeutic reasons, but for the convenience of the hospital staff. **1953:** John Lilly, of the National Institute of Mental Health, discovers that he can simulate a variety of emotions by placing electrodes inside a monkey's brain. (A male monkey, for example, when given a switch to prompt orgasm, pushes the button approximately every three minutes.) Lilly's work draws the CIA's attention and is later described in John Marks's *The Search for the \"Manchurian Candidate\": The CIA and Mind Control (1979)* and George Andrews's *MKULTRA: The CIA's Top Secret Program in Human Experimentation and Behavior Modification* (2001).

The message is posted at [this link](https://www.WantToKnow.info/powerofnightmares) for those who might have missed it. Here I would like to share with you more of my own experience, and the inspiring story of how this led to my becoming a celebrity for a week after recently giving testimony in the most prominent court case in Indonesia. First and foremost, I have no doubt that it is my openness to divine guidance which has brought these and so many other unexpected miracles into my life. My deepest commitment for my entire adult life has always been to what's best for all.** I continually ask for divine guidance in [choosing what's best for all](https://www.weboflove.org/keystolife) as I move through my life. **I also surrender to God's will and fully trust that I am continually guided to what's best for all. You can read the inspiring story filled with little miracles of how this deep commitment led to my becoming the top Indonesian interpreter at the US Department of State by [clicking here](https://www.WantToKnow.info/051119fredburkspresidentialinterpreter). For a brief background to the story of my week as a celebrity, Indonesia is the fourth largest nation in the world with a population of over 225 million. It is estimated that over 80% of Indonesians are Muslim, yet these warm people are known for their tolerance and respect of other religions. When I lived there for a full year with a wonderful Muslim family back in 1981, on Easter day I joined the whole family as they jumped into their car to visit and pay respects to all of their Christian friends on this most important Christian holiday. Almost all Indonesian Muslims follow this tradition, just as Christians in Indonesia pay respects to their Muslim friends on the most important Muslim Holiday Idul Fitri. Before 9/11, most Indonesians liked and supported both the American government and people. Whenever I visited Indonesia, friends and new acquaintances there almost always spoke very positively of the US. Immediately after 9/11 there was a huge outpouring of sympathy from all of my Indonesian friends, who sent very kind emails expressing support to our grief-stricken nation. When the US invaded Afghanistan, however, a few there began to question US motives behind this attack. But **it was during the lead up to the war on Iraq and the following invasion that Indonesian support of the US began to drastically change.** Many of you know that reporting on the war in Iraq in the US was quite one-sided.

The *New York Times *and *Washington Post *even belatedly published official apologies for not reporting significant news which questioned this war. European countries were more balanced in their reporting, while Muslim countries generally were biased against the US in their reporting on Iraq. Many Muslims felt that through deciding to invade this predominantly Muslim nation without the support of the UN, the US had clearly gone too far, especially when the claimed reason for the attack turned out to be bogus. **Indonesian Muslims, like Muslims around the world, increasingly felt that their religion was being targeted, as it was continually linked to terrorism.** **Given this background, you can understand why Indonesians were interested in my testimony in the highly publicized case of Abu Bakar Basyir.** In court, I testified to personally witnessing heavy pressure by the US government put on Indonesian President Megawati Soekarnoputri to secretly capture and turn Basyir over to US authorities. Though US authorities have [repeatedly denied](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/asia-pacific/4170629.stm) ever putting any pressure on Jakarta to act against Ba'asyir (even after my testimony), many Indonesians have believed all along that Basyir was being scapegoated and falsely made out to be a terrorist in order to further turn public opinion against Muslims. Basyir is a fundamentalist Muslim who has spoken out harshly against US and international intervention. He advocates incorporating religious law into Indonesian government. He is something like a Jerry Falwell or Pat Robertson in the US, fundamentalist Christians who speak out against evil in governments around the world, and who want the US to be run on religious principles. **The vast majority of Indonesians do not agree with Basyir's principles. He does not have a large following there. But they do believe strongly in justice and democracy.** Few in Indonesia believe that Basyir is a terrorist, or that he has advocated violence. The reason his case has become the most highest publicized legal case in Indonesia is that most Indonesians suspect the whole case is being manipulated by the US and powerful, international elite groups. The team of lawyers representing Abu Bakar Basyir numbers close to 100. Yet most of these attorneys are moderate Muslims, with a few even from other religions. They are defending him pro bono--free of charge. They do this not because they agree with his beliefs, but rather because **they see how international intervention has resulted in this man being **unfairly** made out to be", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:050129fredburkscelebrity.txt:1:dde6889f6f5c", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 7221, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "050129fredburkscelebrity.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "050129fredburkscelebrity", "chunk_index": 2, "text": "Indonesians suspect the whole case is being manipulated by the US and powerful, international elite groups.

They do this not because they agree with his beliefs, but rather because **they see how international intervention has resulted in this man being **unfairly** made out to be an evil terrorist, based on evidence which does not hold up in court.** And so it was that in court on January 13th, in front of hundreds in the audience and dozens of reporters, I described my experience as a US State Department interpreter at a [secret meeting](https://www.WantToKnow.info/050228secretmeeting) in the home of the Indonesian president Megawati Soekarnoputri. In this meeting, I witnessed a personal envoy of President Bush, supported by US ambassador to Indonesia Ralph Boyce and National Security Council expert Karen Brooks, put heavy pressure on Megawati to secretly capture and turn over Basyir. The reasons given were based solely on the testimony of Omar Al-Faruq, a suspected terrorist who had previously been secretly turned over to the US. President Megawati resisted the pressure, even stating, \"I hope this does not lead to a severing of the good relations between our two countries.\" **I had known that my testimony might make the news, but I was stunned at the extensive coverage given. It was simply miraculous! Walking out of the court room, I was surrounded by a sea of reporters who wanted to know more.** Most Indonesians had thought that Americans did not like Muslims and supported the war on terror. One reporter asked: \"As an American, why are you supporting an Indonesian targeted by the US government?\" I responded, \"Many Americans do not support the recent wars and targeting of Muslims. As an American citizen, I am one of many who highly value respect and cooperation among all peoples and countries.\" Another reporter asked if I wasn't betraying my country in revealing state secrets. I told them about the important role of whistleblowers, people who reveal government manipulations which clearly are not in the interests of the country or world.** I explained how whistleblowers are seen as heroes, to be commended for their bravery in exposing corruption in high places.** I also told this eager audience about my work as manager of the successful website [WantToKnow.info](https://www.WantToKnow.info), which provides reliable, verifiable information on major cover-ups of which few people are aware. They wanted to know what else I knew. I told them about my deep commitment to what's best for all people, and how this is what guides my life and all that I do. Asked about concern for my own safety in revealing these sensitive secrets, I told them \"I have very little fear, because I trust that", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:050129fredburkscelebrity.txt:2:ce081fa7e50f", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 7222, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "050129fredburkscelebrity.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "050129fredburkscelebrity", "chunk_index": 3, "text": "work as manager of the successful website [WantToKnow.info](https://www.WantToKnow.info), which provides reliable, verifiable information on major cover-ups of which few people are aware.

Asked about concern for my own safety in revealing these sensitive secrets, I told them \"I have very little fear, because I trust that I am always guided by God to whatever is best. I'm prepared even to die whenever it is my time, though I trust that I am here to do some important work.\" It was miraculous to me to be able to share how my own deep faith and commitment brought me to this place. News of my testimony was broadcast on all of Indonesia's major TV stations. National newspapers (and many international papers) the next day carried articles on the American who exposed secret manipulations of his government. These articles generated even more interest in both my testimony and what caused me to be willing to testify. And so my remaining four days in Jakarta were filled with press interviews and invitations to speak at important institutions. **I ended up on prime-time TV with one of the most respected news hosts in the country sharing my commitment to help all peoples work together for the good of all. Another miracle! ** I was invited to give a talk at one of the country's most prestigious research institutions and several other respected venues. The deputy chairman of the Indonesia's parliament stood up at one of my talks to inform everyone that he had cleared his busy schedule to come hear me speak, because he had heard that here was someone who was speaking deep truths. Another miracle! He even half-seriously offered me political asylum should I need it. I helped this prominent politician and many other influential Indonesians (and even a few foreigners) to see that it is not that the American people and government are targeting Islam. It is corrupt individuals within government and among the power elite who are [using fear to forward their own selfish agendas](https://www.WantToKnow.info/brighterfuture), and who are manipulating public perception of Islam. These elite groups are [profiting handsomely](https://www.WantToKnow.info/warcoverup) from the wars waged. Bringing the message even deeper, I invited everyone to whom I talked to examine where each of us is pointing the finger of blame at other groups or individuals without examining our own involvement. I invited all to see how we are allowing ourselves to become polarized. Christians and Jews are increasing led to be suspicious of our Muslim brothers and sisters, while Muslims, in turn, are led to be angry and suspicious of the US and its allies. **I encouraged everyone to remember that we are all doing our best, that we are", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:050129fredburkscelebrity.txt:3:9b197aaf6adc", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 7223, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "050129fredburkscelebrity.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "050129fredburkscelebrity", "chunk_index": 4, "text": "where each of us is pointing the finger of blame at other groups or individuals without examining our own involvement.

I don't mean to preach to anyone, but with all the national press attention, I was thrilled to have this powerful opportunity to remind the people of an entire nation that we are all beautiful people worthy of love, honor, and respect, and that we can choose to work together for the good of all. I clearly felt the presence of the divine in providing me this miraculous opportunity to invite us all to join together in working for the greater good. And the response was tremendous! Numerous articles were published daily on both my testimony and my talks. Calls poured in for interviews and invitations to talk. In addition to the prime time TV appearance, I was interviewed for an hour on one of the nation's most popular radio programs. I had reporters with me almost everywhere I went. I was truly a celebrity for a week. What a miracle! On my way home in the Jakarta airport, several people recognized me and thanked me for all I had done. **As I stepped up to the currency exchange window to transfer my remaining rupiah into dollars, the clerk took one look at me and said, \"You're Fred Burks! Thank you!\" ** It was very strange and completely unexpected to become famous for one week. Given the choice, I would definitely rather not be famous, because you can't go anywhere without people wanting to talk with you. However, it was truly a lot of fun to have fame for just one week in Indonesia. Now I'm glad to be back home, leading a much more anonymous life again. There are many other little miracles to this led up to this story. Though my testimony was strong, it was made even stronger by the testimony of two of Indonesia's most respected leaders. This was Basyir's second trial. Two years earlier, he had been found innocent of any terrorism charges, yet he was jailed for a year and a half (largely in response to intense international pressure) on immigration violations. **When Basyir was due to be released, US Ambassador Ralph Boyce", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:050129fredburkscelebrity.txt:4:082b31a87cee", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 7224, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "050129fredburkscelebrity.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "050129fredburkscelebrity", "chunk_index": 5, "text": "are many other little miracles to this led up to this story.

Two years earlier, he had been found innocent of any terrorism charges, yet he was jailed for a year and a half (largely in response to intense international pressure) on immigration violations. **When Basyir was due to be released, US Ambassador Ralph Boyce separately approached two of the top religious leaders in the nation. He privately pressured them use their influence to convince the Supreme Court and police to keep Basyir in jail or rearrest him.** Basyir was, in fact, rearrested immediately upon release, but one of these religious leaders testified on the same day as my testimony to being pressured by Boyce. After our testimony, the other well-known leader acknowledged that he, too, had been pressured by Ambassador Boyce. **So the continued denial by US authorities of any pressure in this case was in direct contradiction not only to my testimony, but also to that of prominent public leaders known and respected throughout Indonesia. Another little miracle.** Then there is the story of how I ended up coming to testify. When I first started talking openly about this secret meeting two months ago, I didn't even know that Basyir was on trial for a second time. The reason I revealed this information is that [I had recently resigned](https://www.WantToKnow.info/fredburksresigns) from the State Department largely because of excessive new requirements for secrecy. As I had never taken a secrecy oath, I felt no obligation to keep this information secret after my resignation, particularly as what was being requested in this meeting was a violation of international law. I mentioned the secret meeting to a reporter who was interested in writing an article on my resignation. His [article in the*Washington Post*](https://www.WantToKnow.info/fredburksresignspost) included one paragraph about the Basyir meeting. One of the main lawyers on Basyir's team, a wonderful man named A.W. Wirawan, contacted me by email as a result of this article. When Mr. Wirawan asked if I would come to Indonesia to testify to what I had witnessed, I was surprised, but eventually agreed. As I knew Basyir's attorneys were all working for free and would have to pay for my visit out of their own pockets, I told Mr. Wirawan that I would be willing to stay in someone's home to save them money. I should mention that the lead lawyer on Basyir's team is one of the most famous and respected lawyers in all of Indonesia, Adnan Buyung Nasution. He founded Indonesia's Legal Aid Society and has defended a number of the most important court cases in Indonesia's history. The day after I sent the email offering to stay in someone's home,** I received an email from Mr. Wirawan informing me that", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:050129fredburkscelebrity.txt:5:24d68da15860", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 7225, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "050129fredburkscelebrity.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "050129fredburkscelebrity", "chunk_index": 6, "text": "be willing to stay in someone's home to save them money.

The day after I sent the email offering to stay in someone's home,** I received an email from Mr. Wirawan informing me that I would be staying in the home of the famous Mr. Nasution! Another miracle!** In my time there, Mr. Nasution, his wonderful wife, several members of the legal team, and I had a wonderful time getting to know each other and sharing inspiring stories and important information. They were so happy with my testimony and all the press attention it drew that they threw a special going away celebration for me on my last evening at Mr. Nasution's beautiful home. Besides inviting the legal team and several prominent Indonesians to this celebration, Mr. Nasution decided to invite Megawati. It was a long shot, but the legal team had thought getting me to come testify was a long shot, too.** Sure enough, (now former) President Megawati gave us the great honor of coming to my going away celebration! Another miracle!!! **She had appreciated my interpreting and warm manner in the several times I had worked with her. She also clearly supported my court testimony, though she was reluctant to say so publicly. Megawati and I ended up having a great talk at this celebration. She even gave me the phone number of one of the Americans at that secret meeting, her long-time personal friend Karen Brooks of the National Security Council. Though I was never sworn to secrecy as an interpreter, and therefore was not breaking any laws in revealing these secrets, I had made a personal promise to Ms. Brooks over that phone not to reveal the contents of this meeting. I wanted to apologize to her and explain my reasoning for revealing this important information (she hasn't yet responded to my calls and messages). So to have Ms. Megawati, the former president of Indonesia, give me Ms. Brooks phone number helped me to clear the only regret I had about the whole amazing week in Indonesia. What a wonderful way to end a trip full of miracles! I am extremely thankful to my spiritual guidance and to all of the people who helped to make my trip and testimony such a miraculous journey.

The sulfur dioxide that poured out of the refinery had made a desolate wasteland out of what used to be a beautiful forest. When a young visitor one day looked at this wasteland and saw that there was nothing living there - no animals, no trees, no grass, no bushes, no birds ... nothing but fourteen thousand acres of black and barren land that even smelled bad - well, this kid looked at the land and said, \"This place is crummy.\" Little Paul knocked him down. He felt insulted. But he looked around him and something happened inside him. He made a decision: Paul Rokich vowed that some day he would bring back the life to this land. Years later Paul was in the area, and he went to the smelter office. He asked if they had any plans to bring the trees back. The answer was \"No.\" He asked if they would let him try to bring the trees back. Again, the answer was \"No.\" They didn't want him on their land. He realized he needed to be more knowledgeable before anyone would listen to him, so he went to college to study botany. At the college he met a professor who was an expert in Utah's ecology. Unfortunately, this expert told Paul that the wasteland he wanted to bring back was beyond hope. He was told that his goal was foolish because even if he planted trees, and even if they grew, the wind would only blow the seeds forty feet per year, and that's all you'd get because there weren't any birds or squirrels to spread the seeds, and the seeds from those trees would need another thirty years before they started producing seeds of their own.", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:050205willpoweryieldsforests.txt:0:c07f43ff3834", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 7228, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "050205willpoweryieldsforests.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "050205willpoweryieldsforests", "chunk_index": 1, "text": "this expert told Paul that the wasteland he wanted to bring back was beyond hope.

Therefore, it would take approximately twenty thousand years to revegetate that six-square-mile piece of earth. So he tried to go on with his life. He got a job operating heavy equipment, got married, and had some kids. But his dream would not die. He kept studying up on the subject, and he kept thinking about it. And then one night, Paul looked at what opportunities were right in front of him. He decided to get up and take some action. He would what he could with what he had. This was an important turning point. Under the cover of darkness, he sneaked out into the wasteland with a backpack full of seedlings and started planting. For seven hours he planted seedlings. He did it again a week later. And every week, he made his secret journey into the wasteland and planted trees and shrubs and grass. But most of it died. For fifteen years he did this. When a whole valley of his fir seedlings burned to the ground because of a careless sheepherder, Paul broke down and wept. Then he got up and kept planting. Freezing winds and blistering heat, landslides and floods and fires destroyed his work time and time again. But he kept planting. One night he found a highway crew had come and taken tons of dirt for a road grade, and all the plants he had painstakingly planted in that area were gone. But he just kept planting. Week after week, year after year he kept at it, against the opinion of the authorities, against the trespassing laws, against the devastation of road crews, against the wind and rain and heat ... even against plain common sense. He just kept planting. Slowly, very slowly, things began to take root. Then gophers appeared. Then rabbits. Then porcupines. Eventually, the old copper smelter saw the results and gave him permission to plant. Then later, as times were changing and there was political pressure to clean up the environment, the company actually hired Paul to do what he was already doing, and they provided him with machinery and crews to work with. Progress accelerated. Now the place is fourteen thousand acres of trees and grass and bushes, rich with elk and eagles, and Paul Rokich has received almost every environmental award Utah has. Recently, Paul mused on his long decades of dedicated work, \"I thought that if I", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:050205willpoweryieldsforests.txt:1:b5f6bce925e1", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 7229, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "050205willpoweryieldsforests.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "050205willpoweryieldsforests", "chunk_index": 2, "text": "changing and there was political pressure to clean up the environment, the company actually hired Paul to do what he was already doing, and they provided him with machinery and crews to work with.

Recently, Paul mused on his long decades of dedicated work, \"I thought that if I got this started, when I was dead and gone people would come and see it. I never thought I'd live to see it myself!\" It took him until his hair turned white, but he managed to keep that impossible vow he made to himself as a child. **What was it you wanted to do that you thought was impossible?** Paul's story sure gives a perspective on things, doesn't it? The way you get something accomplished in this world is to just keep planting. Just keep working. Just keep plugging away at it one day at a time for a long time, no matter who criticizes you, no matter how long it takes, no matter how many times you fall. Get back up again. And just keep planting.

In March 2001 - two months after the recording showed how the Nevada plant was shut down - [Enron CEO Kenneth] Lay called any claims of market manipulation 'conspiracy theories.'\" **Accusations of \"conspiracy theory\" too often are thrown around when investigators start exposing sensitive truths. Energy plays a decisive role in quest for power and profits. Manipulations around energy have been going on for many decades. Without gasoline and electricity, what would our lives be like? The power elite know how to take advantage of our dependence upon energy to make huge profits. The California power crisis is but one glaring example. **For an excellent summary of the major cover-ups around energy, [click here](https://www.WantToKnow.info/newenergysources).** As yet another example, it is clear now that pretext of weapons of mass destruction for the War in Iraq was largely fabricated. **Could it be that the real reason for the war involved energy, i.e. to secure the second largest oil reserves in the world?** I invite you to search \"oil company profits\" on your favorite search engine. While our young men and women sacrifice themselves in Iraq, the oil companies rake in the profits. And though the media are reporting the soaring oil profits, why do they make practically no effort to link them to the war? **For more on who really profits in wars, take a look at the powerful essay by a highly decorated US general titled [War is a Racket](https://www.WantToKnow.info/warcoverup).** Please help to educate your friends and colleagues by spreading this important news.

But the danger didn't stop Enron's energy traders from having a good laugh. CBS News Correspondent Vince Gonzales reports on the Enron scheme, as caught on new audio tape. **The traders and plant operator laugh and plot in a display that seems to prove the theory that years before the energy crisis, Enron manipulated markets. ** \"They had to do a rolling blackout through the town and there was a red light there he didn't see,\" one Enron trader says on tape. \"That's beautiful,\" a second voice responds. \"I'm like, this is causing animosity throughout the state now,\" the first says. \"Cars are blowing up.\" **The new tapes - routinely recorded by Enron to protect their own deals and later obtained by this small utility in Washington state - confirm what CBS News has been reporting for four years: That Enron secretly shut power plants down so they could cause, and then cash in on, the crisis.** \"Ah, we want you guys to get a little creative...\" one voice says on the tape. \"OK,\" a plant operator replies. \"...and come up with a reason to go down,\" the first man finishes his sentence. **Plant operators were coached on how to lie to officials.** \"Just call 'em, Hey guys...we're coming down,\" one Enron trader says. The plant operator replies, \"OK, so we're just comin' down for some maintenance, like a forced outage type thing?\" \"Right,\" the trader says. \"And that's cool?\" the plant operator asks. \"Hopefully,\" the trader responds, to which the men are heard laughing. **Enron also pulled power out of states like California, causing emergency conditions to worsen.** **\"Sorry California,\" an Enron trader says. \"I'm bringing all our power out of state today. I moved out six - over six hundred megawatts.\" ** **The \"shut downs\" and \"pull outs\" triggered sky high power prices. ** **\"We're just making money hand over fist!\" one voice is heard saying on the tape.** And when states complained, the guys at Enron seemed to have a response. \"Get a f****** clue,\" one says. \"Yeah,\" another chimes in. \"Leave us alone. Let us make a little bit of money.\" \"Exactly,\" says another trader. But when the schemes began to unravel, employees blamed the men running Enron. \"I told you they were all crooks,\" one Enron employee is heard saying. \"I just didn't know how much.\" \"As far as I'm concerned,", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:050209energyscandals.txt:1:880816704cc1", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 7232, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "050209energyscandals.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "050209energyscandals", "chunk_index": 2, "text": "heard saying on the tape.** And when states complained, the guys at Enron seemed to have a response. \"Get a f****** clue,\" one says. \"Yeah,\" another chimes in. \"Leave us alone.

But former CEO Ken Lay - in this Enron training tape obtained by CBS News - had a different message. **\"Enron in a company that deals with everyone with absolute integrity. We play by all of the rules,\" Lay said in a pre-recorded video.** A federal Grand Jury didn't buy it. Lay has been indicted, and the tapes could be used as evidence against him. As can other video and audiotapes. An Enron spokesperson would only say the company continues to cooperate with all ongoing investigations.

Yet secrecy for reasons of \"national security\" can often be misused to cover-up major problems and scandals within government. Those involved in the deception simply claim that national security would be threatened if the information were to be released. This is especially true when money is involved. When hundreds of millions of dollars cannot be accounted for, the public needs to know where our tax dollars have gone. Too much of the hundreds of billions of tax dollars that flow into the military-industrial complex routinely disappears down black holes. **A [CBS article](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/the-war-on-waste/) quotes Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld stating, \"According to some estimates we cannot track $2.3 trillion in transactions.\"** Let us all join together in calling for greater transparency in government. Yet let us not forget, as well, to work towards greater openness and transparency in our own lives. Where are each of us not in integrity around money in our lives? Take care and have a great day!

The top CIA weapons hunter is home, and analysts are back at Langley. In interviews, officials who served with the Iraq Survey Group (ISG) said the violence in Iraq, coupled with a lack of new information, led them to fold up the effort shortly before Christmas. **Four months after Charles A. Duelfer, who led the weapons hunt in 2004, submitted an interim report to Congress that contradicted nearly every prewar assertion about Iraq made by top Bush administration officials, a senior intelligence official said the findings will stand as the ISG's final conclusions and will be published this spring.** President Bush, Vice President Cheney and other top administration officials asserted before the U.S. invasion in March 2003 that Iraq was reconstituting its nuclear weapons program, had chemical and biological weapons, and maintained links to al Qaeda affiliates to whom it might give such weapons to use against the United States.

Bush has expressed disappointment that no weapons or weapons programs were found, but the White House has been reluctant to call off the hunt, holding out the possibility that weapons were moved out of Iraq before the war or are well hidden somewhere inside the country. But the intelligence official said that possibility is very small. Duelfer is back in Washington, finishing some addenda to his September report before it is reprinted. \"There's no particular news in them, just some odds and ends,\" the intelligence official said. The Government Printing Office will publish it in book form, the official said. **The CIA declined to authorize any official involved in the weapons search to speak on the record for this story. The intelligence official offered an authoritative account of the status of the hunt on the condition of anonymity**. The agency did confirm that Duelfer is wrapping up his work and will not be replaced in Baghdad. The ISG, established to search for weapons but now enmeshed in counterinsurgency work, remains under Pentagon command and is being led by Marine Corps Brig. Gen. Joseph McMenamin. Intelligence officials said there is little left for the ISG to investigate because Duelfer's last report answered as many outstanding questions as possible. The ISG has interviewed every person it could find connected to programs that ended more than 10 years ago, and every suspected site within Iraq has been fully searched, or stripped bare by insurgents and thieves, according to several people involved in the weapons hunt. Satellite photos show that entire facilities have been dismantled, possibly by scrap dealers who sold off parts and equipment to buyers around the world. \"The September 30 report is really pretty much the picture,\" the intelligence official said. \"We've talked to so many people that someone would have said something. We received nothing that contradicts the picture we've put forward. It's possible there is a supply someplace, but what is much more likely is that [as time goes by] we will find a greater substantiation of the picture that we've already put forward.\" **Congress allotted hundreds of millions of dollars for the weapons hunt, and there has been no public accounting of the money.

But their work is focused on material that could support possible war crimes charges or shed light on the fate of Capt. Michael Scott Speicher, a Navy pilot who was shot down in an F/A-18 fighter over central Iraq on Jan. 17, 1991, the opening night of the Persian Gulf War. Although he was initially reported as killed in action, Speicher's status was changed to missing after evidence emerged that he had ejected alive from his aircraft. The work on documents is not connected to weapons of mass destruction, officials said, and a small group of Iraqi scientists still in U.S. military custody are not being held in connection with weapons investigations, either. Three people involved with the ISG said the weapons teams made several pleas to the Pentagon to release the scientists, who have been interviewed extensively. All three officials specifically mentioned Gen. Amir Saadi, who was a liaison between Hussein's government and U.N. inspectors; Rihab Taha, a biologist nicknamed \"Dr. Germ\" years ago by U.N. inspectors; her husband, Amir Rashid, the former oil minister; and Huda Amash, a biologist whose extensive dealings with U.N. inspectors earned her the nickname \"Mrs. Anthrax.\" None of the scientists has been involved in weapons programs since the 1991 Gulf War, the ISG determined more than a year ago, and all have cooperated with investigators despite nearly two years of jail time without charges. U.S. officials previously said they were being held because their denials of ongoing weapons programs were presumed to be lies; now, they say the scientists are being held in connection with the possible war crimes trials of Iraqis. It has been more than a year since any Iraqi scientist was arrested in connection with weapons of mass destruction. Many of those questioned and cleared have since left Iraq, one senior official said, acknowledging for the first time that the \"brain drain\" that has long been feared \"is well underway.\" \"A lot of it is because of the kidnapping industry\" in Iraq, the official said. The State Department has been trying to implement programs designed to keep Iraqi scientists from seeking weapons-related work in neighboring countries, such as Syria and Iran. Since March 2003, nearly a dozen people working for or with the weapons hunt have lost their lives to the insurgency.

Tom Feeney might have rigged the election in South Florida ** BY TREVOR AARONSON trevor.aaronson@newtimesbpb.com In the fall of 2000, Republican power broker Tom Feeney attended a meeting at Yang Enterprises in Oviedo, near Orlando, a former employee of the firm says. Feeney, who would soon become Florida's speaker of the House, wasn't just a politician; he was also a lobbyist. Among his clients was Yang, a small software company owned by a wealthy Chinese-American woman named Li-Woan Yang. Feeney went to his client with an assignment. According to a former company programmer, Feeney was interested in finding out whether electronic voting machines could be rigged. **\"Mr. Feeney said that he wanted to know if Yang Enterprises could develop a prototype of a voting program that could alter the vote tabulation in an election and be undetectable,\" programmer Clint Curtis would later write in a sworn affidavit submitted to U.S. Congress.** The meeting took place about a month before the 2000 election debacle and a year before electronic voting machines were introduced in the Sunshine State. For that reason, **the 46-year-old Curtis, a lifelong Republican, didn't think he would be helping to fix an election.** Feeney was acting preemptively, Curtis surmised. He simply wanted to know if an election could be rigged. **Curtis created a simple software program intended for electronic voting machines.

He simply wanted to know if an election could be rigged. **Curtis created a simple software program intended for electronic voting machines. The program could manipulate true results and ensure that a losing candidate would win 51 percent to 49 percent. ** **Li-Woan Yang then allegedly confided to Curtis something astonishing. \"This program is needed to control the vote in South Florida,\" she said. ** It was a revelation that, Curtis says, seemed to have little significance at the time. Electronic voting machines were not in use in the state, and the voting scandals of 2000 were more about disenfranchisement than technology. Eventually, though, the importance of Yang's statement became clear, he told New Times. \"Feeney was just looking ahead,\" he says now. \"The Republicans play to win.\" **On December 6, 2004, Curtis submitted to Democratic members of the House Judiciary Committee a four-page affidavit detailing the meeting with Feeney. The voting machines used in Broward, Palm Beach, and other Florida counties, Curtis pointed out, run proprietary software that cannot be examined by the public, making the use of a vote-stealing program feasible. Feeney and Yang Enterprises planned to manipulate the vote in Democrat-heavy South Florida, he told the congressmen. That testimony was never reported by major Florida news organizations.** Feeney and Yang quickly dismissed Curtis' claims. \"Our view is that Curtis is just a disgruntled former employee who has an ax to grind,\" says Yang attorney Michael A. O'Quinn, Feeney's former law partner. \"The guy's a crackpot, a funny nuisance.\" Curtis' past involvement with Feeney, however, lends some legitimacy to the vote-rigging charge. In 2002, after leaving Yang Enterprises, Curtis told state officials that Feeney greased political wheels for Yang Enterprises to be awarded an $8 million Florida Department of Transportation (FDOT) technology contract, for which Yang then allegedly overbilled the state. Despite a state Commission on Ethics investigation that cleared Feeney of wrongdoing, a Daytona Beach newspaper subsequently found e-mails showing that Feeney had indeed arranged a meeting between Yang and state officials. Chalk that one up to Curtis. The first time Curtis blew the whistle on Feeney, he was vindicated. He has since released a self-published book about the alleged shenanigans at Yang Enterprises, Just a Fly on the Wall. Feeney, who has served one term in Congress, representing a district east of Orlando, has a reputation as a devout neoconservative with a flare for using hot-button issues to his advantage. Former Gov. Lawton Chiles once described him as \"the David Duke of Florida politics.\" Yet the Central Florida politician has steadily climbed the ranks of GOP power.

Former Gov. Lawton Chiles once described him as \"the David Duke of Florida politics.\" Yet the Central Florida politician has steadily climbed the ranks of GOP power. He was Jeb Bush's running mate in 1994 during the governor's first, unsuccessful candidacy. He became state House speaker in 2000 after a track record that included sponsoring the \"Choose Life\" license plate and threatening to have Florida secede from the union if the national deficit topped $6 trillion. In 2002, Feeney won his congressional seat despite being outspent by his opponent, Democrat Harry Jacobs, 2-to-1. The political intrigue in Curtis' charges against Feeney is the stuff of pulp novels. **In February 2001, Curtis had left Yang Enterprises and received a contract to work for FDOT in Tallahassee. That's when he discovered that Yang had been overbilling the state of Florida, he says. Among the sham invoices were hours billed for Curtis during weeks he no longer worked for Yang, Curtis alleges. He took the information to Mavis Georgalis, FDOT's manager of specialized technologies, who was charged with overseeing the Yang contract. She had suspected fraudulent invoices as well. In July 2001, the pair filed a complaint with the FDOT inspector general. The investigation seemed to go nowhere. ** On March 29, 2002, a frustrated Curtis sent an e-mail to FDOT Chief Information Officer Nelson Hill. \"Invoices depicting the overbilling claims... [were] clearly on the documents presented to the IG's Office,\" Curtis wrote. \"I can only assume that, since Tom Feeney is Yang's official lobbyist, nothing was done.\" **On April 1, 2002, Curtis and Georgalis were fired, ostensibly for violating FDOT policies in monitoring the Yang project. (A judge later reinstated Georgalis pending the outcome of her whistle-blower lawsuit.) But even after their dismissal, Ray Lemme, an official with the FDOT Inspector General's Office, continued to investigate the allegations. In June 2003, according to Curtis' affidavit, Lemme met with him. He reportedly told Curtis that he had traced the case \"all the way to the top.\" ** **A month later, on July 3, 2002, police in Valdosta, Georgia, found Lemme dead in a bathtub at Knight's Inn, a cheap motel near Interstate 75, just across the Florida border. His left arm was slashed with a razor blade in an apparent suicide. \"I love my family with all my heart,\" an unsigned suicide note read. \"I am sorry.\" In a missing-persons report, Lemme's wife, Mary Ann, told the Leon County Sheriff's Office that her husband had \"been under a lot of stress at work due to a 'big' case.\"** FDOT is expected to", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:050217riggedelections.txt:2:bbfbcd8bfa55", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 7241, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "050217riggedelections.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "050217riggedelections", "chunk_index": 3, "text": "a bathtub at Knight's Inn, a cheap motel near Interstate 75, just across the Florida border.

On September 30, 2002, the state Commission on Ethics cleared Feeney of any conflict of interest in his role of steering state contracts to Yang. Feeney had told the ethics commission that he hadn't addressed \"anyone at FDOT... concerning the Yangs.\" That was apparently untrue, according to an October 12, 2002, report by the Daytona Beach News-Journal. E-mails uncovered by the newspaper showed that Feeney in fact had arranged a July 2000 meeting between Yang and Roy Cales, the FDOT official with the power to award computer contracts. At the time, Feeney was one of the most powerful members of the state House. The e-mails finally confirmed Curtis' claim that Feeney used his public influence to benefit Yang. Anyone with a passing interest in Feeney would have found evidence of the former House speaker's cozy relationship with Yang. For 15 years, Feeney had been the company lobbyist and lawyer. He ended the professional relationship, which had extended through all 12 years of his time in the state House, only after he was elected to the U.S. Congress in 2002. Since October 1999, the Yang family has donated $13,700 to Feeney's campaigns. His 2002 congressional campaign even rented office space from Yang. With Feeney's firm hand missing, Yang strayed into hot water last year. On March 12, 2004, federal agents in Orlando arrested two Chinese men, including Hai Lin \"Henry\" Nee, after they tried to ship U.S. missile technology to China. In his affidavit, Curtis alleges that Yang employed Nee on projects with access to state and NASA data. Since Curtis submitted his affidavit two months ago, Yang has been on damage control. In an official statement posted on its website to counter Curtis' claims, Yang Enterprises says it never had an employee named Nee. However, state records obtained by New Times show that the company submitted nine weekly time cards for a Henry Nee in 1998. The question remains, though: Did Feeney ever ask his good buddies at Yang Enterprises if they could rig electronic-voting machines in South Florida? \"We're not going to dignify Clint Curtis' ridiculous allegations with a comment,\" says Shannon Conklin, Feeney's press secretary. Asked about Curtis' other charges involving Feeney, Yang, and FDOT, Conklin noted that the state ethics commission \"addressed the matter and cleared Congressman Feeney.\" She claimed to have no knowledge of e-mails showing", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:050217riggedelections.txt:3:b4b2f0f7fa1f", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 7242, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "050217riggedelections.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "050217riggedelections", "chunk_index": 4, "text": "for a Henry Nee in 1998.

Meanwhile, the allegations of vote-rigging have stirred up outrage on the Internet. Bloggers have reported on the story with idealistic conviction. But no one has yet been able to say definitively whether Curtis, who has no criminal record, is telling the truth this time. Why did he wait four years to come forward? Curtis claims he was working with Lemme long before submitting the affidavit to Congress. In the past, Curtis' assertions have been true, contends Tallahassee lawyer Martin Fitzpatrick, who represents Georgalis in her whistle-blower case. \"I have been working with Clint Curtis over the past three years on issues relating to my representation of Ms. Georgalis,\" Fitzpatrick says. \"In my dealings with Clint with regard to these two cases, I am unaware of any incident in which he lied.\" **See our archive of revealing news articles at [https://www.WantToKnow.info/medianewsarticles](https://www.WantToKnow.info/medianewsarticles)** Your tax-deductible donations, however large or small, help greatly to support this important work.

Though a lifelong conservative, Kwiatkowski found herself appalled as the radical wing of the Bush administration, including her superiors in the Pentagon planning department, bulldozed internal dissent, overlooked its own intelligence and relentlessly pushed for confrontation with Iraq. She left the military in March 2003, the same week that troops invaded Iraq. Afterwards, Kwiatkowski started putting her real name on her Web reports and began accepting speaking invitations. \"I'm now a soldier for the truth,\" she said in a speech at Cal Poly Pomona. **Below, you will find a link for free viewing of the excellent 70-minute documentary, *Hijacking Catastrophe,* which reveals the dark plans of the Neo-Con agenda.** Kwiatkowski is only one among several respected individuals who reveal what is happening behind the scenes in this powerful film.

Col. USAF retired) Better than anyone to date, the Media Education Foundation has quietly and accurately documented the most important history of 21st century thus far in their recent video and DVD release, *Hijacking Catastrophe: 9/11, Fear, and the Selling of American Empire*. ***Hijacking Catastrophe***** is powerful, understated, straightforward and educational. In a single meticulously organized hour of evidence and analysis, viewers are treated to a thoughtful explanation of modern American empire, neo-conservatism as a driving force for the current Bush administration, and something I have not seen before, a real economic analysis of what is driving some of our current \"global war on terror.\"** The film examines the Bush Administration's investment in neo-conservatism, and the early, and already horrific, results. While past performance is no guarantee of future earnings, *Hijacking Catastrophe* shows exactly why America's \"new conservatism\" is a pyramid scheme of inhumane proportions. The film examines eight aspects of the current situation of American foreign policy. The film provides an explanation for the obvious continuity between Cold War policies and those of the present. It examines long-term neoconservative thinking and how this peculiar version of Jacobin utopianism ascended from its rather inauspicious political roots. **The film explores the dangerous territory of how the post 9-11", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:050223kwiatkowskihijackingcatastrophe.txt:0:544de2f314fe", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 7244, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "050223kwiatkowskihijackingcatastrophe.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "050223kwiatkowskihijackingcatastrophe", "chunk_index": 1, "text": "of future earnings, *Hijacking Catastrophe* shows exactly why America's \"new conservatism\" is a pyramid scheme of inhumane proportions.

It describes the neoconservative vision of military dominance over a supine, energy-rich Middle East, not only for its own sake, but as a warning to other potential international rivals. *Hijacking Catastrophe* describes the cost of empire in a way so comprehensive that it becomes clear that neo-conservatism, as a foreign policy guide, comes with a very real moral, political and financial garnishment of every American, and of American children yet unborn. **The cost is shown not only as a current financial outlay or in lives unlived on the part of soldiers and marines, but in terms of an alarming debt burden, loss of domestic freedom, the growing and invasive state, a permanent tattering of the Constitution and Bill of Rights.** **See our archive of revealing news articles at [https://www.WantToKnow.info/medianewsarticles](https://www.WantToKnow.info/medianewsarticles)** Your tax-deductible donations, however large or small, help greatly to support this important work.

Bush in the president's dealings with the leader of Indonesia, the world's most populous Muslim nation. Now Mr. Burks has popped up in Jakarta as a star witness for the defense in the terrorism trial of a fundamentalist Islamic cleric. \"He has some anger but he's a nice old man,\" says Mr. Burks of Abu Bakar Baasyir, the 68-year-old preacher the U.S. believes was behind the 2002 Bali bombings. The cleric is also believed by the U.S. to be the leader of a regional terrorist network linked to al Qaeda, but he strongly denies that and, in an earlier trial in 2003, an Indonesian court cleared him of directing a terrorist outfit. **Mr. Burks's testimony, delivered last month in a south Jakarta court, turned the former White House interpreter and sometime psychiatric nurse into a national celebrity here in Indonesia.** He appeared on TV, spoke at universities, and was featured in magazines and newspapers. His rock-star aura had strangers stopping him on the street when he traveled here to testify from his home in Berkeley, Calif. But he's considerably less popular these days with his former employers in the White House and the State Department, who praise his linguistic talents but are mighty upset that he has been spilling details of supposedly confidential conversations. \"He's gone off some deep end,\" says Stephanie Van Reigersberg, his former boss. During the years that Mr. Burks was paid to whisper into the president's ear, she headed a State Department unit that provides interpreters for State, the White House and other branches of the U.S. government. **Speaking to the Jakarta court in fluent Indonesian, Mr. Burks described a secret 2002 meeting between a U.S. presidential envoy and Indonesia's then president, Megawati Sukarnoputri. He said the American had demanded that Ms. Megawati secretly detain Mr. Baasyir and then hand him over to the U.S. This demand preceded the Bali bombings and, says Mr. Burks, shows that the U.S. had it in for Mr. Baasyir even before his alleged crimes and suggests a frame-up.** Karen Brooks, who served as Mr. Bush's", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:050226fredburkswsj.txt:1:ca98712dd23f", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 7247, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "050226fredburkswsj.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "050226fredburkswsj", "chunk_index": 2, "text": "Jakarta court in fluent Indonesian, Mr. Burks described a secret 2002 meeting between a U.S. presidential envoy and Indonesia's then president, Megawati Sukarnoputri.

But she and the U.S. embassy in Jakarta deny his claims that the U.S. pressured Indonesia to hand over Mr. Baasyir. (They won't say what the meeting was about.) Ms. Megawati hasn't commented publicly but did attend a party in Jakarta to fete Mr. Burks during his recent visit. Worried that Mr. Burks's testimony might upend Indonesia's most high-profile terrorism case, the prosecution has sought to undermine the American's credibility as a witness and grilled him in court about drug use and oddball writings [rhapsodizing about a dead dolphin](https://www.WantToKnow.info/presidentialsurprises). (A previous attempt to prosecute the cleric fizzled: the only charge that stuck involved immigration violations.) Mr. Burks, who grew up in New Jersey and California, says he has experimented on occasion with ecstasy and peyote as part of his \"spiritual journey.\" \"I was in disbelief that this guy was an interpreter for the president of the United States,\" said prosecutor Salman Maryadi after the hearing. \"Considering his condition, how could he interpret for the leader of the world's sole superpower?\" The judge ruled the prosecutor's questioning about Mr. Burks's private peccadilloes irrelevant. The U.S. government seems to have taken much the same view. For over 15 years, it used Mr. Burks's linguistic dexterity -- he also speaks excellent Chinese -- despite his refusal to sign a confidentiality agreement. Never a full-time government employee, he regularly worked on contract for the State Department, securing interpreting gigs with President Clinton, Mr. Bush and a number of lesser officials. He learned his Indonesian while living with a family on the island of Borneo in the 1980s, picked up Chinese during a teaching stint in China and, after training as a nurse in Florida, mixed interpreting and nursing. **Ms. Brooks, the former White House Indonesia expert, remembers Mr. Burks as the \"most talented interpreter I've ever seen\" but says she's flabbergasted that he never signed a confidentiality pledge.** \"You'd think we'd be vetting these people,\" she says.

Confronted with a dearth of qualified speakers of foreign languages -- frequently noted as a serious problem by officials and others since 9/11 -- the U.S. government has scrounged for talent, with few questions asked. Mr. Burks, a former high-school math star whose friends called him \"Freddy Whiz-o,\" says he never hid his views or enthusiasms. He says he had a mandatory, low-level security clearance, mainly a testament that he didn't have a police record, but declined to sign a confidentiality pledge. He says he also balked at filling in lengthy forms required to get secret clearance because he'd have had to confess to having twice taken ecstasy. \"I couldn't lie,\" says Mr. Burks. Ms. Van Reigersberg, who headed the State Department's interpreting division until last year, when she retired, says that while Mr. Burks wasn't bound by formal legal constraints, he was bound by professional ethics not to divulge what was said \"by either a president or a policeman.\" She says she feels \"mystified\" and \"indignant\" now that he has decided to blab. Ms. Van Reigersberg remembers Mr. Burks as \"very nice and very intelligent,\" and so good at his work that the State Department paid him to help train other interpreters. She says he was always an \"interesting character\" but says she never knew much about his quirky Web musings. **While working as Mr. Bush's Indonesian-language interpreter, Mr. Burks set up several Web sites, including [momentoflove.org](https://www.momentoflove.org), [weboflove.org](https://www.weboflove.org) and [WantToKnow.info](https://www.WantToKnow.info). After 9/11, he began collecting and then [posting documents](https://www.WantToKnow.info/911/9-11-facts) he believes show that parts of the U.S. government knew an attack was coming and may even have been complicit in its execution. \"I'm sometimes labeled a conspiracy theorist, but I'm not,\" he says. \"I'm someone who can handle dark energy, the really ugly things that are going on behind the scenes, without getting too upset.\"** When he made an [illegal holiday trip to Cuba](https://www.WantToKnow.info/cubatravelban) in 1999 and got hit with a $7,900 fine, he says he told the State Department he hadn't realized that Americans were barred from going to Cuba. He kept his job, and found a lawyer to fight the fine. He's still waiting for a court hearing where he can contest the penalty. He even survived a controversial foray into last year's presidential election: He [posted allegations](https://www.WantToKnow.info/bushearphone) on his Web site that Mr. Bush used a secret listening device in meetings he had attended with President Megawati and most likely had done the same in debate with Sen.

The son of a Methodist preacher, Mr. Burks says he initially rebelled against his upbringing by resisting his father's antiestablishment take on life. He now describes himself as a \"spiritual activist\" but says he's still \"more a Republican than a Democrat\" on economic questions. In early 2001, he says, a friend turned him on to [a film](https://www.WantToKnow.info/060602ufosvideosfootage) purporting to expose a plot by the government to conceal the existence of [Unidentified Flying Objects](https://www.WantToKnow.info/ufoinformation). \"The information blew me away,\" he says. But, he adds: \"I hesitate telling people quickly about this because they'll say I'm a nut.\" **When President Bush traveled to Bali for a meeting with President Megawati in October 2003, the State Department had another interpreter lined up, but the White House insisted on having Mr. Burks. Ms. Brooks, then the National Security Council's Indonesia expert, says she personally requested that he get the job because he was so good and \"Megawati loved him.\"** On the morning the two presidents met, Mr. Burks took an early morning jog on the beach and came across a dead dolphin, an encounter [he later described](https://www.WantToKnow.info/presidentialsurprises) in an e-mail he sent to friends and colleagues. He says he knelt down and \"opened to the spirit of this dead dolphin\" and \"felt its presence with me...and the joyful presence of the entire school of living dolphins.\" Their \"loving presence,\" he says, penetrated the traveling White House in Bali and made senior U.S. officials act in a strangely friendly way. The White House declined to comment on that. The defense team for Mr. Baasyir, the accused terrorist, came across Mr. Burks's name in an article in an Indonesian newspaper that mentioned his allegations of secret U.S. pressure to hand over the cleric. Ahmad Wirawan Adnan, a defense lawyer, decided to send a message asking him to testify but considered it a long shot. \"I thought we would have to sweet-talk him and persuade him.

They weren't and gave Mr. Burks's visit and his views blanket coverage. \"I had trouble making a schedule for him he was so busy,\" says Mr. Adnan, the lawyer. **Mr. Burks says he enjoyed the [celebrity treatment](https://www.WantToKnow.info/050129fredburkscelebrity) but is now glad to be home so he can get back to work exposing coverups. \"I was put here on this planet for a purpose,\" he says.** After his return to California, he dropped in a mailbox a letter he had been given by Mr. Baasyir, the alleged terrorist ringleader, for delivery to President Bush. It reads: \"You will be punished with horrific torture in the afterlife, but you don't have to lose heart because there is still an opportunity for you to save yourself from Allah's really horrific torture.\" It then encourages Mr. Bush to convert to Islam. Contacted by telephone in jail in Jakarta, Mr. Baasyir expressed gratitude to and admiration for Mr. Burks, describing the former White House interpreter as a man whose \"main goal is to uncover all of George Bush's lies.\" Mr. Burks's willingness to testify, said the cleric, is a \"peculiar\" form of \"bravery.\" Mr. Burks says he's flattered by all the attention but will be upset if it turns out Mr. Baasyir really is a terrorist: \"I would feel bad.

Yet these same officials and others, though acknowledging my presence at the meeting, have continually denied in the international press putting pressure on Indonesia in this case. I've made a few editing adjustments to the original, like removing the name of the CIA agent. The end of the writing has some humorous details I think you'll enjoy. May each of us have the courage to stand and speak the truth when it clearly is in the interests of all good people who share our world. Take care and have a great day.

I got a call from Karen Brooks, the Indonesian expert on the National Security Council one Friday in September. The very next day I hopped on a plane to meet her and another woman for a secret presidential briefing in Jakarta. This other woman ended up letting me know she was a CIA agent. It's the first time anyone has ever admitted being in the CIA to me. She and I dined together one night. She said she enjoys and believes in the work, even though it means she often has to live a secret life. As an example, she couldn't go out with a friend in Jakarta on this visit, as no one was supposed to know that she was there. She was headed out on a secret mission to Afghanistan immediately after Jakarta. **Secret Clearance. **During the initial phone call from Karen, she asked me if I had secret clearance. I told her that I have only a basic, low-level clearance. She said, \"Oh sh*t! Well, can you keep a secret?\" I'd been invited to apply for secret clearance a couple times in past years, but was told it was not required.

As long as I don't have to, I'd rather not go through the process as it's a big hassle. Over a year ago, Stephanie, the chief of Interpreting at the State Department, told me that it could make things easier in the future if I had secret clearance. I informed her that I had used the drug ecstasy twice about four years prior and could not lie about this on the forms. After hearing this, she recommended that I don't apply for secret clearance. She appreciated my honesty, though. We've become friends, and I've even given her information on the major cover-ups from [www.WantToKnow.info](https://www.WantToKnow.info). I'd rather be honest about my own life and risk being fired than try to keep something secret. I would not make a good CIA agent. **A Wanted Man. **At the meeting with Megawati, Ambassador Ralph Boyce, Karen Brooks, myself, and the CIA agent were present. The CIA agent was introduced as a special assistant to the president. She told Megawati that the US needed help in \"rendering\" Muslim cleric Abu Bakar Ba'asyir, who she claimed had known ties to Al Qaeda. I had just learned that rendering means a secret agreement between two governments to covertly capture and turn over a wanted person. The \"special assistant\" said that US intelligence had proof that Ba'asyir had made two attempts on Megawati's life, in addition to masterminding a number of other heinous plots as the leader of Jemaah Islamiah. This information came from Omar al-Faruq, who had been rendered to the US previously by Indonesia. Megawati responded that unlike al-Faruq, Ba'asyir was quite well known in Indonesia and revered by many (he is something like a Muslim version of Jerry Falwell or Pat Robertson). To secretly hand him over to the US would likely cause political and religious instability that she could not afford. The special assistant responded that she understood these legitimate concerns, but that if Ba'asyir wasn't turned over by the time of the APEC meeting (about six weeks later), the situation could become difficult. Megawati responded that the only way she could turn him over was if public opinion of Ba'asyir were somehow to turn against him. She also said that she hoped this situation would not lead to a severing of the good relations between our countries. It's very interesting to note that just a few weeks after this meeting, a nightclub in Bali was bombed, killing nearly 100 Australians and", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:050228secretmeeting.txt:1:6cb01385c9e3", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 7254, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "050228secretmeeting.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "050228secretmeeting", "chunk_index": 2, "text": "the APEC meeting (about six weeks later), the situation could become difficult.

It's very interesting to note that just a few weeks after this meeting, a nightclub in Bali was bombed, killing nearly 100 Australians and another 100 Indonesians. US intelligence almost immediately linked Ba'asyir to the bombing. This gave Megawati the reason she needed, and the cleric is now in Indonesian custody, though he has not been rendered to the US. As the majority of Bali bombing victims were Australian, the bombing also served to scare both the Australian government and people into much more fully supporting the American war on terror. They had previously been quite reluctant. So the bombing ended up being very convenient for the American government-a little too convenient in my opinion. **Layers of Secrecy. **On this particular visit, I spent a lot of time in secure parts of the embassy (which was under bomb threat alert at the time with concrete barricades out front and all). There were numerous notices on the walls stating, \"Taking classified documents home is a violation of federal law.\" I worked on translating classified documents on a classified computer. It was quite something to see layer upon layer of security and secrecy in the embassy. It's very sad to me that this is how governments are run. I am very much into total transparency in my life. I find it incredibly liberating to live without hiding anything. Even the \"secret\" meetings I've interpreted for often end up being leaked (not by me) so that I can talk about them. **High-level Anti-terrorism Training. **A few weeks after the Megawati briefing, I interpreted at an anti-terrorism training for high-ranking Indonesian police in Washington, DC. This took place at the same time all of the sniper killings were going on there. In this one-week course we had some very interesting high-level speakers. A three-star general who specialized in intelligence started off his speech with \"Everything I tell you is the truth.\" Just a few sentences later, he stated, \"We have no CIA officers in Indonesia.\" He was so full of it!!! I could hardly believe it! He even looked like he was lying! Several of the Indonesian police generals told me they didn't believe the guy. On the other hand, a four-star U.S. army general gave a great talk on the importance of effective communication and taught some empowering methods for this. I learned later that this friendly general had retired from the army during the Gulf War because there was too much bullsh*t going on behind the scenes.

Fascinating experiences!!! ** A Funny Story :o) **I have to share one funny, fascinating story. The day after I arrived in Jakarta for the Megawati briefing, the US Embassy called me in to do some written translation. When I asked about clothing, they said to come dressed casually as the Megawati briefing wouldn't happen till the following day. I breathed a sigh of relief, because for the first time in my life, I had forgotten to bring my dress shirts when I packed back home! On discovering my huge error after getting into my hotel the previous evening, I ran out and managed to buy a couple decent shirts that fit, but I hadn't had a chance to iron them yet! After several hours working in my casual clothes in the embassy, one of the guys came rushing up saying, \"The briefing time has been changed. We're going to do it NOW!\" I responded, \"That may be a problem because I don't have a suit with me.\" I was thinking to myself that even if I rushed back to the hotel by taxi, my new shirts were not ironed and would look terrible! Taking a deep breath, I offered to rush to the hotel to change, feeling it was my only option at this point. The guy stopped for a moment and looked at me kind of strange-like he was sizing me up or something. \"What size neck do you have?\" he asked. And then \"What size chest and waist?\" Ten minutes later I was wearing this guy's suit, which he always kept hanging in his office for unexpected meetings! It just happens that we were exactly the same size-height and all!!! I looked great at the briefing as his suit fit perfectly!!!

In his 10-year tenure, **Mayor Mockus focused on changing hearts and minds - not through preaching but through artistically creative strategies that employed the power of individual**. He also spoke openly of his own failings, not suggesting that he was more moral than anyone else. May we all focus on creatively changing hearts and minds for the good of all with whom we share this world. **Academic turns city into a social experiment Mayor Mockus of Bogota and his spectacularly applied theory By María Cristina Caballero Special to the Harvard News Office ** Mimes instead of traffic police Antanas Mockus had just resigned from the top job of Colombian National University. A mathematician and philosopher, Mockus looked around for another big challenge and found it: to be in charge of, as he describes it, \"a 6.5 million person classroom.\" **Mockus, who had no political experience, ran for mayor of Bogota. He was successful mainly because people in Colombia's capital city saw him as an honest guy.** With an educator's inventiveness, Mockus turned Bogota into a social experiment just as the city was choked with violence, lawless traffic, corruption, and gangs of street children who mugged and stole. It was a city perceived by some to be on the verge of chaos. People were desperate for a change, for a moral leader of some sort. The eccentric Mockus, who communicates through symbols, humor, and metaphors, filled the role. **When many hated the disordered and disorderly city of Bogota, he wore a Superman costume and acted as a superhero called \"Supercitizen.\" **People laughed at Mockus' antics, but the laughter began to break the ice of their extreme skepticism. Mockus recently came to Harvard for two weeks as a visiting fellow at the Kennedy School's Institute of Politics to share lessons about civic engagement with students and faculty. \"We found Mayor Mockus' presentation intensely interesting,\" said Adams Professor Jane Mansbidge of the Kennedy School, who invited Mockus to speak in her \"Democracy From Theory to Practice\" class. \"Our reading had focused on the standard material incentive-based systems for reducing corruption. He focused on changing hearts and minds - not through preaching but through artistically creative strategies that employed the power of individual and community disapproval. \"He also spoke openly of his own failings, not suggesting that he was more moral than anyone else.

The students were enchanted, as was I.\" **A theatrical teacher** The slim, bearded, 51-year-old former mayor explained himself thus: \"What really moves me to do things that other people consider original is my passion to teach.\" He has long been known for theatrical displays to gain people's attention and, then, to make them think. Mockus, the only son of a Lithuanian artist, burst onto the Colombian political scene in 1993 when, faced with a rowdy auditorium of the school of arts' students, he dropped his pants and mooned them to gain quiet. The gesture, he said at the time, should be understood \"as a part of the resources which an artist can use.\" He resigned as rector, the top job of Colombian National University, and soon decided to run for mayor. **The fact that he was seen as an unusual leader gave the new mayor the opportunity to try extraordinary things, such as hiring 420 mimes to control traffic in Bogota's chaotic and dangerous streets. He launched a \"Night for Women\" and asked the city's men to stay home in the evening and care for the children;** 700,000 women went out on the first of three nights that Mockus dedicated to them. When there was a water shortage, Mockus appeared on TV programs taking a shower and turning off the water as he soaped, asking his fellow citizens to do the same. In just two months people were using 14 percent less water, a savings that increased when people realized how much money they were also saving because of economic incentives approved by Mockus; water use is now 40 percent less than before the shortage. \"The distribution of knowledge is the key contemporary task,\" Mockus said. \"Knowledge empowers people. If people know the rules, and are sensitized by art, humor, and creativity, they are much more likely to accept change.\" Mockus taught vivid lessons with these tools. One time, he asked citizens to put their power to use with 350,000 \"thumbs-up\" and \"thumbs-down\" cards that his office distributed to the populace. The cards were meant to approve or disapprove of other citizens' behavior; it was a device that many people actively - and peacefully - used in the streets. **He also asked people to pay 10 percent extra in voluntary taxes. To the surprise of many, 63,000 people voluntarily paid the extra taxes. **A dramatic indicator of the shift in the attitude of \"Bogotanos\" during Mockus' tenure is that, in 2002, the city collected more than three times the revenues it had garnered in 1990. Another Mockus inspiration was to ask people to call his office if they found", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:050305mockustransformsbogota.txt:1:2d91ae6929c3", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 7258, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "050305mockustransformsbogota.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "050305mockustransformsbogota", "chunk_index": 2, "text": "people actively - and peacefully - used in the streets. **He also asked people to pay 10 percent extra in voluntary taxes.

Another Mockus inspiration was to ask people to call his office if they found a kind and honest taxi driver; 150 people called and the mayor organized a meeting with all those good taxi drivers, who advised him about how to improve the behavior of mean taxi drivers. Yet Mockus doesn't like to be called a leader. **\"There is a tendency to be dependent on individual leaders,\" he said. \"To me, it is important to develop collective leadership.** I don't like to get credit for all that we achieved. Millions of people contributed to the results that we achieved ... I like more egalitarian relationships. I especially like to orient people to learn.\" **Taking a moral stand** Still, there were times when Mockus felt he needed to impose his will, such as when he demanded that every bar and entertainment place close at 1 a.m. with the goal of diminishing drinking and violence. **Most important to Mockus was his campaign about the importance and sacredness of life. \"In a society where human life has lost value,\" he said, \"there cannot be a higher priority than re-establishing respect for life as the main right and duty of citizens.\" Mockus sees the reduction of homicides from 80 per 100,000 inhabitants in 1993 to 22 per 100,000 inhabitants in 2003 as a major achievement, noting also that traffic fatalities dropped by more than half in the same time period, from an average of 1,300 per year to about 600. ** Contributing to this success was the mayor's inspired decision to paint stars on the spots where pedestrians (1,500 of them) had been killed in traffic accidents. \"Saving a single life justifies the effort,\" Mockus said. The former mayor had to address many fronts simultaneously. In his struggle against corruption, he closed down the transit police because many of those 2,000 members were notoriously bribable. When he assumed power, many city positions were distributed according to council members' recommendations. \"I stopped that, and some called me an anti-patronage fundamentalist,\" Mockus said. He remembers that when he handed a text explaining his goals of transparency to one key council member, the council member first smiled, but later resigned. Mockus was a constant presence in the media, promoting his civic campaigns. \"My messages about the importance of protecting children from being burned with fireworks, protecting children from domestic violence, and the sacredness of life reached many, including the children,\" he said. **Once the mother of a 3-year-old girl called his", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:050305mockustransformsbogota.txt:2:a1ee801f8b58", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 7259, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "050305mockustransformsbogota.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "050305mockustransformsbogota", "chunk_index": 3, "text": "fundamentalist,\" Mockus said.

During the visit, the mother told him:** \"When I am going to hit her, she runs to the telephone and says that she is going to call Mockus. She doesn't even know how to dial a number, but obviously she thinks that you would protect her.\" **Mockus, who has two daughters himself, was shocked at the woman's nonchalance about striking her daughter. There is almost always a civics lesson behind Mockus' antics. Florence Thomas, a feminist and a professor at Colombian National University, pointed out to Mockus that in Bogota women were afraid to go out at night. \"We were looking for what would be the best image of a safe city, and I realized that if you see streets with many women you feel safer,\" Mockus explained. So he asked men to stay home and suggested that both sexes should take advantage of the \"Night for Women\" to reflect on women's role in society. About 700,000 women went out, flocking to free, open-air concerts. They flooded into bars that offered women-only drink specials and strolled down a central boulevard that had been converted into a pedestrian zone. To avoid legal challenges, the mayor stated that the men's curfew was strictly voluntary. Men who simply couldn't bear to stay indoors during the six-hour restriction were asked to carry self-styled \"safe conduct\" passes. About 200,000 men went out that night, some of them angrily calling Mockus a \"clown\" in TV interviews. But most men graciously embraced Mockus' campaign. In the lower-middle-class neighborhood of San Cristobal, women marched through the streets to celebrate their night. When they saw a man staying at home, carrying a baby, or taking care of children, the women stopped and applauded. That night the police commander was a woman, and 1,500 women police were in charge of Bogota's security. **A bigger classroom?** Mockus noted that his administrations were enlightened by academic concepts, including the work of Nobel Prize-winning economist Douglass North, who has investigated the tension between formal and informal rules and how economic development is restrained when those rules clash; and Jürgen Habermas' work on how dialogue creates social capital. **Mockus also mentions Socrates, who said that if people understood well, they probably would not act in the", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:050305mockustransformsbogota.txt:3:51d4dc2415ef", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 7260, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "050305mockustransformsbogota.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "050305mockustransformsbogota", "chunk_index": 4, "text": "and 1,500 women police were in charge of Bogota's security. **A bigger classroom?** Mockus noted that his administrations were enlightened by academic concepts, including the work of Nobel Prize-winning economist Douglass North, who has investigated the tension between formal and informal rules and how economic development is restrained when those rules clash; and Jürgen Habermas' work on how dialogue creates social capital. **Mockus also mentions Socrates, who said that if people understood well, they probably would not act in the wrong way. ** Mockus-a sterling example of the current vogue in Latin America for \"anti-politicians\"-says that transforming Bogota's people and their sense of civic culture was the key to solving many of the city's problems. He is looking forward to returning to the classroom at Colombian National University after a sabbatical year. But Mockus is also considering the possibility of launching a presidential campaign-and perhaps being in charge of a 42 million student classroom.

There is little doubt that this tsunami weapon was further developed and refined over the ensuing decades, though all documents related to current developments of the project are almost certainly still classified. **Though it may seem far-fetched to imagine military involvement, these documents and reports raise serious questions about the 2011 tsunami in Japan and the 2004 tsunami in Indonesia. ** The many layers of intense secrecy both in the government and military result in very few people being aware of the gruesome capabilities for death and destruction that have been developed over the years. Were it not for the below article in New Zealand's leading newspaper, the public would never have known that a tsunami bomb had been created many decades ago. No one denies that highly destructive weapons are being developed in secret by the militaries of the world. What the public doesn't know is what these weapons are, and what they are being used for. All of this is generally classified for reasons of \"national security.\" Sadly, the rubric of \"national security\" has all too often been used for secret political and economic gains which clearly do not benefit the public. Operation Northwoods, [uncovered by ABC News](https://www.WantToKnow.info/010501operationnorthwoods) in the year 2000, showed that the top Pentagon generals were willing to foment terrorism and sacrifice innocent civilians in order to provoke a war with Cuba in the early 1960s. Credible researchers into the government's [HAARP program](https://www.WantToKnow.info/war/haarp_weather_modification_electromagnetic_warfare_weapons) are convinced that this technology which manipulates our ionosphere is being used for military means and can even play a role in natural disasters like earthquakes.

Professor Thomas Leech's work was considered so significant that **United States defence chiefs said that if the project had been completed before the end of the war it could have played a role as effective as that of the atom bomb.** **Details of the tsunami bomb, known as Project Seal, are contained in 53-year-old [documents released](https://www.WantToKnow.info/documents/project_seal.pdf) by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade.** Papers stamped \"top secret\" show **the US and British military were eager for Seal to be developed in the post-war years too.** They even considered sending Professor Leech to Bikini Atoll to view the US nuclear tests and see if they had any application to his work. He did not make the visit, although a member of the US board of assessors of atomic tests, Dr Karl Compton, was sent to New Zealand. \"Dr Compton is impressed with Professor Leech's deductions on the Seal project and is prepared to recommend to the Joint Chiefs of Staff that all technical data from the test relevant to the Seal project should be", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:050307tsunamibombweapon.txt:1:d778097a20fb", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 7263, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "050307tsunamibombweapon.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "050307tsunamibombweapon", "chunk_index": 2, "text": "Atoll to view the US nuclear tests and see if they had any application to his work.

Professor Leech, who died in his native Australia in 1973, was the university's dean of engineering from 1940 to 1950. News of his being awarded a CBE [\"Commander of the Order of the British Empire\", a grade in the Order of the British Empire] in 1947 for research on a weapon led to speculation in newspapers around the world about what was being developed. Though high-ranking New Zealand and US officers spoke out in support of the research, no details of it were released because the work was on-going. A former colleague of Professor Leech, Neil Kirton, told the Weekend Herald that **the experiments involved laying a pattern of explosives underwater to create a tsunami.** Small-scale explosions were carried out in the Pacific and off Whangaparaoa, which at the time was controlled by the Army. It is unclear what happened to Project Seal once the final report was forwarded to Wellington Defence Headquarters late in the 1940s. The bomb was never tested on a full scale, and Mr Kirton doubts that Aucklanders would have noticed the trials. \"Whether it could ever be resurrected ... Under some circumstances I think it could be devastating.\" **What you can do:** Read other powerful, reliable major media articles on secret military weapons at [this link](https://www.WantToKnow.info/nonlethalweaponsnewsarticles).

Not on foreign terrorists, \"the adversary's closer to home.

Rumsfeld promised change but the next day - Sept. 11-- the world changed and in the rush to fund the war on terrorism, the war on waste seems to have been forgotten. Just last week President Bush announced, \"my 2003 budget calls for more than $48 billion in new defense spending.\" **More money for the Pentagon, CBS News Correspondent Vince Gonzales reports, while its own auditors admit the military cannot account for 25 percent of what it spends. ** **\"According to some estimates we cannot track $2.3 trillion in transactions,\" Rumsfeld admitted. ** **$2.3 trillion - that's $8,000 for every man, woman and child in America.** To understand how the Pentagon can lose track of trillions, consider the case of one military accountant who tried to find out what happened", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:050310pentagontrillionslost.txt:0:582a903da735", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 7266, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "050310pentagontrillionslost.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "050310pentagontrillionslost", "chunk_index": 1, "text": "spending.\" **More money for the Pentagon, CBS News Correspondent Vince Gonzales reports, while its own auditors admit the military cannot account for 25 percent of what it spends. ** **\"According to some estimates we cannot track $2.3 trillion in transactions,\" Rumsfeld admitted. ** **$2.3 trillion - that's $8,000 for every man, woman and child in America.** To understand how the Pentagon can lose track of trillions, consider the case of one military accountant who tried to find out what happened to a mere $300 million. \"We know it's gone.

It took me aback, you know? My supervisor asking me why I care about doing a good job,\" said Minnery. ** **He was reassigned and says officials then covered up the problem by just writing it off. ** \"They have to cover it up,\" he said. \"That's where the corruption comes in. They have to cover up the fact that they can't do the job.\" The Pentagon's Inspector General \"partially substantiated\" several of Minnery's allegations but could not prove officials tried \"to manipulate the financial statements.\" Twenty years ago, Department of Defense Analyst Franklin C. Spinney made headlines exposing what he calls the \"accounting games.\" He's still there, and although he does not speak for the Pentagon, he believes the problem has gotten worse. **\"Those numbers are pie in the sky.

Then, at the end of the email, I will introduce you to Challenge Day, the most transformative program I've ever seen for our young people. I can almost guarantee that a 15-minute video clip of this amazing non-profit organization will leave you moved and inspired. As you probably know, I manage four websites, all of which provide both heart-felt inspiration and empowering information to work together towards a brighter future. The [WantToKnow.info](https://www.WantToKnow.info) website is by far the most popular of the four. Focused on exposing major cover-ups and working together for the good of all, this reliable, revealing website has now had a total of almost 500,000 visits and a million page views in the two years since it was founded. **Currently averaging well over 1,000 visits a day, WantToKnow.info directly inspired a major book ([*The New Pearl Harbor*](https://www.WantToKnow.info/resources#newpearlharbor) by Dr. David Ray Griffin), and has educated and inspired numerous reporters, politicians, and other concerned citizens around the world.** Though not as popular, the other three websites are doing quite well. [Web of Love](https://www.weboflove.org) now averages well over 100 visits a day, while [Moment of Love](https://www.momentoflove.org) and [Global Community for All](https://www.inspiringcommunity.org) both receive about 50 visits a day on average. **All three of these websites are clearly focused on spreading love and inspiration in the world through reminding us of the common humanity we share with all people on this planet, and through inviting us to join together in communities of love and inspiration. **All four of the websites I manage are also a reflection of my deep, unwavering commitment to [what's best for all of us](https://www.weboflove.org/keystolife#whatsbest).

I have a fear that others will see me as pushy or think that somehow I see myself as better or more worthy than them. I have also tended to not trust that others will do the job as well as I could. My [core issue](https://www.WantToKnow.info/coreissue) of arrogance wants me to believe that I can do things better than everyone else, and that I can't trust others to do the job well. I am committed to transforming these weaknesses, and thankfully have made a lot of progress. This email is one example of my commitment to work on these issues. So realizing that this is not easy for me, **I want to warmly invite you to join in supporting my deep commitment to [personal and global transformation through love and empowerment](https://www.weboflove.org/keystolife#love). **There are many ways that you can do this. Financial contributions are one important way you can help.** Whether it's $10 or $1,000, every dollar helps to support the empowering work of these websites.** At this point, we still depend completely on volunteer labor. As contributions have not yet exceeded expenses, we are a few hundred dollars in the red. Other than our website designer (who was paid $300 for his many long hours of great work), no one has ever been paid anything for the many thousands of hours of work that have gone into these websites. I personally spend over 40 hours a week on this labor of love. Since resigning from my interpreting work at the State Department last November, I have had no income. Though I am drawing on limited funds I had put away towards retirement temporarily to sustain me, I am hopeful that with your support, I will be able to compensate myself and eventually others who are deeply dedicated to developing and promoting this empowering work.

I've become friends with Rich and Yvonne, the loving couple who founded this deeply inspiring program many years ago. Challenge Day has transformed many lives across the United States and Canada. Hundreds of testimonials every year come in from teenagers witnessing to how this one-day program dramatically changed their lives. Some have even commented that before Challenge Day they had been seriously contemplating suicide, but now see meaning and real possibilities in their lives. **Challenge Day is a one-day program offered in hundreds of high schools and junior highs every year which opens students to seeing their common humanity in a way that is simply miraculous.** **It is not uncommon by the end of the day to find rival gang members hugging each other and saying I'm sorry, even with tears in their eyes. \"I am truly sorry to the millions of people I have picked on,\" commented a former school bully as he hugged a gangly boy he had tormented for several years.** I challenge you to watch the 15-minute Emmy award-winning video clip [available here](https://www.personalgrowthcourses.net/video/challenge_day) and see if you aren't moved and inspired by this life-changing program.** ** For more information on this empowering work, you can contact me, or explore the engaging material on the Challenge Day website at [http://www.challengeday.org](http://www.challengeday.org) Thank you very much for being a part of my community.

My second question, Mr. Secretary: **according to the Comptroller General of the United States, there are serious financial management problems at the Pentagon**, to which Mr. Cooper alluded. **Fiscal Year 1999: $2.3 trillion missing. ** **Fiscal Year 2000, $1.1 trillion missing. ** **And DoD is the number one reason why the government can't balance its checkbook**. The Pentagon has claimed year after year that the reason it can't account for the money is because its computers don't communicate with each other. My second question, Mr. Secretary, is who has the contracts today, to make those systems communicate with each other? How long have they had those contracts, and how much have the taxpayers paid for them? Finally Mr. Secretary, after the last Hearing, **I thought that my office was promised a written response to my question regarding the four wargames on September 11th. I have not yet received that response, but would like for you to respond to the questions that I've put to you today.** And then I do expect the written response to my previous question - hopefully by the end of the week. 27:26 DR: Thank you, Representative. First, the answer to your first question is, is, no, absolutely not, the policy of the United States Government is clear, unambiguous, and opposed to the activities that you described. The second question - CMK: Well how do you explain the fact that DynCorp and its successor companies have received and continue to receive government contracts? DR: I would have to go and find the facts, but there are laws and rules and regulations with respect to government contracts, and there are times that corporations do things they should not do, in which case they tend to be suspended for some period; there are times then that the - under the laws and the rules and regulations for the - passed by the Congress and", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:050317wargames911.txt:1:b8e8b06e9880", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 7278, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "050317wargames911.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "050317wargames911", "chunk_index": 2, "text": "its successor companies have received and continue to receive government contracts?

DR: The second question - I've forgotten what the second question was. CMK: I think Ms. Jonas knows it. DR: Okay. 29:00 TJ: Thank you Ms. McKinney. I appreciate the question and I appreciate your interest in our Department's financial condition. We are working very hard on that program. I've just come back, recently - CMK: I understand that you're working hard on it, but my question was who has the contract? How long have they had that contract, and how much money have we spent on it? TJ: There are - In general **we spend about $20 billion dollars in the Department on information technology systems.** The accounting systems are part of that. I can get you the exact number for the record, of what we spend on our current, what we call \"legacy systems,\" and those that we're moving toward. CMK: And who has the contract? TJ: That would be a multitude of individuals that have - CMK: Could you name some, please? TJ: Well, I think of the top of the, off the top of my head, well, I would rather not; I'd rather provide that for the record. CMK: That's not privileged information, is it? TJ: I'm sure it's not. CMK: Well, please. We still have time, so, please. TJ: I would be glad to provide for the record; I don't want to talk from the top of my head and be incorrect. DR: On your first question, I'm advised by DR. Chu that it was not the corporation that was engaged in the activities you characterized but I'm told it was an employee of the corporation, and it was some years ago in the Balkans that that took place.

CMK: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. DR: We'll get back on both of the first two questions but the Congresswoman has raised the other question twice now, and I'd like to have general Myers respond, because you mentioned it in the last Hearing and I think it'd be helpful to get the answer even though we're on red, if you don't mind, Mr. Chairman? DH: General Myers, go right ahead. CMK: But I would like to have the answer in writing as well, as I thought my office was promised. RM: Okay I don't know about the promise, Congresswoman, but could you repeat the question to make sure I'm answering the right question; this is a 9/11 question. 31:25 CMK: The question was, **we had four wargames going on on September 11th, and the question that I tried to pose before the Secretary had to go to lunch was whether or not the activities of the four wargames going on on September 11th actually impaired our ability to respond to the attacks.** RM: The answer to the question is no, it did not impair our response, in fact General Eberhart who was in the command of the North American Aerospace Defense Command as he testified in front of the 9/11 Commission I believe - I believe he told them that **it enhanced our ability to respond, given that NORAD didn't have the overall responsibility for responding to the attacks that day. That was an FAA responsibility. But they were two CPXs; there was one Department of Justice exercise that didn't have anything to do with the other three; and there was an actual operation ongoing because there was some Russian bomber activity up near Alaska.** So we - CMK: Let me ask you this, then: who was in charge of managing those wargames?

DH: General, why don't you give the best answer that you can here in a short a period of time and we'll - the gentlelady wants to get a written answer anyway, and then we can move on to other folks. **RM: The important thing to realize is that North American Aerospace Defense Command was responsible. These are command post exercises; what that means is that all the battle positions that are normally not filled are indeed filled; so it was an easy transition from an exercise into a real world situation. It actually enhanced the response; otherwise, it would take somewhere between 30 minutes and a couple of hours to fill those positions, those battle stations, with the right staff officers.** CMK: Mr. Chairman, begging your indulgence, was September Eleventh declared a National Security Special Event day? RM: I have to look back; I do not know. Do you mean after the fact, or CMK: No. Because of the activities going on that had been scheduled at the United Nations that day. RM: I'd have to go back and check. I don't know. **What you can do:** Inform your media and political representatives of this vital information on 9/11 war games.

Hillenkoetter quoted in the *New York Times*, 2/28/1960, [click here](https://www.WantToKnow.info/600228nytimes) to access this article in the *New York Times* archives. Dear friends, I am deeply committed to sharing meaningful, reliable information as it is revealed to me. Some have suggested that talking about UFOs threatens the reputation of the high quality research of the WantToKnow.info team. Yet when we have solid, reliable testimony from several generals, admirals, a former director of the CIA, and many other highly respected, reliable sources, we feel it is important to share this information with those who want to know the truth, no matter how disturbing it might be. Below are quotes from three of these highly respected individuals. The first, Admiral Lord Hill-Norton, was from 1971 to 1973 the supreme commander of the Britain's armed forces (see [UK Ministry of Defence](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Hill-Norton,_Baron_Hill-Norton) website). From 1974 to 1977, he was chairman of the NATO Military Committee (see [NATO](http://www.nato.int/cv/milcom/chair.htm) website). The second is Apollo astronaut Dr. Edgar Mitchell - one of the very few to walk on the moon (see [NASA](http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/ap11ann/astrobios.htm#other)). Dr. Mitchell also founded of the highly esteemed Institute of Noetic Sciences (see [IONS founder](http://www.noetic.org/about/founder.cfm)). Both of these men have given video testimony on a major cover-up of UFOs. The quotes below are from the transcript of this testimony. To order the video tape of their testimony (along with that of numerous other government and military witnesses) [click here](http://www.disclosureproject.org/shop.htm#Disclosure 2HR Video). The transcript of their testimony is also recorded along with the testimony of 60 other government and military witnesses in the book *Disclosure*. To order, [click here](http://www.disclosureproject.org/shop.htm#Disclosure Book). The third witness is former director of the CIA, Roscoe H. Hillenkoetter (see [CIA website](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roscoe_H._Hillenkoetter) for description). His testimony, provided in the quote above, is taken from the March 28, 1960 edition of the *New York Times*.

Governments fear that if they did disclose those facts, people would panic. I don't believe that at all. There is a serious possibility that we are being visited-and have been visited for many years-by people from outer space, from other civilizations. It behooves us to find out who they are, where they come from, and what they want. This should be the subject of rigorous scientific investigation, and not the subject of rubbishing by tabloid newspapers.

There have been crashed craft. There have been material and bodies recovered. There has been a certain amount of reverse engineering that has allowed some of these craft, or some components, to be duplicated. And there is some group of people that may or may not be associated with government at this point, but certainly were at one time, that have this knowledge. They have been attempting to conceal this knowledge or not permit it to be widely disseminated. People in high-level government have very little, if any, valid information about this. Most have no more knowledge than the man in the street. [As to] the question, \"How could it be kept secret?\" It hasn't been kept secret. It's been there all along. But it has been the subject of disinformation in order to deflect attention and create confusion so the truth doesn't come out.

Armen Victorian's [*Mind Controllers*](https://www.amazon.com/Lewis-N-Clark-Mind-Controllers/dp/0966677196/) is one that gives an excellent overview of the subject. A 10-page summary of this eye-opening book, which includes hundreds of footnotes for verification purposes, is available on [this webpage](https://www.WantToKnow.info/mindcontrollers10pg). The summary of a key patent given below describes technology used for behavior modification through TV, computer monitors, video, and DVD programming. And it can most certainly be applied to our cell phones, too. If you have a science background, consider reading the full [16-page patent](https://patents.google.com/patent/US6506148) to see the high level of sophistication involved.** The manipulation is not done through the insertion of single-frame anomalies, as has been done in the past, but rather by modulation of the feed or signal.** It is unfortunate that very few are aware of these subliminal behavior modification capabilities. With limited regulatory oversight and no way of knowing how much these technologies are being used by the military, corporations, and even foreign entities to manipulate our thoughts and emotions, we have to ask how much the public is being secretly influenced to achieve hidden agendas. It is well known that the police are [using related technologies for crowd control](https://www.wanttoknow.info/050708nonlethalweapons). Yet it is also likely that corporations are using these methods to manipulate our emotions in ways that increase profits. Like any tool, these technologies can be used for either the benefit or detriment of society. As the media is not covering this vitally important topic, it is up to us to spread the word and demand accountability for this dangerous technology. **Let us call for open public discussion on these vital matters.

Many computer monitors and TV tubes, when displaying pulsed images, emit pulsed electromagnetic fields of sufficient amplitudes to cause such excitation. **It is therefore possible to manipulate the nervous system of a subject by pulsing images displayed on a nearby computer monitor or TV set. For the latter, the image pulsing may be imbedded in the program material, or it may be overlaid by modulating a video stream, either as an RF signal or as a video signal. The image displayed on a computer monitor may be pulsed effectively by a simple computer program. ** For certain monitors, pulsed electromagnetic fields capable of exciting sensory resonances in nearby subjects may be generated even as the displayed images are pulsed with subliminal intensity. Inventors: Loos; Hendricus G. (Laguna Beach, CA) Appl. No.: 872528 Filed: June 1, 2001 **SUMMARY ** **Computer monitor and TV monitors can be made to emit weak low-frequency electromagnetic fields merely by pulsing the intensity of displayed images.** Experiments have shown that the 1/2 Hz sensory resonance can be excited in this manner in a subject near the monitor. The 2.4 Hz sensory resonance can also be excited in this fashion. Hence, a TV monitor or computer monitor can be used to manipulate the nervous system of nearby people. **The implementations of the invention are adapted to the source of video stream that drives the monitor, be it a computer program, a TV broadcast, a video tape or a digital video disc (DVD).** For a computer monitor, the image pulses can be produced by a suitable computer program. The pulse frequency may be controlled through keyboard input, so that the subject can tune to an individual sensory resonance frequency. The pulse amplitude can be controlled as well in this manner. A program written in Visual Basic(R) is particularly suitable for use on computers that run the Windows 95(R) or Windows 98(R) operating system. The structure of such a program is described.

The pulse frequency may be controlled through keyboard input, so that the subject can tune to an individual sensory resonance frequency. The pulse amplitude can be controlled as well in this manner. A program written in Visual Basic(R) is particularly suitable for use on computers that run the Windows 95(R) or Windows 98(R) operating system. The structure of such a program is described. Production of periodic pulses requires an accurate timing procedure. Such a procedure is constructed from the GetTimeCount function available in the Application Program Interface (API) of the Windows operating system, together with an extrapolation procedure that improves the timing accuracy. Pulse variability can be introduced through software, for the purpose of thwarting habituation of the nervous system to the field stimulation, or when the precise resonance frequency is not known. The variability may be a pseudo-random variation within a narrow interval, or it can take the form of a frequency or amplitude sweep in time. The pulse variability may be under control of the subject. **The program that causes a monitor to display a pulsing image may be run on a remote computer that is connected to the user computer by a link; the latter may partly belong to a network, which may be the Internet. ** **For a TV monitor, the image pulsing may be inherent in the video stream as it flows from the video source, or else the stream may be modulated such as to overlay the pulsing. In the first case, a live TV broadcast can be arranged to have the feature imbedded simply by slightly pulsing the illumination of the scene that is being broadcast. This method can of course also be used in making movies and recording video tapes and DVDs. ** Video tapes can be edited such as to overlay the pulsing by means of modulating hardware. A simple modulator is discussed wherein the luminance signal of composite video is pulsed without affecting the chroma signal. The same effect may be introduced at the consumer end, by modulating the video stream that is produced by the video source. A DVD can be edited through software, by introducing pulse-like variations in the digital RGB signals. Image intensity pulses can be overlaid onto the analog component video output of a DVD player by modulating the luminance signal component. Before entering the TV set, a television signal can be modulated such as to cause pulsing of the image intensity by means of a variable delay line that is connected to a pulse generator. **Certain monitors can emit electromagnetic field pulses that excite a sensory resonance in a nearby subject, through image pulses that are so weak as to be subliminal.

With the use of powerful computers, segments of human emotions which include anger, anxiety, sadness, fear, embarrassment, jealousy, resentment, shame, and terror, have been identified and isolated within the EEG signals as 'emotion signature clusters.' Their relevant frequencies and amplitudes have been measured. Then the very frequency/amplitude cluster is synthesized and stored on another computer. Each one of these negative emotions is properly and separately tagged. They are then placed on the Silent Sound carrier frequencies and could silently trigger the occurrence of the same basic emotion in another human being. **Note: **To understand how this is technically possible, read brief descriptions of U.S. patents below. **Other Key Behavior Modification and Mind Control Patents **(Click link to read full patent) USP # [3,951,134](https://patents.google.com/patent/US3951134) (April 20, 1976), **Apparatus & Method for Remotely Monitoring & Altering Brain Waves** **Abstract:** Apparatus for and method of sensing brain waves at a position remote from a subject whereby electromagnetic signals of different frequencies are simultaneously transmitted to the brain of the subject in which the signals interfere with one another to yield a waveform which is modulated by the subject's brain waves.

To understand the reasoning for the suppression, I highly recommend our summary of highly decorated US General Smedley Butler's book *War is a Racket* at [https://www.WantToKnow.info/warcoverup](https://www.WantToKnow.info/warcoverup). General Butler gives an insiders perspective on how powerful economic forces promote war for reasons of profit while ignoring the very serious consequences to the many military and civilian lives affected. **Let us all do what we can to call for the prominent publication of the scientific studies on depleted uranium which have been suppressed.** Please help to spread the word on this important topic by forwarding this information to your friends and colleagues.

His older son Joe was hospitalized with breathing problems the day after Wheat dragged his contaminated gear into the house. Derrick, his youngest son, who was born after the war, suffers strange blisters on his hands. His wife suffered a miscarriage. Jerry himself recently had a tumour removed from his shoulder.

The study by three leading radiation scientists cautioned that children and adults could contract cancer after breathing in dust containing DU, which is radioactive and chemically toxic. But** it was blocked from publication by the World Health Organisation (WHO), which employed the main author, Dr Keith Baverstock, as a senior radiation advisor. He alleges that it was deliberately suppressed, though this is denied by WHO.** Baverstock also believes that if the study had been published when it was completed in 2001, there would have been more pressure on the US and UK to limit their use of DU weapons in last year's war, and to clean up afterwards. Hundreds of thousands of DU shells were fired by coalition tanks and planes during the conflict, and there has been no comprehensive decontamination. Experts from the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) have so far not been allowed into Iraq to assess the pollution. **For more information**, The *Christian Science Monitor* has a compilation of 16 articles exposing the dangers of depleted uranium at [http://www.csmonitor.com/atcsmonitor/specials/uranium/](http://www.csmonitor.com/atcsmonitor/specials/uranium/) BBC also has a webpage listing 10 of their articles both pro and con regarding depleted uranium at [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/in_depth/europe/2001/depleted_uranium/default.stm](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/in_depth/europe/2001/depleted_uranium/default.stm) **See our [exceptional archive](https://www.WantToKnow.info/indexnewsarticles) of revealing news articles.** **Please support this important work: [Donate here](https://www.WantToKnow.info/donationswtk.php)** Explore the mind", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:050405depleteduranium.txt:1:fd695cc37e78", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 7297, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "050405depleteduranium.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "050405depleteduranium", "chunk_index": 2, "text": "comprehensive decontamination.

Why aren't we pouring large amounts of research dollars into a serious study of these cases to determine how the likelihood of such occurrences can be increased? Thankfully, a few scientists are risking the ridicule of their colleagues in undertaking the serious study of such topics. **For two excellent, inspiring books which document fascinating studies into the power of the mind, see [*The Field*](https://www.WantToKnow.info/resources#field) by Lynne McTaggart and [*The Holographic Universe*](https://www.WantToKnow.info/resources#holographic) by Michael Talbot.** Let us all do what we can to support this important work.

As an organic chemist with a major pharmaceutical company, he was on a good salary, developing a new generation of drugs by synthesising molecules found in nature. But Hamilton was never convinced that man could improve on nature, and instead was becoming more and more fascinated by the potential healing power of the mind. So, inspired by his body's ability to withstand heat during fire-walking, he began a quest to investigate the mysteries of the mind-body connection. He also began hosting seminars where he encouraged people to believe in the power of their", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:050410powerofthemind.txt:0:f5ec517bfd38", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 7299, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "050410powerofthemind.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "050410powerofthemind", "chunk_index": 1, "text": "good salary, developing a new generation of drugs by synthesising molecules found in nature. But Hamilton was never convinced that man could improve on nature, and instead was becoming more and more fascinated by the potential healing power of the mind. So, inspired by his body's ability to withstand heat during fire-walking, he began a quest to investigate the mysteries of the mind-body connection. He also began hosting seminars where he encouraged people to believe in the power of their mind to positively improve their health. Unlike many self-help gurus, Hamilton backs his arguments with scientific research and combines his work with a post as a part-time lecturer in chemistry at Glasgow University. In his first book, *It's The Thought That Counts*, due to be published next year, he will put forward the scientific arguments about the mysterious mind-body connection and argue that powerful human states such as happiness and optimism can actually change your DNA. \"I'm interested in the whole self-improvement thing but I am the only scientist talking about it,\" he says. His interest in the power of the human spirit began when he was working as an organic chemist for a major pharmaceutical company. Put in the fast-track by the company because of his skill in the field, Hamilton worked on creating new drugs by re-creating molecular structures found in nature with slight differences in order to develop new drugs. \"You study nature's molecules and re-create them slightly differently,\" he says. \"The idea is to take nature and improve on it.\" However, he was not sure that was the right approach. He was also becoming uneasy about the way pharmaceutical companies were operating, particularly in the developing world, and became fascinated by the placebo effect, the scientific principle which shows that in drug trials, people given sugar pills often recover just as well as those on other medication. \"On average, placebo effects cure anything between 30 to 90%. That has been written up in many scientific journals. I thought, 'Why not see if you could extend it',\" he says. On a weekend retreat with [Tony Robbins](http://www.tonyrobbins.com/), the pioneer of fire-walking, Hamilton decided it was time to change his course in life. \"When you walk on fire for the first time you feel incredibly euphoric. At the end of it I felt like I could do anything, and, more specifically, that I could live my dream.\" He set up New Awakenings, giving talks and workshops about the power of the mind over the body. While many new-age types talk about positive thinking, Hamilton is different, in that he gives listeners a view based on the latest developments in chemistry, biology and physics. By presenting arguments backed by science, he hopes to motivate people to work on their minds in order to improve their health: \"With faith, hope and determination people can change the state of their health, life", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:050410powerofthemind.txt:1:db61a64a02d7", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 7300, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "050410powerofthemind.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "050410powerofthemind", "chunk_index": 2, "text": "up New Awakenings, giving talks and workshops about the power of the mind over the body.

By presenting arguments backed by science, he hopes to motivate people to work on their minds in order to improve their health: \"With faith, hope and determination people can change the state of their health, life and world\". \"I have found around 500 scientific papers from mainstream academic journals which directly talk about the effect that thought, feeling and faith have on the body's systems,\" he says. Recent research into spontaneous remissions from cancer found that a radical change of belief system seemed to be a common factor. While few would argue with the idea that a good attitude can speed the healing process, Hamilton believes emotions, such as happiness, can change DNA. What is surprising is that a growing body of scientific thought appears to agree with him. As an example, Hamilton quotes the work of Eric Kandel, joint winner of the 2000 Nobel prize for medicine, who carried out pioneering work into the way genes can be switched on or off by social influences. Kandel's conclusion is that many genetic differences between people are influenced by society and conditioning, rather than incorporated in the genetic makeup of the parents. Hamilton says: \"About 99.9 per cent of our genes are exactly the same. The differences between us are determined by whether our genes are switched on or off. \"There is a whole branch of medicine called psycho-neuro-immunology, which studies the effect of thoughts and emotions on our biochemistry. The biochemistry is intimately connected with the DNA, so if these biologichemical components are affected by thoughts and emotions then thoughts and emotions must also affect our DNA.\" He also cites a well-known scientific study of rat pups which showed that two separate growth hormones are switched off in those deprived of a mother's touch. By pulling together the evidence that love and kindness can have a positive effect on health, Hamilton hopes to make people more aware of their own healing power. \"The most powerful cure for anything is faith, hope and determination.\" **See our collection of inspirational stories at [https://www.WantToKnow.info/medianewsarticles#inspiration](https://www.WantToKnow.info/medianewsarticles#inspiration)** Your tax-deductible donations, however large or small, help greatly to support this important work.

Yet as the US Mandarin interpreter missed her plane, and as I also speak fluent Mandarin, I receive a late night call asking me to interpret the next morning for a meeting with the Chinese delegation. Waiting in the receiving room that morning, I watch Chinese Premier Li Peng get incredibly upset that Gore (who is finishing up a meeting with an African president in the adjacent room) is not there to greet him several minutes before the appointed meeting time. The premier storms out of the receiving room with his entourage two minutes *before* the scheduled time, exclaiming to US officials that Gore's tardiness is an insult and an outrage. \"If Gore wants to meet with me,\" Li Peng blares, \"he can come to my office.\" The Chinese delegation's offices are located far across the pavilion. To avoid an international incident, a very tired Gore runs across the huge compound, much to the consternation of the Secret Service, to meet with the upset Chinese. **Oct. 26, 1995 - White House meeting with Clinton, Gore, Indonesian President Suharto** In bargaining about the potential sale of a fleet of F-16 fighter jets to Indonesia, President Suharto claims, \"We're just a poor country.\" Al Gore", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:050418fredburksinterpretingstories.txt:0:a4c47de08e1b", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 7303, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "050418fredburksinterpretingstories.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "050418fredburksinterpretingstories", "chunk_index": 1, "text": "come to my office.\" The Chinese delegation's offices are located far across the pavilion.

I am impressed when a White House secretary tells me that President Clinton knows the names of the kids of all the many White House secretaries. He is very well liked by his staff. His advisor hounds him immediately after Suharto leaves with suggestions on how he could have done better and what to do next. **June 23, 1997 - US Marine Corps Commandant General Charles Krulak meets Indonesian counterpart General Suharto (not the president)** At a special dinner in General Krulak's personal residence, a three-star US general tells of several amazing experiences he witnessed in a visit with Indonesia's special [psychic forces](https://www.WantToKnow.info/mindcontrollers10pg#psychic). Among other amazing feats, he saw Indonesian troops on motorcycles successfully ride blind-folded through an obstacle course. He also hid a coin in a large grass field where he couldn't have relocated it himself, yet psychic troops who had not seen him hide the coin were able to immediately locate it. General Krulak laughs all this off as psychic nonsense. Another U.S. general brags about the U.S. military's sophisticated radar system at Cheyenne Mountain being so proficient that it could detect any unusual object anywhere in U.S. airspace and have fighter jets up on it in 10 minutes or less. **February 13, 1998 - Clinton/Suharto phone call** The call starts with several Indonesian advisors consulting among themselves about the content of the call. Then President Clinton joins in with the advisors to hear their recommendations. After conferring, President Suharto is called, and Clinton and Suharto converse with all listening. After the conversation, Clinton debriefs with his advisors. Clinton then hangs up, and the advisors discuss further on their own (contrast with President G.W. Bush who never used any advisors on the three calls I did with him). Due to a party with all my best friends on my 40th birthday, I miss interpreting for a second call a week later. **Sept. 30 - Oct. 1, 1998 - Chiefs of Defense Conference, Honolulu** The most secret meeting at this conference is a one-hour discussion attended only by the top military chiefs of the 20 Pacific Rim nations represented and the few assigned interpreters. Nothing remotely resembling cover-up or conspiracy is discussed. These top generals and admirals focus largely on how they can better work together to provide regional security. **March 4 - 5,", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:050418fredburksinterpretingstories.txt:1:1df954e3506c", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 7304, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "050418fredburksinterpretingstories.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "050418fredburksinterpretingstories", "chunk_index": 2, "text": "interpreting for a second call a week later. **Sept. 30 - Oct. 1, 1998 - Chiefs of Defense Conference, Honolulu** The most secret meeting at this conference is a one-hour discussion attended only by the top military chiefs of the 20 Pacific Rim nations represented and the few assigned interpreters. Nothing remotely resembling cover-up or conspiracy is discussed. These top generals and admirals focus largely on how they can better work together to provide regional security. **March 4 - 5, 1999 - Secretary of State Albright with President Habibie, others** There is lots of wrangling with numerous last minute changes before Albright is finally allowed to meet with East Timorese rebel leader Xanana Gusmao. She has to meet with pro-Indonesian Timorese before they agree to let her meet Gusmao. Her 26-hour visit keeps 60 US embassy staff busy for weeks. I only spend about 30 minutes actually interpreting, though I am present for most meetings in the event a non-English speaking participant should speak. During the time I sit quietly in these many meetings, I focus on sending love to these leaders and inviting them to open to what is best for all of us. In a meeting with (future president) Megawati, Assistant Secretary of State Stanley Roth asks me to speak louder, but also highly compliments my work stating, \"Albright wants to hire you.\" These two women leaders thoroughly enjoy their brief conversation. Because of the long travel times involved, I receive payment for six days of work at over $400/day. **April 2000 - Armandina Gusmao and other East Timor (Timor Leste) Leaders ** During a one-month study tour of the US, the future East Timorese President's sister, Armandina, shares with me a number of incredibly inspiring stories of narrow escapes and spiritual protection she received while under arrest. She was under threat of murder and rape several times. She told of being friends with the wife of East Timor's Indonesian governor, all the while sending important information she received from the governor's wife and others to her brother's secret rebel base. During one meeting with Armandina on this visit, a top former UN official describes corruption at the highest levels of the UN East Timorese mission, which is preventing a truly representative democracy from being established there. He lost his job for exposing what he found. **Sept. 18 - 21, 2001 - Indonesian President Megawati's visit to White House, more** Only a week after the 9/11 attacks, Indonesian President Megawati Soekarnoputri meets with US President Bush in the Oval office. She also meets Vice President Dick Cheney, US Trade Representative Robert Zoellick, Secretary of State Colin Powell, the House International Relations Committee, women senators Boxer, Feinstein, and Carnahan, Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neil, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, World Bank Director James Wolfenson, National Security Advisor Condoleezza Rice, IMF Managing Director Horst Kohler, and Henry Kissinger.

Before our first meeting, President Megawati's main interpreter asks me to take his place and interpret for him. I tell him that this is strictly against protocol. After pressuring me several other times with no success, he finally exclaims with exasperation, \"Megawati doesn't like me.\" In the end I agree, and end up interpreting for both sides in many meetings. Megawati always speaks in Indonesian at these meetings. Though she can speak and understand English fairly well, she sometimes misunderstands, which can lead to embarrassing situations. Her personal friend Karen Brooks, the Director for Asian Affairs of the National Security Council (NSC), convinces Megawati to allow me to whisper simultaneously into her ear, so that whenever she misses something in English, she can catch what was said in my interpretation. This works beautifully throughout the three-day visit. **Oval Office meeting between presidents.** I am given the talking points the previous day by NSC Asian Affairs Director Karen Brooks. As this is only one week after the 9/11 attacks, terrorism accounts for about half of the topics to be discussed. However, the other topics include long, detailed information on Indonesia. I ask Karen how President Bush will be able to discuss such detailed topics on Indonesia, to which she responds, \"I don't know.\" At the meeting itself, President Bush uses no notes or prompting during their 90-minute conversation, yet covers all topics very well! This is highly unusual. I could not have done it. Did he possibly use an earpiece? (for more on this, [click here](https://www.WantToKnow.info/bushearphone)) As we prepare to bid farewell after a short stroll through the White House, President Bush makes eye contact with me, expresses his gratitude, shakes my hand, and comments \"Good job.\" I sense a sincere warmth. During a photo-op before the Oval Office meeting, a White House official insists I stand in the wrong position, yet this ends up putting me on national television that evening. **Pre-banquet private meeting.** 40 top US industry CEOs talk for about two minutes each. Each of them lectures President Megawati on what they think she should do to stimulate investment in her country. Yet amazingly, Megawati is given absolutely no time to respond! This is culturally very inappropriate, tantamount to an insult. **World Bank President James Wolfenson**.

At one point in this meeting, Wolfenson states, \"My assistants won't support me in this, but I recommend you focus on small and medium-size domestic industry.\" **Special flight to New York City to meet with Kissinger. **President Megawati meets only with the top echelon of leaders in her three-day visit to the US. Yet the government arranges to have her make a special flight to New York for a one-hour meeting with Henry Kissinger. Very strange. I am not included in this one. He is obviously still very powerful. After one inspiring meeting during this visit, a congressman comments to me, \"I wish I could communicate with my wife the way you do with Megawati.\" As we near the conclusion of Megawati's US visit, one Indonesian minister in the delegation invites me to his home. Another offers vital information, and a couple Indonesian officials even suggest the possibility of hiring me to interpret for Megawati in future. **Sept. 16, 2002 - Secret Meeting with President Megawati in her home** I receive a call on Friday asking if I can take a flight the next day to interpret at a secret meeting in Indonesia. Present at the meeting are US Ambassador to Indonesia Ralph Boyce, NSC expert Karen Brooks, and a CIA agent presented as a \"Special Assistant to the President.\" They pressure Megawati to \"render\" (secretly capture and turn over) Abu Bakar Ba'asyir, who is accused by the US of being the mastermind behind Jemaah Islamiah, which is suspected to be a sister organization to Al Qaeda. The \"Special Assistant\" states that through the confessions of Omar al-Faruq, who Indonesia previously rendered to the US, they now have proof Ba'asyir attempted to assassinate Megawati twice. Megawati responds that she can't fulfill their request as Ba'asyir is too well known (he's something like a Muslim version of Jerry Falwell or Pat Robertson in US). After the US team puts further pressure on her, she states that she could do this \"only if public support of him were to change.\" The special assistant responds with an apparent threat, \"There will be problems if Ba'asyir is not rendered by the APEC meeting,\" which will take place in six weeks. President Megawati's response: \"I hope this doesn't lead to a severing of the good relations between our two countries.\" The US team is quite surprised by this response. They later ask me to confirm that this is what she actually said. The intelligence shared with Megawati in this meeting and much more is leaked to *Time*, who puts the", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:050418fredburksinterpretingstories.txt:4:4b9f1698e6ba", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 7307, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "050418fredburksinterpretingstories.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "050418fredburksinterpretingstories", "chunk_index": 5, "text": "threat, \"There will be problems if Ba'asyir is not rendered by the APEC meeting,\" which will take place in six weeks.

They later ask me to confirm that this is what she actually said. The intelligence shared with Megawati in this meeting and much more is leaked to *Time*, who puts the story on the front page of their Sept. 23rd issue. Karen Brooks thinks Indonesian intelligence leaked this classified information, as they were also briefed. I witness the many layers of secrecy in the US embassy. Heavy barricades around the embassy show just how defensive the US government has become. **Funny story.** In my hurry to pack and leave for this meeting, for the first time I forgot to pack my dress shirts on this trip. As I had a day in Indonesia before the scheduled meeting, I ran out and bought new shirts, but hadn't yet ironed them. While working in casual clothes at the embassy, I was told there had been a sudden plan change, that we were going to have the meeting \"now!\" instead of next day. When I told an embassy official that my clothes weren't ready, he looked at me, asked the size of my neck, waist, chest, inseam... I ended up wearing his suit to the meeting, which amazingly was a perfect fit!!! This is quite a miracle for someone who is six feet four inches tall! Then on Oct. 12th, the Bali bombing. 202 lives are taken. Australia loses more than any other nation with 88 killed. The Australian government and public, which had previously been quite resistant, instantly changes to support the US war on terror. The bombing is pinned on Ba'asyir by US intelligence, who claims Ba'asyir is the head of Jemaah Islamiah (JI). This leads to Ba'asyir's arrest and imprisonment, easily within the six-week timeframe given at the secret meeting. This is all very convenient for the US. A little too convenient in my opinion. Many in Indonesia doubt the US intelligence backing these claims. So do I. US officials continually deny putting any pressure on Indonesia regarding Ba'asyir.

The UK's Blair and Germany's Schroeder are the only major leaders unable to attend. Among those present are Jacque Chirac of France, PM Junichiro Koizumi of Japan, Premier Zhu Rongji of China, PM Silvio Berlusconi of Italy, and Pres. Kim Dae-Jung of Korea. Their conversation is highly critical of the US desire for war in Iraq. Berlusconi, recently back from a Camp David visit with President Bush, is the only one who stands to support the US in its desire for a war on Iraq. Chiraq immediately berates him for coddling up to power. Berlusconi sheepishly stands up and apologizes. 52 interpreters representing 17 languages facilitated the conversation at this summit. According to other interpreters with whom I talked, these summits are almost always boring, but this one is quite fascinating. I was also informed that Denmark's most conservative party is more liberal than the US Democrats. **Oct. 21 - 25, 2002 - High-ranking Indonesian police** At a high-level conference held just outside Washington, DC, a three-star US intelligence general tells top Indonesian police officials, \"Everything I say is true.\" Shortly afterward, he states, \"There are no CIA agents in Indonesia.\" The Indonesian police don't believe him. I am informed that one of the best speakers, a US four-star general, quit the military after the Gulf war because of major underhanded deals and secrecy going on, which he saw were clearly not in the interests of the nation. He gives an excellent talk on communication. Our conference is peppered with news of the sniper incident, which unfolds while we meet. In massive shopping sprees, many of these Indonesian police leaders spend well beyond what their salaries would allow. **Oct. 23 - 27, 2002 - APEC in Mexico** Though I was not present, a colleague later relates to me that immediately after the Indonesian delegation left the room at a high-level bilateral meeting, President Bush threw a serious temper tantrum using four-letter words and all. He shouted that he was sick and tired of his job. Not realizing anyone besides his advisors were in the room, as soon as Bush turned and saw that my colleague was there in a corner by the refreshments, he instantly transformed into a \"good ol' boy,\" smiling and joking with this colleague. **2003 - Bush/Megawati phone calls Feb 18, Feb 19, and Aug 6** No advisors are used for these calls. For the first call, the White House situation room dials what should be President Megawati's personal phone number, but gets a young-sounding Indonesian woman who immediately complains that she's going to bathroom and hangs up.

For the first call, the White House situation room dials what should be President Megawati's personal phone number, but gets a young-sounding Indonesian woman who immediately complains that she's going to bathroom and hangs up. I only realize later that this is Megawati's answering message, designed to scare away those who might mistakenly call her. Megawati avoids answering the phone at the predetermined time of two calls, tantamount to a polite slap in the face. Though she doesn't say so, she is clearly not happy about President Bush wanting her to support his war in Iraq. Before one of the calls, I ask the White House situation room liaison how long our phone call will last. He guarantees me it will not take more than 15 minutes, as the next call is with the crown prince of Saudi Arabia. He smugly tells me that the crown prince won't wait for President Bush! So who's more important here? **Sept. 23, 2003 - UN General Assembly, Bush and Megawati at Waldorf in New York** While waiting for the Indonesian delegation, President Bush asks Colin Powell, Condoleezza Rice, and Chief of Staff Andrew Card, \"What do you want me to say?\" After the delegation leaves and while waiting for the following African delegation, he again asks what he should talk about. He also cracks some off-color jokes about sex shops in Thailand. **Oct. 22, 2003 - Bali: Bush with Megawati, four religious leaders in a four-hour visit** To arrange for this four-hour stopover, several hundred Americans work in Indonesia at a secure, five-star hotel for a week, and some for several weeks. As I arrive three days early, I am able to see again some of the detailed and scripted planning that goes into these high-level visits. Most of it is about security and making sure the leaders look and sound good to their public. On the morning of the visit, I run into a dead dolphin on the beach near the hotel. Strange omen. I notice during the several meetings how President Bush is very good at making no sound like a yes, particularly in regards to Indonesia's repeated requests for access to Indonesian citizen and suspected terrorist Hambali. Lunch conversation between the two presidents is all about personal stuff-cattle, kids, the difficulties of being a president, etc. Bush again is very nice to me, asking \"Do you want water?\" and \"Aren't you hungry?\" This is rare kindness exhibited by very few for whom I've worked in my many years as an interpreter.

He sees me first and immediately demands to know \"Who is this?\" In fact, I had previously worked with him a couple times. I'm told by a Pentagon staffer that he has become quite paranoid. **Sept. 2004 - Famous Indonesian lawyer Munir assassinated** An incredibly brave human rights lawyer with whom I once traveled for a month is poisoned on a flight to the Netherlands. He dies at age 39. Munir was a member of the human rights commission investigating East Timor atrocities and arguably Indonesia's most famous human rights lawyer. He founded IMPASIAL (Indonesian Human Rights Watch) and KONTRAS (Commission for Missing Persons and Victims of Violence). He was fearless and had many previous death threats. In our time together, he told me that he could be arrested or assassinated at any time because he was one of the very few willing to investigate and pursue some of the deepest cover-ups. He is one of many incredibly brave, inspiring individuals with whom I had the privilege to work. **Nov. 18, 2004 - My Resignation from the State Department** I resign from my work with the State Department (terminate my contract), largely because of a new secrecy clause I would have had to sign in our new contract.

I was quite aware that the two WSJ reporters assigned to this story were tasked with making me look bad, as I had revealed some secrets of the military-industrial establishment. I even told them I was aware of this and asked only that they be honest in their reporting. I feel they did a great job. The article is highly critical of me in places, yet in other parts it is quite praiseworthy. I was particularly thrilled that they even mentioned the websites I manage, including WantToKnow.info. I later learn that both these reporters became fans of my work to [expose major cover-ups](https://www.WantToKnow.info). This article led to numerous other interesting contacts and opportunities.

Although none of them is particularly famous as a scientist -- not one Nobel among them -- they know each other's names and work as well as if they had been working together for 10 years in the same laboratory. They share a painful experience. **Between 1999 and 2001, unbeknownst to the others, each made a simple but dramatic discovery that challenged the catechism of the same powerful industry -- biotechnology -- that by then had become the handmaiden of industrial agriculture and the darling of venture capitalists, who are still hoping they have invested their most recent billions in \"the next big thing.\" ** If any one of the experiments of these four scientists is proved through replication to be valid, the", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:050420gmocoverup.txt:0:75f549008956", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 7314, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "050420gmocoverup.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "050420gmocoverup", "chunk_index": 1, "text": "painful experience. **Between 1999 and 2001, unbeknownst to the others, each made a simple but dramatic discovery that challenged the catechism of the same powerful industry -- biotechnology -- that by then had become the handmaiden of industrial agriculture and the darling of venture capitalists, who are still hoping they have invested their most recent billions in \"the next big thing.\" ** If any one of the experiments of these four scientists is proved through replication to be valid, the already troubled agricultural arm of biotech will be in truly dire straits. No one knows that better than Monsanto, Sygenta and other biotech firms that have so aggressively attacked the four discoveries in question. When he was the principal scientific officer of the Rowett Institute in Aberdeen, Scotland, Hungarian citizen Arpad Pusztai fed transgenically modified [GMO] potatoes to rodents in one of the few experiments that have ever tested the safety of genetically modified food in animals or humans. Almost immediately, the rats displayed tissue and immunological damage. **After he reported his findings, which eventually underwent peer review and were published in the United Kingdom's leading medical journal, Lancet, Pusztai's home was burglarized and his research files taken. ** **Soon thereafter, he was fired from his job at Rowett, and he has since suffered an orchestrated international campaign of discreditation, in which Prime Minister Tony Blair played an active role. ** **While Pusztai was fighting for his professional life, Cornell Professor John Losey was patiently dusting milkweed leaves with genetically modified [GMO] corn pollen. When monarch butterfly larvae that ate the leaves died in significant numbers (while a control group fed non-genetically modified pollen all survived), Losey was not particularly surprised. ** The new gene patched into the butterfly's genome was inserted to produce an internal pesticide, Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt), intended to attack and kill the corn borer and some particularly troublesome moth caterpillars. **What did surprise Losey was the vehement attack on his study that followed from Novartis and Monsanto, their open attempts to discredit his work and the extent to which mass media leapt to their support.** Losey is still at Cornell, where his future seems secure. Not true of Ignacio Chapela, a microbial ecologist in the plant sciences department at UC Berkeley. In 2000, Chapela discovered that pollen had drifted several miles from a field of genetically modified corn in Chiapas into the remote mountains of Oaxaca in Mexico, landing in the last reserve of biodiverse maize in the world.

In his report, Chapela cautiously stated that this indeed might have happened. He expressed that sentiment in a peer-reviewed study published by Nature in November 2001. **After an aggressive public relations campaign mounted for Monsanto by the Bivings Group, a global PR firm that began with a vicious e-mail attack mounted by two \"scientists\" who turned out to be fictitious, Nature editors did something they had never done in their 133 years of existence. They published a cautious partial retraction of the Chapela report. Largely on the strength of that retraction, Chapela was recently denied tenure at UC Berkeley and informed that he would not be reoffered his teaching assignment in the fall.** When Tyrone Hayes, a UC Berkeley endocrinologist specializing in amphibian development, exposed young frogs in his lab to very small doses of the herbicide Atrazine, they first failed to develop normal larynxes and later displayed serious reproductive problems (males became hermaphrodites), suggesting that Atrazine might be an endocrine disrupter. Hayes' subsequent experience differed slightly from the other panelists', but was no less troubling to academic scientists. **As soon as word of Hayes' findings reached Sygenta Corp. (formerly Novartis) and its contractor, Ecorisk Inc., attempts were made to stall his research. Funding was withheld. It was a critical time, as the EPA was close to making a final ruling on Atrazine. Hermaphroditic frogs would not help Sygenta's cause. ** **Hayes continued the research with his own funds and found more of the same results, whereupon Sygenta offered him $2 million to continue his research \"in a private setting.\" A committed teacher with a lab full of loyal students, Hayes declined the offer and proceeded with research that he knew had to remain in public domain.** This time he found damaging developmental effects of Atrazine at even lower levels (0.1 parts per billion). When his work appeared in the prestigious Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, Sygenta attacked the study and claimed that three other labs it contracted had been unable to duplicate Hayes' results. Hayes, who keeps his head down on the Berkeley campus, has obtained tenure and continues to teach. But his studies that could affect approval of the most widely used chemical in U.S. agriculture are being stifled at every turn. **In a public conversation attended by 500 people and Webcast to 4,000 more worldwide recently on the Berkeley campus, Pusztai, Losey, Hayes and Chapela shared their experiences and together explored ways to prevent similar fates from ever happening to their peers. Their similar stories provide a unique window into a disturbing trend in modern science.** None of the four complained that his science had been challenged, although in each case it", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:050420gmocoverup.txt:2:9b037e6d4356", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 7316, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "050420gmocoverup.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "050420gmocoverup", "chunk_index": 3, "text": "in U.S. agriculture are being stifled at every turn. **In a public conversation attended by 500 people and Webcast to 4,000 more worldwide recently on the Berkeley campus, Pusztai, Losey, Hayes and Chapela shared their experiences and together explored ways to prevent similar fates from ever happening to their peers.

All science is and should be challenged. No one knows that better than a practicing scientist, who also knows that if tenure depended on a perfect experimental record, there would be very few tenured scientists anywhere in the world. **These four men were not attacked because of flawed or imperfect experiments but because the findings of their work have a potential economic effect. The sad part is that the academies and other allegedly independent institutions that once defended scientific freedom and protected employees like Hayes, Chapela, Losey and Pusztai are abandoning them to the wolves of commerce, the brands of which are being engraved over the entrances to a disturbing number of university labs.** Mark Dowie lives in Point Reyes and teaches a science writing class at UC Graduate School of Journalism.

Millions are being magnificent...\" ** -- Bill Francis, 1/20/05 April 26, 2005 Dear friends, Below is an incredibly inspiring story of healing and rebuilding in the wake of last December's devastating tsunami. Those who have subscribed since early January will remember [the moving story](https://www.WantToKnow.info/disasterbreedsheroes) of my inspiring friend Bill Francis, who was traveling in Thailand when the tsunami struck. Bill dropped everything to dedicate himself first to the emergency relief effort, where he coordinated a team of over 300 foreigner volunteers. Then, he set out to the arduous task of repairing or replacing the damaged and destroyed fishing boats of several villages on the Thai coast. Today I received an email from Bill that the work is completed. Thanks to over $60,000 in donations from you and many others around the world (US dollars go a long way in Thailand), Bill and his team successfully repaired or replaced 130 boats in eight villages. Some of these oceanside villages relied heavily on their fishing boats for their livelihood. Bill and friends made a huge difference in these people's lives. For some colorful photos of this most amazing accomplishment, see the link below. May we all step up to our own magnificence not only in times of disaster, but as often as we can. Take care and have a great day and week ahead!

Yet I've spent over a week hiding from my computer. It tripped me this morning, hijacked my fingers and I'm typing. I don't want us to be done on Ko Lanta, yet we are. We succeeded beyond, way beyond our original goals. Remember the vision? Bring on a wave of human kindness and light bright enough to wash away the dark terror of December 26th 2004. Well, I wish you could see their faces, my friends, family, benefactors, contributors, prayer partners, supporters and angels. Men cried in gratitude. Stoic seafaring men hugged me openly in public.

We were action, not just noisy wind. There was plenty of that, still is. Some people spell wind: g o v e r n m e n t. God Bless you Cin, Mai, Pui, Mr. Pop, Mr. Virat, Mr. Sak and Mr. Schem, Mr. Wut, P Ah and our webmaster in America, Dave Dewey. How do I thank you? I cannot - your selfless diligence, loving labor, and the restored lives of hundreds thank you beyond anything I can say. I'm amazed at what you all, but particularly Mai, endured and never gave up. Wow. Locals said we helped 10,000 people! While that's a wild exaggeration (there aren't that many people here), you get the idea. 2000 comes closer - but that's not important. The whole point is we helped restore individual lives and families, not numbers. Somehow we aided everyone who asked, and many who didn't. Here are some numbers for those who like them: Village Repaired Replaced Total Nai Rai 31 4 35 Klong Dao 34 7 41 KO Por 32 6 38 Pra Ae 4 0 4 Klong Jak 1 0 1 Klong Kong 6 3 9 Saladan 0 1 1 Old Town 0 1(partial) 1 Totals: 108 22 130 We bought 13 brand new engines, a number of used engines, power tools, a bunch of \"long tails\", a couple of gas tanks, and a whopping 150,000 baht worth of fishing nets. We repaired a Spirit House and gave a little cash to two very poor hungry families. Ours is an international miracle when I think about it. We're from the United States, Canada, Mexico, Spain, France, Germany, Sweden, Switzerland, The Netherlands, Romania, and Australia! Our combined donation was $62,162.92 U.S. dollars. That's 2,374,596 Thai Baht. I remain humbled and thankful for the trust you placed in me. Do you realize this would not have happened without your personal contribution? I do. Thank you. One kind soul from Europe allowed me to use some of her funds to cover living expenses for Cin, Mai and myself. I am deeply grateful. You know who you are, thank you. We spent an average of about $478.18 per boat. That's misleading, as we spent $11,000 on engines alone.

We spent an average of about $478.18 per boat. That's misleading, as we spent $11,000 on engines alone. The big ones cost almost $1000.00 each. Many boats required only minor repairs. Some new ones went for 50,000 baht (roughly $1300.00) each. Several used boats and engines also topped 50,000. And 150,000 baht (almost $4,000) went to buy fishing nets. Our vision - to restore lives and livelihoods, went from abstract thought to physical reality. I'm proud of our joint venture and of everyone here and at home. I knew you were magnificent. Although we faced many tough challenges: cultural, linguistic, emotional, physical, and spiritual, we made it. It's been the hardest and most gratifying work of my life, second only to raising my family. Do you know the phrase: \"somebody\" should do something? Or the universal \"they\"? Well for one time in my life (so far), I and my little team were that \"somebody\" We were that \"they\". And we did something. I am painfully aware that in terms of the vast devastation across the region, our effort is small. But to the over 2000 people we touched, nothing about it was small. We made a difference. And please *** don't send any more money***, (unless someone would like to help me replace my \"lost\" camera. I really miss it. It was lost during the mission, by a friend as best I can discern, and not stolen). $167.17 remains in the boat fund. Unless someone objects, I'll donate it to Project Trang which is still helping people with food and water. So, please accept my humble gratitude and extend my thanks to everyone you know who prayed, wished, sent a donation, and helped in any way to make this all possible. A special thank you to the school children in Canada and Connecticut; bless you. Below are a few stories you may enjoy and one you won't. Selfless What a joy! I went early one morning to Klong Dao and there, already hard at work was Mr. Lee Sah, happily building his new little boat. A Muslim, he'd worked tirelessly for two months helping fix others boats. Finally toward the end, he let his secret out. His little boat had been destroyed, could Bill help? He had not said a word for two months. Same for Mr. Moot, another quiet Muslim helping the non Muslim Sea Gypsies. They simply asked for wood - they'd do their own labor. They both built new boats, small ones, exactly what they wanted.

They both built new boats, small ones, exactly what they wanted. We bought them new engines too. Broken Promise Restored Then there's Mr. Virat and Mr. Somchai. Neither man appeared on our lists for aid. Others had promised money for brand new boats, so they didn't ask us. They ordered new boats. Well, 'others' broke their promise; no money. Neither came directly to me. These were two of the quietest men I met. I don't think I ever heard them say a word. A village headman intervened. I almost didn't help. This was towards the end and by this time I'd had my fill of changing numbers. I'd told the headmen, 'Okay, you tell me exactly who still needs boats, motors, longtails, whatever - today. After today, nothing changes!' Fortunately, they knew my heart better than I did. After a little fussing and complaining on my part, I agreed. I'm so glad too. It was a good choice. They're good men. By the way, they got new engines too. No Debt Mr. Somkit and Mr. Sompoon of Klong Kong didn't ask either. They searched for and bought, on credit, bruised and battered second hand things, almost wrecks themselves. They never told me. The headman spoke up for them. I saw what they bought, once again realizing how important our mission was. These proud men were doing, not waiting. Your money paid the creditors and restored these vessels to sea worthy condition. They're back at sea today thanks to you. And neither is in debt. The stories go on and on. Some heartfelt, some made me want to quit. I'll give you one of those for balance. The \"Friend\" Most of the broken ones were fixed or being fixed. So I spread the word. It's time to start buying boats. The next day Faa called. Her friend found some boats in Krabi, about 1 - 2 hours away. Off we went, me, a headman, Faa, the \"friend\" who found them and a driver. Strangely, we stopped at a gas station, supposedly for the toilet, but picked up one more man. I neither speak Thai nor understand the culture yet, and depend on others to an extraordinary degree. But I do have intuition. When we picked up this man, something felt wrong. During price negotiations Faa tried to work on my behalf. The \"friend\" and the other fellow told her to shut up.

To Faa helping was more important than how they treated her. Had I known, I'd have bought nothing. I'll spare the details of the 9 hour adventure except to say there were so many boats we asked the fishermen to bring them all for viewing on March 6th. They agreed. On the way back Faa pretended to sleep in the van. She figured the rascals would expose their plan if they thought she was asleep and knew I didn't understand them. She was right. Our two opportunists revealed they had demanded the fishermen up their prices so each of them could take a fat commission and planned to come back on March 4th to do the same with every fisherman bringing a boat for sale. I sat in the van wary, but completely ignorant of the conversation going on around me. Much later, as we waited for the ferry, all the others got out for a smoke. In hushed tones, Faa quickly recounted her tale and told me details. I saw her deep anger, shame and fear. She and her husband fed this out of work \"friend\" every day at their table. She was very afraid. There's a lot I don't know about Thailand. She explained her idea for March 6th was to stop me from buying any more boats today. She knew I was getting cheated but couldn't say anything out loud. I'm deeply grateful for her courage, loyalty and ingenuity. I'd promised to buy two boats that day and even paid a deposit, so I kept my word. One Ko Lanta and one Ko Por fisherman have used boats. But the price, oh my, the price, and I'm not talking about money. It still hurts as I write this. My dear friend Dave Dewey, our Webmaster, said I changed that day. He's right. My dad said I should have expected that. I didn't, and it hurt deeply. We didn't go back March 6th. Eventually we went back, unannounced, but it didn't work out. We didn't buy any more boats there. That's okay. The Fisherwoman & the Reluctant Angel I dealt with fisher-men. That is until I met Ms Yan Butmeen, a middle aged woman.

I didn't ask; it's impolite here. I suspect she's a widow. She didn't ask for much, just what she needed. She also searched far and wide and discovered a little boat many islands away. We drove over an hour, and then rode a longtail to two islands before reaching her boat. The owner didn't want to sell. But from the laughter and bits of English I gathered the peer pressure from the village was too hot to handle. He reluctantly, but with a good nature, sold it along with a small engine. Being low tide, we actually had to pick it up and carry it hundreds of yards to the sea. It's amazing how people just appeared from nowhere to carry it. It was quite a joy to see her and Mai riding across the bay toward her new start in life. Stories abound; a boatload full, pardon the pun. These few give you a glimpse into both the deeply humble, hard working Sea Gypsies whom I love, and the dark side too. If you'd like more, let me know. I'm happy to relate them. Thank you for sharing this adventure with me, the team, and the people of Ko Lanta and Ko Por.

It wasn't. ** -- *Guardian*, 4/14/05 ** (in article that disappeared from website of one of the UK's leading newspapers) April 28, 2005 Dear friends, When I learn that the government has ordered the removal of an article from a major media website, I pay attention. **On April 15th, the *Guardian*, Britain's most respected liberal newspaper, published an article revealing that a major ricin ring claimed by Colin Powell as evidence of a major biological terror weapons threat, in fact never existed.** The revealing article originally published at [http://politics.guardian.co.uk/attacks/comment/0,1320,1459178,00.html](http://politics.guardian.co.uk/attacks/comment/0,1320,1459178,00.htm) has now been removed. According to [an article](http://www.globalresearch.ca/articles/PRO504A.html) on Prof. Michel Chossudovsky's excellent [Center for Research on Globalization](http://www.globalresearch.ca) website and other sources, the British government ordered the article removed from the website. Our governments are becoming ever bolder in preventing news from coming out which demonstrates that the war on terror is largely a fabrication. **Yet we now have large amounts of reliable, verifiable information exposing a concerted campaign by certain factions of government to induce fear in the public in order to promote their own hidden agendas.** The best single piece I've seen in this regard is the highly revealing BBC documentary *The Power of Nightmares*. To view this excellent documentary (and full transcript) online, [click here](https://www.WantToKnow.info/powerofnightmares). General Butler's riveting [War is a Racket](https://www.WantToKnow.info/warcoverup) provides further confirmation.

But yesterday a London jury brought down another section of the case he made for war - that Iraq and Osama bin Laden were supporting and directing terrorist poison cells throughout Europe, including a London ricin ring.** **Yesterday's verdicts on five defendants and the dropping of charges against four others make clear there was no ricin ring. Nor did the \"ricin ring\" make or have ricin. Not that the government shared that news with us. Until today, the public record for the past three fear-inducing years has been that ricin was found in the Wood Green flat occupied by some of yesterday's acquitted defendants. It wasn't. ** **The third plank of the al-Qaida-Iraq poison theory was the link between what Powell labelled the \"UK poison cell\" and training camps in Afghanistan.** The evidence the government wanted to use to connect the defendants to Afghanistan and al-Qaida was never put to the jury. That was because last autumn a trial within a trial was secretly taking place. **This was a private contest between a group of scientists from the Porton Down military research centre and myself. The issue was: where had the information on poisons and chemicals come from?** The information - five pages in Arabic, containing amateur instructions for making ricin, cyanide and botulinum, and a list of chemicals used in explosives - was at the heart of the case. The notes had been made by Kamel Bourgass, the sole convicted defendant. His co-defendants believed that he had copied the information from the internet. The prosecution claimed it had come from Afghanistan. I was asked to look for the original source on the internet. This meant exploring Islamist websites that publish Bin Laden and his sympathisers, and plumbing the most prolific source of information on how to do harm: the writings of the American survivalist right and the gun lobby. The experience of being an expert witness on these issues has made me feel a great deal safer on the streets of London.** These were the internal documents of the supposed al-Qaida cell planning the \"big one\" in Britain. But the recipes were untested and unoriginal, borrowed from US sources. Moreover, ricin is not a weapon of mass destruction. It is a poison which has only ever been used for one-on-one killings and attempted killings.** If this was the measure of the destructive", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:050428ricinringarticle.txt:1:7c603285f294", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 7325, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "050428ricinringarticle.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "050428ricinringarticle", "chunk_index": 2, "text": "being an expert witness on these issues has made me feel a great deal safer on the streets of London.** These were the internal documents of the supposed al-Qaida cell planning the \"big one\" in Britain.

It is a poison which has only ever been used for one-on-one killings and attempted killings.** If this was the measure of the destructive wrath that Bin Laden's followers were about to wreak on London, it was impotent. Yet it was the discovery of a copy of Bourgass's notes in Thetford in 2002 that inspired the wave of horror stories and government announcements and preparations for poison gas attacks. It is true that when the team from Porton Down entered the Wood Green flat in January 2003, their field equipment registered the presence of ricin. But these were high sensitivity field detectors, for use where a false negative result could be fatal. A few days later in the lab, Dr Martin Pearce, head of the Biological Weapons Identification Group, found that there was no ricin. But when this result was passed to London, the message reportedly said the opposite. The planned government case on links to Afghanistan was based only on papers that a freelance journalist working for the Times had scooped up after the US invasion of Kabul. Some were in Arabic, some in Russian. They were far more detailed than Bourgass's notes. Nevertheless, claimed Porton Down chemistry chief Dr Chris Timperley, they showed a \"common origin and progression\" in the methods, thus linking the London group of north Africans to Afghanistan and Bin Laden. The weakness of Timperley's case was that neither he nor the intelligence services had examined any other documents that could have been the source. We were told Porton Down and its intelligence advisers had never previously heard of the \"Mujahideen Poisons Handbook, containing recipes for ricin and much more\". The document, written by veterans of the 1980s Afghan war, has been on the net since 1998. **All the information roads led west, not to Kabul but to California and the US midwest. The recipes for ricin now seen on the internet were invented 20 years ago by survivalist Kurt Saxon.** He advertises videos and books on the internet. Before the ricin ring trial started, I phoned him in Arizona. For $ 110, he sent me a fistful of CDs and videos on how to make bombs, missiles, booby traps - and ricin. We handed a copy of the ricin video to the police. **When, in October, I showed that the chemical lists found in London were an exact copy of pages on an internet site in Palo Alto, California, the prosecution gave up on the Kabul and al-Qaida link claims.

It was given to the FBI to produce in the 2001 New York trial for the first attack on the World Trade Centre. But it wasn't an al-Qaida manual. The name was invented by the US department of justice in 2001, and the contents were rushed on to the net to aid a presentation to the Senate by the then attorney general, John Ashcroft, supporting the US Patriot Act. **To show that the Jihad manual was written in the 1980s and the period of the US-supported war against the Soviet occupation was easy. The ricin recipe it contained was a direct translation from a 1988 US book called the Poisoner's Handbook, by Maxwell Hutchkinson.** **We have all been victims of this mass deception.** I do not doubt that Bourgass would have contemplated causing harm if he was competent to do so. But he was an Islamist yobbo on his own, not an Al Qaida-trained superterrorist. An Asbo might be appropriate.

He has authored or edited over [two dozen scholarly books](http://www.amazon.com/David-Ray-Griffin/e/B000APTCK4/ref=sr_tc_2_0?qid=1412231139&sr=1-2-ent). First appearing in the national media May 7, 2004 on C-SPAN 2, his program was repeated a week later due to popular demand. In this 80-minute lecture to a standing room audience of 400 at the University of Wisconsin, Prof. David Ray Griffin, one of the most respected theologians in the US, discusses his extensive research into the 9/11 cover-up. ([View now](#now)) Links to an excellent *Washington Post* article and other resources on Prof. Griffin and his revealing work are also included below. Prof. Griffin was initially very skeptical of claims of a major cover-up around 9/11. But in April of 2003, a trusted friend sent him an email referring him to the reliable, easily verifiable information on the [two-page 9/11 summary](https://www.WantToKnow.info/911/9-11-timeline) from our website, [WantToKnow.info](https://www.WantToKnow.info). After exploring the links to revealing articles on major media websites and progressing eventually to our [60-page 9/11 timeline](https://www.WantToKnow.info/9-11timeline60pg) and other excellent resources, he became convinced of a major cover-up around 9/11. **Putting aside all of his work in theology, Prof. Griffin then devoted himself to writing [*The New Pearl Harbor*](http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_ss_i_0_9?url=search-alias%3Dstripbooks&field-keywords=new%20pearl%20harbor&sprefix=new+pearl%2Cstripbooks%2C595) (2004), a devastating book with detailed footnotes which systematically presents a powerful account questioning the official story of 9/11. ** Following the publication of the government's *9/11 Commission Report*, Prof. Griffin published a second highly compelling book, [***The 9/11 Commission Report: Omissions and Distortions***](http://www.amazon.com/11-Commission-Report-Omissions-Distortions/dp/1566565847/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1412231346&sr=1-1&keywords=9%2F11+omissions+and+distortions) (2005), which convincingly deconstructs the official story presented in the report. He shows, among many other things, that the Commission's executive director was strongly biased in support of the secrecy desired by the White House. Two more important books followed in 2006, *[**Christian Faith and the Truth Behind 9/11**](http://www.amazon.com/Christian-Faith-Truth-Behind-Reflection/dp/0664231179/ref=sr_1_4/105-8440910-6384446?tag=wanttinfo-20&ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1192825138&sr=1-4)* and *[**9/11 and American Empire: Intellectuals Speak Out**](http://www.amazon.com/11-American-Empire-Intellectuals-Speak/dp/1566566592/ref=sr_1_2/105-8440910-6384446?tag=wanttinfo-20&ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1192825138&sr=1-2)* (co-edited with [Peter Dale Scott](https://www.wanttoknow.info/aboutus#Scott)). In 2007 Prof. Griffin published his most remarkable book on 9/11, *[**Debunking 9/11 Debunking**](http://amazon.com/Debunking-11-Mechanics-Defenders-Conspiracy/dp/156656686X/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1/002-6608814-8156848?tag=wanttinfo-20&ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1174101902&sr=1-1)*, a detailed response to the well-funded official and semi-official attempts to debunk the 9/11 Truth movement. His next book, [***9/11 Contradictions: An Open Letter to Congress and the Press***](http://www.amazon.com/11-CONTRADICTIONS-Letter-Congress-Press/dp/1566567165/ref=sr_1_1?tag=wanttinfo-20&ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1204734032&sr=1-1), published in March, 2008, focuses on serious internal contradictions within the official story. On the seventh anniversary of the attacks, September 11, 2008, Prof. Griffin published a companion volume to *The New Pearl Harbor*, entitled [***The New Pearl Harbor Revisited***](http://www.amazon.com/New-Pearl-Harbor-Revisited-Cover-Up/dp/1566567297/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1?tag=wanttinfo-20&ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1221592389&sr=1-1), which updates and comments on each chapter from the earlier book.

On the seventh anniversary of the attacks, September 11, 2008, Prof. Griffin published a companion volume to *The New Pearl Harbor*, entitled [***The New Pearl Harbor Revisited***](http://www.amazon.com/New-Pearl-Harbor-Revisited-Cover-Up/dp/1566567297/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1?tag=wanttinfo-20&ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1221592389&sr=1-1), which updates and comments on each chapter from the earlier book. It includes in more accessible form all the most important findings from his intervening books on 9/11, as well as much entirely new information. The two volumes together provide the most up-to-date and comprehensive statement of the 9/11 truth movement's case against the official conspiracy theory. In May 2009, Griffin published [***Osama bin Laden: Dead or Alive?***](http://www.amazon.com/Osama-Bin-Laden-Dead-Alive/dp/1566567831/ref=pd_bxgy_b_img_b?tag=wanttinfo-20), in which he examines all the evidence suggesting either that OBL is still alive or is in fact dead. He concludes that bin Laden is almost certainly dead, probably since December, 2001, and that the series of audio and video \"messages\" from him are fakes, part of an eight-year-long US military and intelligence psyop directed at the American public. On the occasion of the eighth anniversary of the 9/11 attacks in September, 2009, Griffin published *[**The Mysterious Collapse of World Trade Center 7: Why the Final Official Report About 9/11 Is Unscientific and False**](http://www.amazon.com/Mysterious-Collapse-World-Trade-Center/dp/1566567866/ref=pd_ys_qtk_fr_t?tag=wanttinfo-20&pf_rd_p=236215901&pf_rd_s=center-5&pf_rd_t=1501&pf_rd_i=home&pf_rd_m=ATVPDKIKX0DER&pf_rd_r=1ZN5MBB2JEGFR7CG5FT5)*, a searing indictment of the National Institute of Standards and Technology's \"Final Report\" on the collapse of World Trade Center 7. In this crucially important book Griffin demonstrates that NIST, a federal scientific agency, resorted to scientific fraud of many different types to construct its defense of the official account. In September 2010, Griffin published the book [***Cognitive Infiltration: An Obama Appointee's Plan to Undermine the 9/11 Conspiracy Theory***](http://www.amazon.com/Cognitive-Infiltration-Appointees-Undermine-Conspiracy/dp/1566568218/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1283633910&sr=1-1). The book is the only fully adequate response to the essay \"Conspiracy Theories: Causes and Cures,\" written by Cass Sunstein, administrator of the White House Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, in which Sunstein issued a call for a Cointelpro-like program of government infiltration of 9/11 truth groups. Griffin shows that Sunstein's arguments are fundamentally flawed and self-contradictory, as well as legally questionable. On September 2, 2011, Prof. Griffin published his tenth book on the 9/11 attacks, [***9/11 Ten Years Later: When State Crimes Against Democracy Succeed***](http://www.amazon.com/11-Ten-Years-Later-Democracy/dp/1566568684/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1315845265&sr=1-1), to commemorate the 10th anniversary of the 9/11 attacks. In this powerful book he takes stock of what we know, after the passage of a decade of intensive grassroots research and analysis, about what really happened that day, and of the present state of the 9/11 truth movement - its strengths and its weaknesses, and how it can move forward most effectively. In April, 2012 a conference was held in Claremont, California honoring Prof. Griffin's amazing career, at which WantToKnow's Tod Fletcher presented a detailed summary and appraisal of his contributions to the 9/11 truth movement, especially his ten books on the subject.

Madison's public access cable television station, WYOU-TV/Channel 4, meanwhile, will air the talk at 7 p.m. Thursday. Americans interpret the events of Sept. 11 in one of four ways, Griffin said: A first group accepts the official interpretation that Sept. 11 was a surprise attack by Islamic terrorists. It is easy for these people \"to think of America's so-called War on Terror as a just war,\" Griffin said. A second group accepts the official line but thinks Sept. 11 has been used opportunistically by the Bush administration to extend the American empire. People who hold this view often believe that America's response to Sept. 11, which has led to hundreds of thousands of deaths, is far worse than the attacks themselves, he said. A third group believes the Bush administration knew the attacks were coming and let them happen. It shows the government as \"deliberate and cold-blooded,\" advancing its imperial designs while hypocritically portraying itself as promoting a \"culture of life,\" Griffin said. Although there has been no national survey, a [Zogby poll](https://www.WantToKnow.info/zogby911) taken last year indicated that almost half of the residents of New York City share this view, he said. A fourth group believes that the government orchestrated the attacks. While no poll shows how many Americans believe this, polls in Canada and Germany have found as many as 20 percent of those populations do, Griffin said. In his follow-up book, \"The 9/11 Commission Report: Omissions and Distortions,\" Griffin examines the questions that he and others in the \"9/11 Truth Movement\" charge were never examined by the federal government's 9/11 Commission. **Evidence to support the theory that U.S. officials had at least had some foreknowledge of the attacks comes from [David Schippers](https://www.WantToKnow.info/9-11timeline60pg#schippers), the chief prosecutor for the impeachment of President Bill Clinton, who reportedly received warnings from FBI agents about the attacks six weeks earlier, Griffin said.** Other government officials, including Attorney General John Ashcroft, would not respond to the warnings, he added.

There were also a suspiciously high number of put options for Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, which occupied 22 stories of the World Trade Center. \"U.S. intelligence agencies monitor the market, partly to look for signs of impending attacks,\" Griffin said. \"One wonders how information could be much more specific than this.\" Griffin then made a case that government officials planned and executed the attacks. **For one, the United States military neglected to send fighter jets to intercept the hijacked planes. Such [interceptions](https://www.WantToKnow.info/9-11timeline60pg#scramble) usually occur within 10 to 20 minutes after the first signs of trouble and are routine, happening about 100 times a year, Griffin said.** **It seems implausible, he said, that the [Pentagon](https://www.WantToKnow.info/9-11timeline60pg#pentagon) was struck by Flight 77, since it is \"surely the best defended building on the planet.\" The U.S. military has the best radar systems in the world and \"does not miss anything occurring in North American airspace,\" he added.** Griffin also made a case that the [collapse of the World Trade Center buildings](https://www.WantToKnow.info/9-11timeline60pg#wtcinvestigation) was brought on by thousands of explosives placed throughout each of the buildings. They went straight down, at free-fall speed, as in controlled demolitions, and many people in the buildings reported that they heard or felt explosions, he added. \"High-rise steel-frame buildings have never - before or after 9/11- been caused to [collapse by fire](https://www.WantToKnow.info/9-11timeline60pg#wtcinvestigation3),\" he said. Sue Adams, 50, introduced herself to Griffin after the talk, calling him heroic. \"I think some day we may really know the truth,\" she said, adding that it will likely be after the Bush administration is gone. Orion Litzau, a UW freshman studying engineering, agrees that the answers the government put out through the 9/11 Commission were more than a simple deception. \"They were not only partly false but a complete, bold face lie,\" he said. \"David Ray Griffin brings out interesting points about what could be the true story behind the 9/11 attack.\" **Jim Goulding, 67, who teaches religious studies at Edgewood College, admitted at first he wondered whether Griffin was a crackpot, but instead found he had a \"tremendous reputation as a theologian.\"** **Goulding has read both of Griffin's Sept. 11 books.** **\"I think he makes a convincing case - well documented, well footnoted,\" he said.** E-mail: skalk@madison.com Published: 9:36 AM 4/19/05 **Note:** On Wisconsin Pubic Radio (2/7/05) 27-year-CIA veteran [Ray McGovern](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ray_McGovern) said", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:050504davidraygriffin.txt:4:0fb6034d7ebb", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 7332, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "050504davidraygriffin.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "050504davidraygriffin", "chunk_index": 5, "text": "could be the true story behind the 9/11 attack.\" **Jim Goulding, 67, who teaches religious studies at Edgewood College, admitted at first he wondered whether Griffin was a crackpot, but instead found he had a \"tremendous reputation as a theologian.\"** **Goulding has read both of Griffin's Sept. 11 books.** **\"I think he makes a convincing case - well documented, well footnoted,\" he said.** E-mail: skalk@madison.com Published: 9:36 AM 4/19/05 **Note:** On Wisconsin Pubic Radio (2/7/05) 27-year-CIA veteran [Ray McGovern](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ray_McGovern) said he \"used to be an agnostic\" on the issue of official complicity in 9/11, but that Dr. David Ray Griffin's new book *The 9/11 Commission Report: Omissions and Distortions* has made a believer of him.

He embodied the American dream. Yet in the revealing article below, Turner explains why that dream is all but unattainable now due to ever greater media conglomeration. Independent entrepreneurs like himself can no longer survive, as the FCC has become almost a mouthpiece of the major media conglomerates. He calls on us all to join in calling for freedom and independence in the media.

Ted Turner warns that this is a dangerous development for the public, for democracy-even for capitalism itself.** In the late 1960s, when Turner Communications was a business of billboards and radio stations and I was spending much of my energy racing boats, a UHF-TV station came up for sale in Atlanta. It was losing $50,000 U.S. a month and its programmes were viewed by fewer than 5 percent of the market. So I acquired it. When I moved to buy a second station in Charlotte-this one worse than the first-my accountant quit in protest, and the company's board vetoed the deal. So I mortgaged my house and bought it myself. **The Atlanta purchase turned into a Superstation; the Charlotte purchase-when I sold it 10 years later-gave me the", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:050506mediaconglomerationfcc.txt:0:ef8b17e4382f", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 7334, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "050506mediaconglomerationfcc.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "050506mediaconglomerationfcc", "chunk_index": 1, "text": "sale in Atlanta.

So I mortgaged my house and bought it myself. **The Atlanta purchase turned into a Superstation; the Charlotte purchase-when I sold it 10 years later-gave me the capital to launch CNN. Both purchases played a role in revolutionizing television. And neither could happen today. ** **In the current climate of consolidation in the media industry, independent broadcasters simply don't survive for long.** That's why we haven't seen a new generation of people like me or even Rupert Murdoch-independent television upstarts who challenge the big boys and force the whole industry to compete and change. It's not that there aren't entrepreneurs eager to make their names and fortunes in broadcasting if given the chance. If nothing else, the 1990s dot-com boom showed that the spirit of entrepreneurship is alive and well in the world today, with plenty of investors willing to put real money into new media ventures. **The difference is that the U.S. government has changed the rules of the game.** When I was getting into the television business, lawmakers and the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) took seriously the commission's mandate to promote diversity, localism, and competition in the media marketplace. They wanted to make sure that the big, established networks-CBS, ABC, NBC-wouldn't forever dominate what the American public could watch on TV. They wanted independent television producers to thrive. They wanted more people to be able to own TV stations. They believed in the value of competition. When the FCC had received a glut of applications for new television stations after World War II, the agency set aside dozens of channels on the new UHF spectrum so independents could get a foothold in television. That helped me get my start 35 years ago. But that was then. **Today, media companies are more concentrated than at any time over the past 40 years, thanks to a continual loosening of ownership rules by the FCC.** Media giants now own not only broadcast networks and local stations; they also own the cable companies and the studios that produce most of the programming. To get a flavour of how consolidated the industry has become, consider this: **In 1990, the major broadcast networks-ABC, CBS, NBC, and Fox-fully or partially owned just 12.5 percent of the new television series they aired; the rest were from independent producers. By 2000, it was 56.3 percent. Just two years later, it had surged to 77.5 percent.** In this environment, most independent media firms either get gobbled up by one of the big companies or driven out of business altogether. **Yet instead of balancing the rules", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:050506mediaconglomerationfcc.txt:1:4a3dafff26a6", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 7335, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "050506mediaconglomerationfcc.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "050506mediaconglomerationfcc", "chunk_index": 2, "text": "the industry has become, consider this: **In 1990, the major broadcast networks-ABC, CBS, NBC, and Fox-fully or partially owned just 12.5 percent of the new television series they aired; the rest were from independent producers.

Just two years later, it had surged to 77.5 percent.** In this environment, most independent media firms either get gobbled up by one of the big companies or driven out of business altogether. **Yet instead of balancing the rules to give independent broadcasters a fair chance in the market, Washington continues to tilt the playing field to favour the biggest players. ** In the media, as in any industry, big corporations play a vital role, but so do small, emerging ones. **When you lose small businesses, you lose big ideas. People who own their own businesses are independent thinkers. They know they can't compete by imitating the big guys-they have to innovate.** They are quicker to seize on new technologies and new product ideas. They steal market share from the big companies, spurring them to adopt new approaches. This process promotes competition, which leads to higher quality, more jobs and greater wealth. It's called capitalism. **But without the proper rules, healthy capitalist markets turn into sluggish oligopolies-and that is what's happening in media today. Large corporations are more profit-focused and risk-averse than ever before**. The moguls behind the mergers are acting in their corporate interests and playing by the rules. We just shouldn't accept those rules. They make sense for a corporation. But for a society, it's like over-fishing the oceans. **When the independent businesses are gone, where will the new ideas come from?** We have to do more than keep media giants from growing larger; they're already too big. We need a new set of rules that will break these huge companies into smaller ones. Throughout the 1990s, media mergers were celebrated in the press and otherwise ignored by the American public. So, it was easy to assume that media consolidation was neither controversial nor problematic. But then a funny thing happened. **In the summer of 2003, the FCC proposed changes favouring even more consolidation-raising the national audience-reach cap from 35 percent to 45 percent**; allowing corporations to own a newspaper and a TV station in the same market; and permitting corporations to own three TV stations in the largest markets, up from two, and two stations in medium-sized markets, up from one. **Unexpectedly, the public rebelled.** Hundreds of thousands of citizens complained to the FCC. Groups ranging from the National Organization for Women to the National Rifle Association demanded that Congress reverse the ruling. And lawmakers finally took action, pushing the national audience cap back down to 35, until-under strong White House pressure-it was revised back up to 39 percent. Last June, the U.S. Court of Appeals threw out the rules that would have allowed corporations to", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:050506mediaconglomerationfcc.txt:2:3e54dce96e28", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 7336, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "050506mediaconglomerationfcc.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "050506mediaconglomerationfcc", "chunk_index": 3, "text": "medium-sized markets, up from one. **Unexpectedly, the public rebelled.** Hundreds of thousands of citizens complained to the FCC.

Last June, the U.S. Court of Appeals threw out the rules that would have allowed corporations to own more television and radio stations in a single market. **The FCC defends its actions by saying that we have more media choices than ever before. But only a few corporations decide what we can choose. That is not choice**.** That's like a dictator deciding what candidates are allowed to stand for parliamentary elections, and then claiming that the people choose their leaders. The loss of independent operators hurts both the media business and its citizen-customers. When they disappear, the emphasis in the media shifts from taking risks to raking in profits. When that happens, quality suffers, local culture suffers and democracy itself suffers.** Top managers in these huge media conglomerates run their companies for the short term. Media mega-mergers inevitably lead to an overemphasis on short-term earnings. You can see this overemphasis in the spread of reality television. Shows like Fear Factor cost little to produce-there are no actors to pay and no sets to maintain-and they get big ratings. Thus, American television has moved away from expensive sitcoms and on to cheap thrills. We've gone from Father Knows Best to Who Wants to Marry My Dad?, and from My Three Sons to My Big Fat Obnoxious Fiancé. **Consolidation also means a decline in the local focus of both news and programming.** After analyzing 23,000 stories on 172 news programmes over five years, the [Project for Excellence in Journalism](http://www.journalism.org/) found that big media news organizations relied more on syndicated feeds and were more likely to air national stories with no local connection than smaller ones. That's not surprising. Local coverage is expensive, and will usually be sacrificed in the quest for short-term earnings. **Loss of local content also undercuts the public-service mission of the media, and this can have dangerous consequences.** In early 2002, when a freight train derailed near Minot, N.D., releasing a cloud of anhydrous ammonia over the town, police tried to call local radio stations, six of which are owned by radio mammoth Clear Channel Communications. According to news reports, it took over an hour to reach anyone at the stations to put an alert on the air. No one was answering the phone because the programming for all six stations was being beamed from Clear Channel headquarters in San Antonio, Texas-some 1,600 miles away. By the next day, 300 people had been hospitalized, many partially blinded by the ammonia. Pets and livestock died.

By the next day, 300 people had been hospitalized, many partially blinded by the ammonia. Pets and livestock died. Consolidation has given big media companies new power over what is said not just on the air, but off it as well. Cumulus Media banned the band Dixie Chicks on its 42 country music stations for 30 days after lead singer Natalie Maines criticized President Bush for the war in Iraq. It's hard to imagine Cumulus would have been so bold if its listeners had more of a choice in country music stations. And Disney recently provoked an uproar when it prevented its subsidiary Miramax from distributing Michael Moore's film Fahrenheit 9/11. As a senior Disney executive told The New York Times: \"It's not in the interest of any major corporation to be dragged into a highly charged partisan political battle.\" Follow the logic, and you can see what lies ahead: **if the only media companies are major corporations, controversial and dissenting views may not be aired at all.** **This is a fight about freedom-the freedom of independent entrepreneurs to start and run a media business, and the freedom of citizens to get news, information, and entertainment from a wide variety of sources, at least some of which are truly independent and not run by people making decisions based on quarterly earnings reports. **No one should underestimate the danger. Big media companies want to eliminate all ownership limits. With the removal of these limits, immense media power will pass into the hands of a very few corporations and individuals. What will programming be like when it's produced for no other purpose than profit? What will news be like when there are no independent news organizations to go after stories the big corporations avoid? Who really wants to find out? Safeguarding the welfare of the public cannot be the first concern of a large publicly traded media company. Its job is to seek profits. But if the government writes the rules in a way that encourages entry into the market of entrepreneurs-men and women with big dreams, new ideas, and a willingness to take long-term risks-the economy will be stronger, and the country will be better off. Media companies have grown so large and powerful, and their dominance has become so detrimental to the survival of small, emerging companies, that there remains only one alternative: bust up the big conglomerates. We've done this before: to the railroad monopolies in the first part of the twentieth century, to phone companies more recently. **Breaking up", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:050506mediaconglomerationfcc.txt:4:2adbdb8f62e6", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 7338, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "050506mediaconglomerationfcc.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "050506mediaconglomerationfcc", "chunk_index": 5, "text": "women with big dreams, new ideas, and a willingness to take long-term risks-the economy will be stronger, and the country will be better off.

So where are these countries and al Qaeda getting funding for developing and implementing this sophisticated kind of attack? For comparison, CNN notes that one B-2 stealth bomber costs [$2.2 billion](http://www.cnn.com/US/9903/24/us.kosovo.military/). And though the US [budget for intelligence is classified](http://seattlepi.nwsource.com/national/196473_intel23.html), the Congressional Budget Office website states that for \"new intelligence-related activities\" alone, [$20 billion](http://www.cbo.gov/ftpdocs/35xx/doc3592/hr5005.pdf) was allocated in 2004, while the [US defense budget](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/politics/interactives/budget06/budget06Agencies.html) is well over $400 billion. **Do these \"rogue states\" and terrorist organizations have the budget and sophistication to produce a devastating electromagnetic attack which could disable the entire United States?** Remember that most of us have never ever heard of an EMP attack. When we consider the abundant evidence of complicity in the [9/11 cover-up](https://www.WantToKnow.info/9-11cover-up), **could it be that rogue elements within the shadow government are the ones actually planning a sophisticated electromagnetic attack to then blame on others in order to manipulate the public into supporting a war?** There are certainly precedents for this.

And it is probably the easiest. A single Scud missile, carrying a single nuclear weapon, detonated at the appropriate altitude, would interact with the Earth's atmosphere, producing an electromagnetic pulse radiating down to the surface at the speed of light. Depending on the location and size of the blast, the effect would be to knock out already stressed power grids and other electrical systems across much or even all of the continental United States, for months if not years.** Few if any people would die right away. But the loss of power would have a cascading effect on all aspects of U.S. society. Communication would be largely impossible. Lack of refrigeration would leave food rotting in warehouses, exacerbated by a lack of transportation as those vehicles still working simply ran out of gas (which is pumped with electricity). The inability to sanitize and distribute water would quickly threaten public health, not to mention the safety of anyone in the path of the inevitable fires, which would rage unchecked. And as we have seen in areas of natural and other disasters, such circumstances often result in a fairly rapid breakdown of social order. **American society has grown so dependent on computer and other electrical systems that we have created our own Achilles' heel of vulnerability, ironically much greater than those of other, less developed nations.**", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:050509electromagneticattack.txt:1:b00d2728642c", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 7341, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "050509electromagneticattack.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "050509electromagneticattack", "chunk_index": 2, "text": "water would quickly threaten public health, not to mention the safety of anyone in the path of the inevitable fires, which would rage unchecked. And as we have seen in areas of natural and other disasters, such circumstances often result in a fairly rapid breakdown of social order. **American society has grown so dependent on computer and other electrical systems that we have created our own Achilles' heel of vulnerability, ironically much greater than those of other, less developed nations.** When deprived of power, we are in many ways helpless, as the New York City blackout made clear. In that case, power was restored quickly because adjacent areas could provide help. But a large-scale burnout caused by a broad EMP attack would create a much more difficult situation. Not only would there be nobody nearby to help, it could take years to replace destroyed equipment. Transformers for regional substations, for example, are massive pieces of equipment that are no longer manufactured in the United States and typically take more than a year to build. In the words of another witness at the hearing, \"The longer the basic outage, the more problematic and uncertain the recovery of any [infrastructure system] will be. It is possible -- indeed, seemingly likely -- for sufficiently severe functional outages to become mutually reinforcing, until a point at which the degradation . . . could have irreversible effects on the country's ability to support any large fraction of its present human population.\" Those who survived, he said, would find themselves transported back to the United States of the 1880s. This threat may sound straight out of Hollywood, but it is very real. CIA Director Porter Goss recently testified before Congress about nuclear material missing from storage sites in Russia that may have found its way into terrorist hands, and FBI Director Robert Mueller has confirmed new intelligence that suggests al Qaeda is trying to acquire and use weapons of mass destruction. Iran has surprised intelligence analysts by describing the mid-flight detonations of missiles fired from ships on the Caspian Sea as \"successful\" tests. North Korea exports missile technology around the world; Scuds can easily be purchased on the open market for about $100,000 apiece. A terrorist organization might have trouble putting a nuclear warhead \"on target\" with a Scud, but it would be much easier to simply launch and detonate in the atmosphere. No need for the risk and difficulty of trying to smuggle a nuclear weapon over the border or hit a particular city. Just launch a cheap missile from a freighter in international waters -- al Qaeda is believed to own about 80 such vessels -- and make sure to get it a few miles in the air. Fortunately, hardening key infrastructure systems and procuring vital backup equipment such as transformers is both feasible and -- compared with the threat -- relatively inexpensive, according", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:050509electromagneticattack.txt:2:6da57dfc3812", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 7342, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "050509electromagneticattack.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "050509electromagneticattack", "chunk_index": 3, "text": "the risk and difficulty of trying to smuggle a nuclear weapon over the border or hit a particular city.

Fortunately, hardening key infrastructure systems and procuring vital backup equipment such as transformers is both feasible and -- compared with the threat -- relatively inexpensive, according to a comprehensive report on the EMP threat by a commission of prominent experts. But it will take leadership by the Department of Homeland Security, the Defense Department, and other federal agencies, along with support from Congress, all of which have yet to materialize. The Sept. 11 commission report stated that our biggest failure was one of \"imagination.\" No one imagined that terrorists would do what they did on Sept. 11. Today few Americans can conceive of the possibility that terrorists could bring our society to its knees by destroying everything we rely on that runs on electricity.

Simon & Schuster. $24. At the start of the twisted treasure hunt that is ''The Men Who Stare at Goats,'' the journalist Jon Ronson appears to be looking for furtive, paranoid quacks who play mind games. He seems to have hit the mother lode. Take the goats of the title: Mr. Ronson cites a hundred of them. He says that they have been hidden at a Goat Lab at Fort Bragg in North Carolina and de-bleated for security reasons. They have been used in top-secret experiments by psychic spies whose existence is not officially acknowledged by the United States Army. Military psychics are so well hidden that they aren't covered by the Army's coffee budget. It makes them cranky to have to bring their own coffee to work. **''The damn psychic spies should be keeping their damn mouths shut, instead of chitchatting all over town about what they did.'' So says retired Maj. Gen. Albert N. Stubblebine III, the first of the many characters redolent of ''Dr. Strangelove'' who are found in this jaw-dropper of a -- hard to believe, but, yes -- nonfiction story.** **Some of these experts contend that a goat's heart can be stopped by the intense gaze of a certain kind of supersoldier. ''Goat didn't have a chance,'' one of these tough guys tells Mr. Ronson.** Such fighters sometimes refer to themselves as Jedi Warriors, because the thinking about their occult superpowers dates back to early ''Star Wars'' days. It was then that the post-Vietnam military, demoralized and fiscally hamstrung, was ready to try anything in the way of intangible new weaponry. Mr. Ronson sets his book up beautifully. It moves with wry, precise agility from crackpot to crackpot in its search for the essence of this early New Age creativity. Much of it can be traced to the 1977 fact-finding mission of Lt. Col. Jim Channon, now also retired but given credit for an influential legacy. It was Colonel Channon's 125-page ''First Earth Battalion Operations Manual'' that suggested a whole new approach to combat and a whole new type of military uniform. According to Colonel Channon's plan, soldiers' uniforms should include pouches for ginseng regulators, divining tools and loudspeakers that would emit ''indigenous music and words of peace.''

According to Colonel Channon's plan, soldiers' uniforms should include pouches for ginseng regulators, divining tools and loudspeakers that would emit ''indigenous music and words of peace.'' The author's explorations also take him to one soldier of fortune who died after ''acting too big for his boots regarding his superhuman powers,'' and to a New Age company alleged to be dealing in both healing bars (costing $7,600 and resembling blocks of soap) and group sex (''Don't tell your husband because he wouldn't understand the energy work''). Then there are the double agents supposedly operating within the flying saucer set. ''The U.F.O. community?'' the author asks one source. ''Why would government spies want to infiltrate that?'' ''Oh, Jon,'' the source tells him, delivering the kind of swift punch line that makes this book so entertaining. ''Don't be naïve.'' At this point, ''The Men Who Stare at Goats'' still concentrates on quirks, making it a smarter, nuttier version of ''The Tipping Point'' or ''Blink.'' But then it moves into a different realm. While Colonel Channon was asserting that the military should be ''unafraid to appear harebrained and half-baked in their pursuit of a new kind of weapon,'' a parallel and less theoretical set of experiments was unfolding. And Mr. Ronson addresses the more sinister aspect of out-of-the-box military thinking. ''The Men Who Stare at Goats'' turns into a book that connects dots. It sees a common thread in the use of screamingly bad music to assault Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega in Panama and the use of similar tactics in the destruction of the Branch Davidian compound in Waco, Tex. In these accounts, Mr. Ronson writes as much about schemes that were only contemplated as about the ones that actually made the cut. **For instance, he describes the effort to deploy a Moscow scientist who had previously sent subliminal messages to Red Army troops (''Do not get drunk before battle'') in the Branch Davidian standoff. This scientist didn't work out because he was unwilling to transmit words spoken by Charlton Heston as a bogus voice of God. ** Mr. Ronson, a filmmaker and journalist whose earlier book, ''Them: Adventures With Extremists,'' was also outstandingly artful and chilling, eventually follows his trail of bread crumbs to the realms that really matter. **He finds a prologue in MK-ULTRA, the real C.I.A. ''Manchurian Candidate'' research of the 1950's, which involved the disastrous use of LSD as a potential truth serum.** He follows this line of thinking through and beyond the fruitcake innovations of the 1970's, concluding that Colonel Channon's theories ''could be used to shatter people rather than heal", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:050513menwhostareatgoatsjonronson.txt:2:8007e1b43f4d", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 7347, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "050513menwhostareatgoatsjonronson.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "050513menwhostareatgoatsjonronson", "chunk_index": 3, "text": "book, ''Them: Adventures With Extremists,'' was also outstandingly artful and chilling, eventually follows his trail of bread crumbs to the realms that really matter. **He finds a prologue in MK-ULTRA, the real C.I.A.

''Those are the ideas that live on in the War on Terror,'' he adds. Inevitably, this account extends to the tactics of American guards at the Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq. **And somehow Mr. Ronson is able to keep his book both light and nightmarish.** (Asked if there was a single good thing to be said about the prison, one former guard says it was an address to which Amazon.com delivered.) Absurdity is never far away. Discussing the weird tricks played on prisoners in both Iraq and Cuba, he finds the English journalist Martin Bashir interviewing one former captive. Mr. Bashir asks whether the prisoner saw his now-notorious Michael Jackson documentary. ''Jamal replied, 'I've, uh, been in Guantánamo Bay for two years.''' **Mr. Ronson, who lives in London and exclaims the occasional ''bloody hell'' at these discoveries, remains terrifically adept at capturing the horror of these developments without losing track of their lunacy**. About propaganda dropped from airplanes: ''The Americans have always been better than the Iraqis at the leaflets.'' Early in the 1991 Persian Gulf war, he says, Iraqi psychological warfare meant telling American soldiers: ''Your wives are back at home having sex with Bart Simpson and Burt Reynolds.''

But people kept asking him about Iraq. And he had many photos, some of them extremely difficult to look at, that were permanent reminders of events that are likely to stay with him for a lifetime. There are pictures of children who were wounded and barely clinging to life, and some who appeared to be dead. **There was a close-up of a soldier who was holding someone's severed leg. There were photos of Iraqis with the deathlike stare of shock, stunned by the fact that something previously unimaginable had just happened to them. There were photos of G.I.'s happily posing with the bodies of dead Iraqis.** **This is what happens", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:050522warishell.txt:0:4d9e53a32c7a", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 7349, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "050522warishell.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "050522warishell", "chunk_index": 1, "text": "stay with him for a lifetime.

There were photos of G.I.'s happily posing with the bodies of dead Iraqis.** **This is what happens in war. It's the sickening reality that is seldom seen in the censored, sanitized version of the conflict that Americans typically get from the government and the media. ** Americans' attitude toward war in general and this war in particular would change drastically if the censor's veil were lifted and the public got a sustained, close look at the agonizing bloodshed and other horrors that continue unabated in Iraq. If that happened, support for any war that wasn't an absolute necessity would plummet. Mr. Delgado, 23, is a former Army reservist who was repelled by the violence and dehumanization of the war. He completed his tour in Iraq. But he sought and received conscientious objector status and was honorably discharged last January. **Some of the most disturbing photos in his possession were taken after G.I.'s at Abu Ghraib opened fire on detainees who had been throwing rocks at guards during a large protest. Four detainees were killed. The photos show American soldiers posing and goofing around with the bodies of the detainees.** **In one shot a body bag has been opened to show the gruesome head wound of the corpse. In another, a G.I. is leaning over the top of the body bag with a spoon in his right hand, as if he is about to scoop up a portion of the dead man's wounded flesh. ** **\"These pictures were circulated like trophies,\" Mr. Delgado said. ** **Some were posted in command headquarters.** He said it seemed to him that the shooting of the prisoners and the circulation of the photos were viewed by enlisted personnel and at least some officers as acceptable - even admirable - behavior. Mr. Delgado said that when his unit was first assigned to Abu Ghraib, he believed, like most of his fellow soldiers, that the prisoners were among the most dangerous individuals in Iraq. He said: \"Most of the guys thought, 'Well, they're out to kill us. These are the ones killing our buddies.' \" **But while at work in a headquarters office, he said, he learned that most of the detainees at Abu Ghraib had committed only very minor nonviolent offenses, or no offenses at all. (Several investigations would subsequently reveal that vast numbers of completely innocent Iraqis were seized and detained by coalition forces.)** Several months ago Mr. Delgado gave a talk and presented a slide show at his school, New College", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:050522warishell.txt:1:f0f57177b4ca", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 7350, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "050522warishell.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "050522warishell", "chunk_index": 2, "text": "to kill us.

To his amazement, 400 people showed up. He has given a number of talks since then in various parts of the country. **His goal, he said, is to convince his listeners that the abuse of innocent Iraqis by the American military is not limited to \"a few bad apples,\" as the military would like the public to believe. \"At what point,\" he asked, \"does a series of 'isolated incidents' become a pattern of intolerable behavior?\"** The public at large and especially the many soldiers who have behaved honorably in Iraq deserve an honest answer to that question. It took many long years for the military to repair its reputation after Vietnam. Mr. Delgado's complaints and the entire conduct of this wretched war should be thoroughly investigated. **See the exceptional collection of resources in our [Inspiration Center](https://www.WantToKnow.info/inspirational) ** **Kindly support this work: [Donate here](https://www.WantToKnow.info/donationswtk.php)** Explore the mind and heart expanding websites managed by the nonprofit PEERS network: [www.peerservice.org](https://www.peerservice.org) - PEERS websites: Spreading inspiration, education, & empowerment [www.momentoflove.org](https://www.momentoflove.org) - Every person in the world has a heart [www.personalgrowthcourses.net](https://www.personalgrowthcourses.net) - Dynamic online courses powerfully expand your horizons [www.WantToKnow.info](https://www.WantToKnow.info) - Reliable, verifiable information on major cover-ups [www.weboflove.org](https://www.weboflove.org) - Strengthening the Web of Love that interconnects us all [Subscribe/Unsubscribe/Change email address](https://www.WantToKnow.info/subscribe): The WantToKnow.info email list (two messages a week) War is Hell", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:050522warishell.txt:2:470687e7f7e2", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 7351, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "050525opportunity911.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "050525opportunity911", "chunk_index": 0, "text": "9/11 Opportunity **Important 9/11 Opportunity and Improvements to WantToKnow.info** May 25, 2005 Dear friends, **We have a wonderful opportunity to break the 9/11 story even further into the mainstream media.** We've already had some amazing breakthroughs on 9/11 media coverage lately, including Dr. David Ray Griffin's powerful [9/11 lecture](https://www.WantToKnow.info/050504davidraygriffin) being featured two weekends in a row on nationally televised C-SPAN. I'll be sending out an email soon detailing the many recent articles and shows which have appeared in the media questioning the official 9/11 story. We've also seen a few key media pieces debunking the 9/11 cover-up, which demonstrate that those behind the cover-up are beginning to feel the issue can no longer be ignored. We now have a major opportunity to take 9/11 media coverage a step further. A freelance reporter with contacts at New York's *Newsday*, one of the 10 largest circulation newspapers in the US, contacted Dr. Griffin, who referred him to me and others. I talked extensively with this gentleman on the phone yesterday. **This reporter informed me that he and his colleagues have received information that a significant number of agents in the FBI, CIA, and other intelligence services are talking about the complicity of rogue elements within the US government in the 9/11 attacks.** He is pulling together information to write an article about officials within government who do not believe the government's official story. **I am making a special request right now to any of you who know of government officials who, either on the record or off the record, are willing to talk about their doubt of the official story of 9/11.** Please encourage them to contact me so that I can give them information on how they can be involved in this important news story. And to those of you on this list who are government officials, please contact me if you would be willing to consider this. Even if you are not willing to have your name mentioned in the news, this reporter is very interested in your input. This article could really open some doors. **I have not received a single threat since my own crucial [whistleblowing testimony](https://www.WantToKnow.info/050228secretmeeting) in Indonesia** as a former presidential interpreter. These are exciting times we live in, and here is an opportunity for you to join me and many others in courageously standing up and making a difference! I also am in contact with a number of government insiders who I will be sending personal invitations about this. As one powerful example, an incredibly knowledgeable Navy veteran who worked 24 years in deep cover intelligence told me over the phone about being called three times by a retired CIA friend in the 24 hours preceding the 9/11 attacks. **In the final call, just hours before the first plane hit, his intelligence friend warned that they were expecting a major terrorist attack that day on", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:050525opportunity911.txt:0:b4f19dc9308c", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 7352, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "050525opportunity911.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "050525opportunity911", "chunk_index": 1, "text": "a number of government insiders who I will be sending personal invitations about this.

Ten new patients were admitted and Nurse Susan spent the morning and afternoon checking them in. Her friend Sharron, an aide, prepared ten rooms for the patients and made sure they were comfortable. After they were finished she grabbed Sharron and said, \"We deserve a break. Let's go eat.\" Sitting across from each other in the noisy cafeteria, Susan noticed Sharron absently wiping the moisture off the outside of her glass with her thumbs. Her face reflected a weariness that came from more than just a busy day. \"You're pretty quiet. Are you tired, or is something wrong?\" Susan asked. Sharron hesitated. However, seeing the sincere concern in her friend's face, she confessed, \"I can't do this the rest of my life, Susan. I have to find a higher-paying job to provide for my family. We barely get by. If it weren't for my parents keeping my kids, well, we wouldn't make it.\" **Susan noticed the bruises on Sharron's wrists peeking out from under her jacket.** \"What about your husband?\" \"We can't count on him. He can't seem to hold a job. He's got . . . problems.\" \"Sharron, you're so good with patients, and you love working here. Why don't you go to school and become a nurse? There's financial help available, and I'm sure your parents would agree to keep the kids while you are in class.\" \"It's too late for me, Susan; I'm too old for school. I've always wanted to be a nurse, that's why I took this job as an aide; at least I get to care for patients.\" \"How old are you?\" Susan asked. \"Let's just say I'm thirty-something.\" **Susan pointed at the bruises on Sharron's wrists. \"I'm familiar with 'problems' like these.

Honey, it's never too late to become what you've dreamed of. Let me tell you how I know.\"** Susan began sharing a part of her life few knew about. It was something she normally didn't talk about, only when it helped someone else. \"I first married when I was thirteen years old and in the eighth grade.\" Sharron gasped. \"My husband was twenty-two. I had no idea he was violently abusive. We were married six years and I had three sons. One night my husband beat me so savagely he knocked out all my front teeth. I grabbed the boys and left. \"At the divorce settlement, the judge gave our sons to my husband because I was only nineteen and he felt I couldn't provide for them. The shock of him taking my babies left me gasping for air. To make things worse, my ex took the boys and moved, cutting all contact I had with them. \"Just like the judge predicted, I struggled to make ends meet. I found work as a waitress, working for tips only. Many days my meals consisted of milk and crackers. The most difficult thing was the emptiness in my soul. I lived in a tiny one-room apartment and the loneliness would overwhelm me. I longed to play with my babies and hear them laugh.\" **She paused. Even after four decades, the memory was still painful. Sharron's eyes filled with tears as she reached out to comfort Susan. Now it didn't matter if the bruises showed.** Susan continued, \"I soon discovered that waitresses with grim faces didn't get tips, so I hid behind a smiling mask and pressed on. I remarried and had a daughter. She became my reason for living, until she went to college. Then I was back where I started, not knowing what to do with myself - until the day my mother had surgery. I watched the nurses care for her and thought: I can do that. The problem was, I only had an eighth-grade education. Going back to high school seemed like a huge mountain to conquer. I decided to take small steps toward my goal. The first step was to get my GED. My daughter used to laugh at how our roles reversed. Now I was burning the midnight oil and asking her questions.\" **Susan paused and looked directly in Sharron's eyes. \"I received my diploma when I was forty-six years old.\"** Tears streamed down Sharron's cheeks.

But my family wouldn't let me. I remember calling my daughter and yelling, 'Do you realize how many bones are in the human body, and I have to know them all! I can't do this, I'm forty-six years old!' But I did. Sharron, I can't tell you how wonderful it felt when I received my cap and pin.\" Sharron's lunch was cold, and the ice had melted in her tea by the time Susan finished talking. Reaching across the table and taking Sharron's hands, Susan said, \"You don't have to put up with abuse. Don't be a victim - take charge. You will be an excellent nurse. We will climb this mountain together.\" **Sharron wiped her mascara-stained face with her napkin. \"I had no idea you suffered so much pain. You seem like someone who has always had it together.\"** \"I guess I've developed an appreciation for the hardships of my life,\" Susan answered. \"If I use them to help others, then I really haven't lost a thing. Sharron, promise me that you will go to school and become a nurse. Then help others by sharing your experiences. Sharron promised. In a few years she became a registered nurse and worked alongside her friend until Susan retired. Sharron never forgot her colleague or the rest of her promise. Now Sharron sits across the table taking the hands of those who are bruised in body and soul, telling them, \"It's never too late.

I am most thankful to the *New York Times* for running this highly revealing article. I've included key excerpts below, and provided the link for those who want to read the entire article. Below the *New York Times* article are excerpts from another revealing article in the *Los Angeles Times* on CEO pay increases, with link provided. **\"The average CEO made 42 times the average worker's pay in 1980. That increased to 85 times in 1990 and is now over 300 times.\"** Neither of these articles mention the rapidly growing gap between the developed and the developing nations of the world. Do you think most CEOs care how much you earn? Do you care how much those in developing countries earn? **It is clear to me that greed and lack of concern for the global human family are two main forces behind the major cover-ups explored on WantToKnow.info.** Let us examine where greed causes us to place our own interests above those around us.

Scott Fitzgerald pronounced that the very rich \"are different from you and me,\" Ernest Hemingway's famously dismissive response was: \"Yes, they have more money.\" Today he might well add: much, much, much more money. **The people at the top of America's money pyramid have so prospered in recent years that they have pulled far ahead of the rest of the population, an analysis of tax records and other government data by *The New York Times* shows. They have even left behind people making hundreds of thousands of dollars a year. ** Call them the hyper-rich. They are not just a few Croesus-like rarities.

They have even left behind people making hundreds of thousands of dollars a year. ** Call them the hyper-rich. They are not just a few Croesus-like rarities. Draw a line under the top 0.1 percent of income earners - the top one-thousandth. Above that line are about 145,000 taxpayers, each with at least $1.6 million in income and often much more. **The average income for the top 0.1 percent was $3 million in 2002, the latest year for which averages are available. That number is two and a half times the $1.2 million, adjusted for inflation, that group reported in 1980. No other income group rose nearly as fast. ****The share of the nation's income earned by those in this uppermost category has more than doubled since 1980, to 7.4 percent in 2002. The share of income earned by the rest of the top 10 percent rose far less, and the share earned by the bottom 90 percent fell. ** Next, examine the net worth of American households. The group with homes, investments and other assets worth more than $10 million comprised 338,400 households in 2001, the last year for which data are available. The number has grown more than 400 percent since 1980, after adjusting for inflation, while the total number of households has grown only 27 percent. The Bush administration tax cuts stand to widen the gap between the hyper-rich and the rest of America. The merely rich, making hundreds of thousands of dollars a year, will shoulder a disproportionate share of the tax burden. **President Bush said during the third election debate last October that most of the tax cuts went to low- and middle-income Americans. In fact, most - 53 percent - will go to people with incomes in the top 10 percent over the first 15 years of the cuts, which began in 2001 and would have to be reauthorized in 2010. And more than 15 percent will go just to the top 0.1 percent, those 145,000 taxpayers. ** The Times set out to create a financial portrait of the very richest Americans, how their incomes have changed over the decades and how the tax cuts will affect them.** It is no secret that the gap between the rich and the poor has grown, but the extent to which the richest are leaving everyone else behind is not widely known. ** The analysis also found the following: **¶Under the Bush tax cuts, the 400 taxpayers with the highest incomes - a minimum of $87 million in 2000, the last year for which the government will release", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:050608richgetricher.txt:1:6748844545d4", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 7361, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "050608richgetricher.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "050608richgetricher", "chunk_index": 2, "text": "have changed over the decades and how the tax cuts will affect them.** It is no secret that the gap between the rich and the poor has grown, but the extent to which the richest are leaving everyone else behind is not widely known. ** The analysis also found the following: **¶Under the Bush tax cuts, the 400 taxpayers with the highest incomes - a minimum of $87 million in 2000, the last year for which the government will release such data - now pay income, Medicare and Social Security taxes amounting to virtually the same percentage of their incomes as people making $50,000 to $75,000.** ¶Those earning more than $10 million a year now pay a lesser share of their income in these taxes than those making $100,000 to $200,000. ¶The alternative minimum tax, created 36 years ago to make sure the very richest paid taxes, takes back a growing share of the tax cuts over time from the majority of families earning $75,000 to $1 million - thousands and even tens of thousands of dollars annually. Far fewer of the very wealthiest will be affected by this tax. **The analysis examined only income reported on tax returns. The Treasury Department says that the very wealthiest find ways, legal and illegal, to shelter a lot of income from taxes. So the gap between the very richest and everyone else is almost certainly much larger. ** One way to understand the growing gap is to compare earnings increases over time by the vast majority of taxpayers - say, everyone in the lower 90 percent - with those at the top, say, in the uppermost 0.01 percent (now about 14,000 households, each with $5.5 million or more in income last year). **From 1950 to 1970, for example, for every additional dollar earned by the bottom 90 percent, those in the top 0.01 percent earned an additional $162, according to the Times analysis. From 1990 to 2002, for every extra dollar earned by those in the bottom 90 percent, each taxpayer at the top brought in an extra $18,000.** The Bush administration says that the tax cuts have actually made the income tax system more progressive, shifting the burden slightly more to those with higher incomes. Still, **an Internal Revenue Service study found that the only taxpayers whose share of taxes declined in 2001 and 2002 were those in the top 0.1 percent. ** \"In this income data I see a snapshot of a very innovative society,\" said Tim Kane, an economist at the Heritage Foundation. \"Lower taxes and lower marginal tax rates are leading to more growth.

Buffett, George Soros and Ted Turner, have warned that such a concentration of wealth can turn a meritocracy into an aristocracy and ultimately stifle economic growth by putting too much of the nation's capital in the hands of inheritors rather than strivers and innovators. Speaking of the increasing concentration of incomes, Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, warned in Congressional testimony a year ago: \"For the democratic society, that is not a very desirable thing to allow it to happen.\" ** *Los Angeles Times* - [http://www.latimes.com/business/careers/work/la-fi-execpay31may31,1,7406992.story](http://www.latimes.com/business/careers/work/la-fi-execpay31may31,1,7406992.story) ** Gulf Between Top, Bottom Gets Wider** **A Times survey of the state's largest companies shows that CEOs' pay is growing at a much faster pace than that of rank-and-file employees.** By Kathy M. Kristof, Times Staff Writer Everyone knows that the top dog makes a lot more than the rest of the pack. But the big pay hikes awarded to chief executives are leaving the pack even further behind each year, The Times' annual executive compensation survey shows. **CEOs at California's largest 100 public companies took home a collective $1.1 billion in 2004, up almost 20% from 2003. That compares with the 2.9% raise that the average California worker saw last year, according to the Economic Policy Institute in Washington.** The difference is even sharper at the top rungs of the ladder. The 10 highest-paid executives on this year's list earned 36.7% more than last year's top 10 - garnering a collective $467.5 million. That's enough to buy about 275 homes in Malibu or 1.5 million sets of golf clubs or two 747 jumbo jets. Although limited to California companies, the survey reflects a national trend: a widening chasm between the pay of chief executives and rank-and-file employees. **\"The average CEO made 42 times the average worker's pay in 1980. That increased to 85 times in 1990 and is now over 300 times,\"** said Brandon Rees, a research analyst with the AFL-CIO's office of investment, a group that tracks, and is critical of, executive pay policies. \"That is clearly not a sustainable rate of growth.\" Sometimes, executive pay soars even in bad years. Sanmina-SCI Corp., a San Jose telecommunications company with $12 billion in sales, lost money in 2003 and 2004. Yet Chief Executive Jure Sola scored a 1,500% hike in total pay during 2004, according to The Times survey. Sola was paid $19.8 million last year, while the company lost $14.9 million. **Note:** For another excellent, in-depth article from the *New York Times* on the increased gap between the super-rich and", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:050608richgetricher.txt:3:ed52d5b127b8", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 7363, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "050608richgetricher.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "050608richgetricher", "chunk_index": 4, "text": "rate of growth.\" Sometimes, executive pay soars even in bad years.

Both sides praying for protection, yet someone always gets hurt. Someone dies. Someone cries so deep they lose their watery state. Angels must be confused by war. Who can they help? Who can they clarify? Whose mercy do they cast to the merciless? No modest scream can be heard. No stainless pain can be felt. All is clear to angels except in war. When I awoke to this truth, it was from a dream I had last night. I saw two angels conversing in a field of children's spirits rising like silver smoke. The angels were fighting among themselves about which side was right, and which was wrong. Who started the conflict? Suddenly, the angels stilled themselves like a stalled pendulum, and they shed their compassion to the rising smoke of souls who bore the watermark of war. They turned to me with those eyes from God's library, and all the pieces fallen were raised in unison, intertwined like the breath of flames in a holy furnace.

And now, when I think of war, I flick these threads to all the universe, hoping they stick on others as they did me. Knitting angels and animals to the filamental grace of compassion.

Meanwhile, the job of scientists, engineers and impartial researchers everywhere is to get the scientific and engineering analysis of 9/11 right.\" **However, Reynolds said \"getting it right in today's security state' remains challenging because he claims explosives and structural experts have been intimidated in their analyses of the collapses of 9/11.** From the beginning, the Bush administration claimed that burning jet fuel caused the collapse of the towers. Although many independent investigators have disagreed, they have been hard pressed to disprove the government theory since most of the evidence was removed by FEMA prior to independent investigation. Critics claim the Bush administration has tried to cover-up the evidence and the recent 9/11 Commission has failed to address the major evidence contradicting the official version of 9/11. Some facts demonstrating the flaws in the government jet fuel theory include: -- Photos showing people walking around in the hole in the North Tower where 10,000 gallons of jet fuel supposedly was burning.. --When the South Tower was hit, most of the North Tower's flames had already vanished, burning for only 16 minutes, making it relatively easy to contain and control without a total collapse. --The fire did not grow over time, probably because it quickly ran out of fuel and was suffocating, indicating without added explosive devices the fires could have been easily controlled. --**FDNY fire fighters still remain under a tight government gag order to not discuss the explosions they heard, felt and saw. FAA personnel are also under a similar 9/11 gag order. ** --Even the flawed 9/11 Commission Report acknowledges that \"none of the [fire] chiefs present believed that a total collapse of either tower was possible.\" -- Fire had never before caused steel-frame buildings to collapse except for the three buildings on 9/11, nor has fire collapsed any steel high rise since 9/11. -- The fires, especially in the South Tower and WTC-7, were relatively small. -- **WTC-7 was unharmed by an airplane and had only minor fires on the seventh and twelfth floors of this 47-story steel building yet it collapsed in [less than 10 seconds](http://www.whatreallyhappened.com/wtc7.html).** -- WTC-5 and WTC-6 had raging fires but did not collapse despite much thinner steel beams. -- **In a PBS documentary, Larry Silverstein, the WTC leaseholder, told the fire department commander on 9/11", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:050620officialstory911bogus.txt:2:12d60c0358eb", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 7372, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "050620officialstory911bogus.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "050620officialstory911bogus", "chunk_index": 3, "text": "rise since 9/11. -- The fires, especially in the South Tower and WTC-7, were relatively small. -- **WTC-7 was unharmed by an airplane and had only minor fires on the seventh and twelfth floors of this 47-story steel building yet it collapsed in [less than 10 seconds](http://www.whatreallyhappened.com/wtc7.html).** -- WTC-5 and WTC-6 had raging fires but did not collapse despite much thinner steel beams. -- **In a PBS documentary, Larry Silverstein, the WTC leaseholder, told the fire department commander on 9/11 about WTC-7 that \"[may be the smartest thing to do is pull it](http://www.whatreallyhappened.com/PULLIT.mp3),\" slang for demolish it.** -- It's difficult if not impossible for hydrocarbon fires like those fed by jet fuel (kerosene) to raise the temperature of steel close to melting. Despite the numerous holes in the government story, the Bush administration has brushed aside or basically ignored any and all critics. Mainstream experts, speaking for the administration, offer a theory essentially arguing that an airplane impact weakened each structure and an intense fire thermally weakened structural components, causing buckling failures while allowing the upper floors to pancake onto the floors below. One who supports the official account is Thomas Eager, professor of materials engineering and engineering systems at MIT. He argues that the collapse occurred by the extreme heat from the fires, causing the loss of loading-bearing capacity on the structural frame. Eagar points out the steel in the towers could have collapsed only if heated to the point where it \"lost 80 percent of its strength,\" or around 1,300 degrees Fahrenheit. Critics claim his theory is flawed since the fires did not appear to be intense and widespread enough to reach such high temperatures. Other experts supporting the official story claim the impact of the airplanes, not the heat, weakened the entire structural system of the towers, but critics contend the beams on floors 94-98 did not appear severely weakened, much less the entire structural system. Further complicating the matter, hard evidence to fully substantiate either theory since evidence is lacking due to FEMA's quick removal of the structural steel before it could be analyzed. Even though the criminal code requires that crime scene evidence be kept for forensic analysis, FEMA had it destroyed or shipped overseas before a serious investigation could take place. And even more doubt is cast over why FEMA acted so swiftly since coincidentally officials had arrived the day before the 9/11 attacks at New York's Pier 29 to conduct a war game exercise, named \"Tripod II.\" Besides FEMA's quick removal of the debris, authorities considered the steel quite valuable as New York City officials had every debris truck tracked on GPS and even fired one truck driver who took an unauthorized lunch break. **In a detailed analysis just released supporting the controlled demolition theory, Reynolds presents a compelling case. ** \"First, no steel-framed skyscraper, even engulfed in flames hour after hour, had", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:050620officialstory911bogus.txt:3:40f3b7409d47", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 7373, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "050620officialstory911bogus.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "050620officialstory911bogus", "chunk_index": 4, "text": "at New York's Pier 29 to conduct a war game exercise, named \"Tripod II.\" Besides FEMA's quick removal of the debris, authorities considered the steel quite valuable as New York City officials had every debris truck tracked on GPS and even fired one truck driver who took an unauthorized lunch break. **In a detailed analysis just released supporting the controlled demolition theory, Reynolds presents a compelling case. ** \"First, no steel-framed skyscraper, even engulfed in flames hour after hour, had ever collapsed before. Suddenly, three stunning collapses occur within a few city blocks on the same day, two allegedly hit by aircraft, the third not,\" said Reynolds. \"These extraordinary collapses after short-duration minor fires made it all the more important to preserve the evidence, mostly steel girders, to study what had happened. **\"On fire intensity, consider this benchmark: A 1991 FEMA report on Philadelphia's Meridian Plaza fire said that the fire was so energetic that 'beams and girders sagged and twisted, but despite this extraordinary exposure, the columns continued to support their loads without obvious damage.' Such an intense fire with consequent sagging and twisting steel beams bears no resemblance to what we observed at the WTC.\"** After considering both sides of the 9/11 debate and after thoroughly sifting through all the available material, Reynolds concludes the government story regarding all four plane crashes on 9/11 remains highly suspect. **\"In fact, the government has failed to produce significant wreckage from any of the four alleged airliners that fateful day. The familiar photo of the Flight 93 crash site in Pennsylvania shows no fuselage, engine or anything recognizable as a plane, just a smoking hole in the ground,\" said Reynolds. \"Photographers reportedly were not allowed near the hole. Neither the FBI nor the National Transportation Safety Board have investigated or produced any report on the alleged airliner crashes.\"** For more informative articles, go to [www.arcticbeacon.com](http://www.arcticbeacon.com).

After the 1989 announcement of fusion in a bottle, so to speak, and the subsequent retraction, the whole idea of cold fusion seemed a bit beyond the pale. But that's all about to change. **A very reputable, very careful group of scientists at the University of Los Angeles (Brian Naranjo, Jim Gimzewski, Seth Putterman) has initiated a fusion reaction using a laboratory device that's not much bigger than a breadbox, and works at roughly room temperature. This time, it looks like the real thing.** Before going into their specific experiment, it's probably a good idea to define exactly what nuclear fusion is, and why we're so interested in understanding the process.

This time, it looks like the real thing.** Before going into their specific experiment, it's probably a good idea to define exactly what nuclear fusion is, and why we're so interested in understanding the process. This also gives me an excuse to talk about how things work deep inside the nuclei of atoms, a topic near and dear to most astronomers (more on that later). Simply put, nuclear fusion means ramming protons and neutrons together so hard that they stick, and form a single, larger nucleus. When this happens with small nuclei (like hydrogen, which has only one proton or helium, which has two), you get a lot of energy out of the reaction. This specific reaction, fusing two hydrogen nuclei together to get helium, famously powers our sun (good), as well as hydrogen bombs (bad). **Fusion is a tremendous source of energy; the reason we're not using it to meet our everyday energy needs is that it's very hard to get a fusion reaction going. The reason is simple: protons don't want to get close to other protons.** Do you remember learning about electricity in high school? I sure do - I dreaded it whenever that topic came around. I had a series of well-meaning science teachers that thought it would be fun for everyone to hold hands and feel a mild electric shock pass their arms. Every time my fists clenched and jerked and I had nothing consciously do with it, my stomach turned. In addition, I have long, fine hair, and was often made a victim of the Van de Graf generator - the little metal ball with a rubber belt inside it that creates enough static electricity to make your hair stand on end. Yeesh. Anyway, hopefully you remember the lesson that two objects having different electrical charges (positive and negative) attract one another, while those with the same charge repel. It's a basic law of electricity, and it definitely holds true when two protons try to get close together. Protons have positive charges, and they repel each other. Somehow, in order for fusion to work, you've got to overcome this repulsive electrical force and get the things to stick together. Here's where an amazing and mysterious force comes in that, although we don't think about it in our day-to-day lives, literally holds our matter together. **There are four universal forces of nature, two of which you're probably familiar with: gravity and electromagnetism.** **But there are two other forces that really only come in to play inside atomic nuclei: the strong and weak nuclear forces** (and yes, the strong force is the stronger of the two, the weak is weaker.

Scientists really have a way with names, don't they?) I'm going to focus on the strong force, as that's the one responsible for nuclear fusion. The strong force is an attractive force between protons and neutrons - it wants to stick them together. If the strong force had its way, the entire universe would be one big super-dense ball of protons and neutrons, one big atomic nucleus, in fact. **Fortunately, the strong force only becomes strong at very small scales: about one millionth billionth of a meter. Yes, that's 0.000000000000001 meters. Any farther away, and the strong force loses its grip. But if you can get protons and neutrons that close together, the strong force becomes stronger than any other force in nature, including electricity.** That's important- all protons have the same charge, so they'd like to fly away from each other. But if you can get them close together, inside the volume of an atomic nucleus, the strong force will bind them together. **The whole trick with fusion is you've got to get protons close enough together for the strong force to overcome their electrical repulsion and merge them together into a nucleus. The sun does this pretty much by brute force.** The sun has over 300,000 times the mass of the Earth, which means there's a lot of gravity weighing down on its core. That pressure gets the sun's internal temperature up to several millions of degrees, which means that particles inside the sun's core are flying around at huge velocities. Everything is moving around so fast that protons sometimes get slammed together before their charges have a chance to repel. The strong force takes hold, and a new atom (helium) is born. In this process, some of the mass of the protons is converted into energy, powering the sun and producing the light that will eventually reach the Earth as sunlight. Scientists have gotten fusion to occur in the laboratory before, but for the most part, they've tried to mimic conditions inside the sun by whipping hydrogen gas up to extreme temperatures or slamming atoms together in particle accelerators. Both of those options require huge energies and gigantic equipment, not the sort of stuff easily available to build a generator. Is there any way of getting protons close enough together for fusion to occur that doesn't require the energy output of a large city to make it happen? The answer, it turns out, is yes. **Instead of", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:050623coldfusioncrystals.txt:2:6f2e8ad35d4b", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 7377, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "050623coldfusioncrystals.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "050623coldfusioncrystals", "chunk_index": 3, "text": "tried to mimic conditions inside the sun by whipping hydrogen gas up to extreme temperatures or slamming atoms together in particle accelerators.

Is there any way of getting protons close enough together for fusion to occur that doesn't require the energy output of a large city to make it happen? The answer, it turns out, is yes. **Instead of using high temperatures and incredible densities to ram protons together, the scientists at UCLA cleverly used the structure of an unusual crystal.** **Crystals are fascinating things; the atoms inside are all lined up in a tightly ordered lattice, which creates the beautiful structure we associate with crystals. Sometimes those orderly atoms create neat side-effects, like piezoelectricity, which is the effect of creating an electrical charge in a crystal by compressing it. Stressing the bonds between the atoms of some crystals causes electrons to build up on one side, creating a charge difference over the body of the crystal. Other crystals do this when you heat or cool them; these are called pyroelectric crystals.** The new cold fusion experiment went something like this: scientists inserted a small pyroelectric crystal (lithium tantalite) inside a chamber filled with hydrogen. Warming the crystal by about 100 degrees (from -30 F to 45F) produced a huge electrical field of about 100,000 volts across the small crystal. The tip of a metal wire was inserted near the crystal, which concentrated the charge to a single, powerful point. Remember, hydrogen nuclei have a positive charge, so they feel the force of an electric field, and this one packed quite a wallop! The huge electric field sent the nuclei careening away, smacking into other hydrogen nuclei on their way out. **Instead of using intense heat or pressure to get nuclei close enough together to fuse, this new experiment used a very powerful electric field to slam atoms together.** Unlike some previous claims of room-temperature fusion, this one makes intuitive sense: its just another way to get atoms close enough together for the strong force to take over and do the rest. Once the reaction got going, the scientists observed not only the production of helium nuclei, but other tell-tale signs of fusion such as free neutrons and high energy radiation. **This experiment has been repeated successfully and other scientists have reviewed the results: it looks like the real thing this time.** **For the time being, don't expect fusion to become a readily available energy option. The current cold fusion apparatus still takes much more energy to start up than you get back out, and it may never end up breaking even. In the mean time, the crystal-fusion device might be used as a compact source of neutrons and X-rays, something that could turn out to be useful making", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:050623coldfusioncrystals.txt:3:41773a696571", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 7378, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "050623coldfusioncrystals.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "050623coldfusioncrystals", "chunk_index": 4, "text": "scientists have reviewed the results: it looks like the real thing this time.** **For the time being, don't expect fusion to become a readily available energy option.

Project MKULTRA (or MK-ULTRA) is the most infamous of these, yet thanks to a virtual media blackout on the subject, very few people are aware of any of these disturbing programs. In a rare article in the *Washington Post* (see below), a few of the many disturbing aspects of Project MKULTRA are discussed. **The article is an obituary for John K. Vance, a member of the CIA inspector general's staff in the early 1960s who discovered that the CIA was secretly conducting illegal mind control activities in Project MKULTRA.** **Thanks to the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), government documents dealing with Project MKULTRA and other secret mind control programs are now available to the public.** In 1973, tipped off about forthcoming congressional investigations, CIA Director Richard Helms [ordered the destruction](https://www.WantToKnow.info/a-cia-mindcontrol-experiments) of all MKULTRA records.

Vance; Uncovered LSD Project at CIA** By Joe Holley Washington Post Staff Writer Thursday, June 16, 2005; Page B08 John K. Vance, 89, a member of the Central Intelligence Agency inspector general's staff in the early 1960s who discovered that the agency was running a research project that included administering LSD and other drugs to unwitting human subjects, died May 27 of respiratory arrest. He died at the Wilson Health Care Center of Asbury Methodist Village in Gaithersburg. **Code-named MKULTRA (and pronounced m-k-ultra), the project Mr. Vance uncovered was the brainchild of CIA Director Allen Dulles, who was intrigued by reports of mind-control techniques allegedly conducted by Soviet, Chinese and North Korean agents on U.S. prisoners of war during the Korean War. The CIA wanted to use similar techniques on its own POWs and perhaps use LSD or other mind-bending substances on foreign leaders, including Cuba's Fidel Castro a few years after the project got underway in 1953.** **Heading MKULTRA was a CIA chemist named [Sidney Gottlieb](https://www.WantToKnow.info/mindcontrolnewsarticles#article_1215).

It was terminated in the late 1960s. **MKULTRA came to public light in 1977 as a result of hearings conducted by a Senate committee on intelligence chaired by Sen. Frank Church (D-Idaho).** Mr. Vance gave several long phone interviews to committee staff members but never had to testify. Mr. Vance was born in Seward, Neb., and graduated magna cum laude from Doane College in Crete, Neb., in 1936. He received a master's degree in economics from Columbia University in 1937 and a bachelor's degree in library science from Columbia in 1939. He began working on his doctorate at Harvard University during World War II but soon was serving in the Army. He was sent to language school to learn German and worked as a military interpreter at the postwar Nuremberg trials. In Nuremberg, he met people in the intelligence world. His CIA career began in 1947. He was on the inspector's general's staff from 1960 to 1963, and then became the director of central reference until his retirement in 1971. A member of the Maryland Ornithological Society and the Maryland Nature Conservancy, Mr. Vance helped in bird banding and also enjoyed gardening, biking, tennis and travel. He was a member of the Cedar Lane Unitarian Church in Bethesda. Survivors include his wife of 64 years, Elizabeth E. Vance of Gaithersburg; three daughters, Sally Roman of Kensington, Julia Stewart of Columbus, Ohio, and Margie Kay of Timonium, Md.; eight grandchildren; and five great-grandsons. **Note: **The *Washington Post* website carries the above MKULTA article on [this webpage](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/06/15/AR2005061502685.html). **Important Note:** For other highly revealing major media articles and government documents on Project MKULTRA and other secret mind control programs, [click here](https://www.WantToKnow.info/mindcontrolnewsarticles).

Besides a one-mile daily run, once a week I go for a refreshing one-hour trek in the beautiful hills of a forested park not far from my home. I clearly remember back in elementary school reading the incredible story of determination of world-famous runner Glenn Cunningham. It inspired me to believe that anything is possible. **This amazing story of a boy who was supposed to die beautifully illustrates the incredible power of determination.** I deeply believe that we are [much more powerful](https://www.WantToKnow.info/g/fredburks/down_the_rabbit_hole) than we might ever imagine.

An eight-year-old boy named Glenn Cunningham had the job of coming to school early each day so that he could use kerosene to start the fire and warm the room before his teacher and his classmates arrived. One cold morning someone mistakenly filled the kerosene container he used with gasoline, and disaster struck. The class and teacher arrived to find the schoolhouse engulfed in flames. Terrified on realizing that Glenn was inside, they rushed in and managed to drag the unconscious little boy out of the flaming building more dead than alive. He had major burns over the lower half of his body and was taken to a nearby county hospital. From his bed, the dreadfully burned, semi-conscious little boy faintly heard the doctor talking to his mother. The doctor told his mother that her son would surely die - which was for the best, really - for the terrible fire had devastated the lower half of his body. But the brave boy didn't want to die. Glenn made up his mind that he would survive. And somehow, to the amazement of the physician, he did survive. Yet when the mortal danger was past, he again heard the doctor and his mother speaking quietly. **The mother was told that since the fire had destroyed so much flesh in the lower part of his body, it would almost be better if he had died, since he was doomed to be a lifetime cripple with no use at all of his lower limbs.** His mother refused to let the doctors amputate. Once more this brave little boy made up his mind. He would not be a cripple. He would walk. But unfortunately from the waist down, Glenn had no motor ability. His thin, scarred legs just dangled there, all but lifeless. Ultimately Glenn was released from the hospital.

His thin, scarred legs just dangled there, all but lifeless. Ultimately Glenn was released from the hospital. Every day afterward his mother and father would massage his little legs, but there was no feeling, no control, nothing. Yet his determination that he would walk was as strong as ever. When he wasn't in bed, he was confined to a wheelchair. One sunny day his mother wheeled him out into the yard to get some fresh air. This day, instead of sitting there, he threw himself from the chair. Glenn pulled himself across the grass, dragging his legs behind him. He worked his way to the white picket fence bordering their lot. With great effort, he raised himself up on the fence. **Then, stake by stake, he began dragging himself along the fence, resolved that he would walk.** He started to do this every day until he wore a smooth path all around the yard beside the fence. There was nothing he wanted more than to develop life in those legs. Ultimately through his daily massages, Glenn's iron persistence and his resolute determination, he did develop the ability first to stand up, then to walk haltingly with help, then to walk by himself - and then miraculously - to run. Glenn began to run to school. He ran for the sheer joy of running and being able to run. He ran everywhere that he could. The people in his town would often see him run by on his way to who knows where and smile. Later in college Glenn made the track team where his tremendous determination paid off. He eventually received the nickname the \"Kansas Flyer.\" **In February 1934, in New York City's famed Madison Square Garden, this young man who was not expected to survive, who would surely never walk, who could never hope to run - this determined young man, Dr. Glenn Cunningham, ran the mile in four minutes and eight seconds, the world's fastest indoor mile!** Later that same year in a prestigious outdoor track meet, he shaved another second off his record to run the world's fastest mile to that time. ** Note:** To verify this amazing true story, see the Glenn Cunningham article on the website of the Kansas Sports Hall of Fame at [this link](https://www.kshof.org/inductees/2-kansas-sports-hall-of-fame/inductees/102-cunningham-glenn.html).

I am incredibly thankful to the *Christian Science Monitor*, which, in the article below, spells out clearly just what happened, and why it happened. The war in Iraq almost certainly would not have happened if Bush administration had failed to convince the public that Saddam Hussein harbored dangerous weapons of mass destruction (WMDs). We now know that there were no WMDs. **Why aren't more reporters pointing out the fact that the CIA knew this before the war started; that Joseph Wilson clearly informed the administration of this; that the administration disregarded this vital information and lied to the public in order to promote their war agenda; and that most importantly, when Joseph Wilson exposed these lies, someone in the administration retaliated by revealing to the press that Wilson's wife was a CIA agent. ** **The loss of the lives of thousands of American soldiers and many more innocent Iraqi civilians could have been avoided if the administration had given heed to Wilson's information.** To learn more about how those in power have often lied to the public and manipulated us into supporting war, see our [War Information Center](https://www.WantToKnow.info/warinformation), and especially a highly revealing two-page essay by a former US general at [www.WantToKnow.info/warcoverup](https://www.WantToKnow.info/warcoverup) Please help to play the role at which our media is so sadly failing by sending this information on to your friends and colleagues.

Mr. Wilson spent eight days talking to everyone in Niger possibly involved and came back to report no sign of an Iraqi bid for uranium** and, anyway, Niger's uranium was committed to other countries for many years to come. No news is bad news for an administration gearing up for war.** Ignoring Wilson's report, Cheney talked on TV about Iraq's nuclear potential. And the president himself, in his 2003 State of the Union address no less, pronounced: \"The British government has learned that Saddam Hussein recently sought significant quantities of uranium from Africa.\"** **Wilson declined to maintain a discreet silence. He told various people that the president was at least mistaken, at most telling an untruth. Finally Wilson directly challenged the administration with a July 6, 2003 New York Times op-ed headlined, \"What I didn't find in Africa,\" and making clear his belief that the president deliberately manipulated intelligence in order to justify an invasion.** One can imagine the fury in the White House. We now know from the e-mail traffic of Time's correspondent Matt Cooper that five days after the op-ed appeared, he advised his bureau chief of a supersecret conversation with Karl Rove who alerted him to the fact that Wilson's wife worked for the CIA and may have recommended him for the Niger assignment. **Three days later, Bob Novak's column appeared giving Wilson's wife's name, Valerie Plame, and the fact she was an undercover CIA officer**. Mr. Novak has yet to say, in public, whether Mr. Rove was his source.** Enough is known to surmise that the leaks of Rove, or others deputized by him, amounted to retaliation against someone who had the temerity to challenge the president of the United States when he was striving to find some plausible reason for invading Iraq.** **The role of Rove and associates added up to a small incident in a very large scandal", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:050718karlrovevalerieplame.txt:1:45463ca607b3", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 7388, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "050718karlrovevalerieplame.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "050718karlrovevalerieplame", "chunk_index": 2, "text": "was an undercover CIA officer**.

And that - when it comes to the human body - the heart is much more important than the brain to overall health and well-being - even cognitive function - than anyone but poets believed. Its dominance inside the body is now clearly demonstrated. Thinking clearly with your brain is useful. But feeling positively from your heart provides an amazing boost to health and creativity. Briefly re-experiencing a cherished memory creates synchronization in your heart rhythm in mere seconds. This increases the release of healthy, energizing hormones, while at the same time decreasing levels of damaging stress hormones, at the same time your immune system is strengthened, blood pressure decreases ... and health and focus increase. **Using a simple prescription that consists of a number of exercises that anyone can do anywhere in a few minutes - the details are coming shortly - HeartMath is successfully battling the greatest threat to health, happiness and peace in this world: stress.** Stress is the plague of our time, an epidemic that is spreading rapidly. The World Health Organization (WHO) raised the alarm 20 years ago, but things have only gotten worse. Every day some one million Americans fail to come to work due to stress. The European Union estimated in 2000 that the annual price tag of stress, in the form of healthcare costs and lost productivity, amounts to some three to four percent of the EU's gross domestic product. Stress is one of the most important causes of high blood pressure, which afflicts one in three adults in Europe and North America and is the cause of many serious illnesses such as heart disease and stroke. Stress also lies at the basis of depression and burnout. \"**The good news is that the negative effects of stress can be effectively countered more easily than people might imagine.** This leads to better performance in every aspect of life. It is therefore a smart strategy for every organization to tackle this source of excessive costs and human strain,\" according to HeartMath's president and CEO Bruce Cryer. That insight has now permeated many companies and institutions. Managers are sent to stress seminars. Yoga lessons are offered at company headquarters. And there are even companies that encourage their employees to take vacations. But these measures aren't very effective as long as stress continues to permeate the corporate culture. The sense of relief from a yoga lesson or a weekend at the beach is often lost during the first chat with a frustrated colleague at the coffee machine.", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:050720heartmath.txt:1:8fc4517dd2f6", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 7391, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "050720heartmath.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "050720heartmath", "chunk_index": 2, "text": "Cryer.

The sense of relief from a yoga lesson or a weekend at the beach is often lost during the first chat with a frustrated colleague at the coffee machine. A successful anti-stress strategy provides results precisely at the moment the stress is experienced. This is what HeartMath does, which is why its client list now includes such leading companies as Hewlett Packard, Shell, Unilever, Cisco Systems, and Boeing. HeartMath was established in 1991 by Doc Lew Childre. Childre had made a name for himself as a researcher and advisor to companies and scientific institutions. With the founding of HeartMath, he embarked on his mission to demonstrate that the heart was central to human health, success and fulfillment. **While HeartMath's techniques emphasize the importance of emotional self-management, HeartMath is no new age phenomenon. It is a research institute that has published a large body of scientific research in established and respected publications such as the Harvard Business Review and the American Journal of Cardiology.** Those publications support HeartMath's central aim of presenting revolutionary scientific discoveries in a solid, \"bullet proof\" way. It has demonstrated significant cost savings for healthcare organizations struggling with staff turnover, and has shown significant health benefits in an array of studies covering congestive heart failure, diabetes, asthma, and hypertension. As Cryer says, \"HeartMath is not based simply on belief. There are proven physiological reactions in how emotion, heart and brain interact.\" In other words: HeartMath's work is kept scrupulously free of the obvious potential for opportunism. Which is admirable given that financing and survival issues have presented tricky challenges for the organization through the years. HeartMath's location reflects this cautious strategy. The institute is located in a group of buildings on a lovely retreat-like setting in Boulder Creek, a town that is nearly impossible to find among the tall trees of the ancient Californian forests. Stress and Boulder Creek have little to do with one another, I realize, following a drive through the pouring rain. And yet the decision to locate HeartMath here was not so odd. Forty-five minutes down the road is a well-known hotbed of this \"modern plague:\" Silicon Valley. Research director Rollin McCraty is in his office - a simple study with a huge window looking out over a wooded slope - working on one of HeartMath's latest initiatives: a computer-driven experiment that shows how the heart reacts more quickly to external stimuli than the brain.** HeartMath programs utilize an innovative biofeedback system - developed by founder Doc Childre - whereby your finger or ear is hooked up to a sensor that shows", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:050720heartmath.txt:2:4458f6df6bb8", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 7392, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "050720heartmath.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "050720heartmath", "chunk_index": 3, "text": "of this \"modern plague:\" Silicon Valley. Research director Rollin McCraty is in his office - a simple study with a huge window looking out over a wooded slope - working on one of HeartMath's latest initiatives: a computer-driven experiment that shows how the heart reacts more quickly to external stimuli than the brain.** HeartMath programs utilize an innovative biofeedback system - developed by founder Doc Childre - whereby your finger or ear is hooked up to a sensor that shows the heart's activity on a computer screen.** The feedback is not a precondition for the result of the HeartMath exercises, but seeing your heart rhythms live on a computer screen makes it easier to convince critics of the favourable effect of positive feelings. Measuring internal feelings using modern instruments is not new in itself. For example, with the help of the electroencephalogram (EEG), it has been proven that meditating yogis produce completely different brain waves than - say - stock traders on Wall Street. But HeartMath's heart-driven method extends much further than relaxation through meditation. McCraty notes, \"Meditation is mainly geared towards consciously separating yourself from the reality around you. That has totally different physical consequences than our approach, which is geared towards actively adding positive energy to a particular situation.\" To measure the heart's reaction to particular events, HeartMath uses a relatively new concept - one that is currently a hot item in mainstream medicine - as an indicator of a healthily functioning body: heart rate variability (HRV). Research conducted 10 years ago by Dr Andrew Armour of Dalhouse University in Halifax, Canada showed that the heart has its own neural network-in essence, a little brain. HRV - the rhythm of the time period between two heartbeats - plays a key role in that network. It has now been demonstrated that the heart sends signals to the brain and the hormonal system via nerves which carry the heart rhythm patterns. It doesn't matter so much how many times a heart beats per minute; it's the rhythm of the heartbeat that counts. Childre, McCraty and HeartMath's research team have discovered that certain patterns in the heart rhythm correspond to a particular emotional state. McCraty explains, \"With every heartbeat, information is supplied that affects our emotions, our physical health and the quality of our lives.\" This means that **feelings of compassion, love, care and appreciation produce a smoothly rolling - HeartMath calls it \"coherent\" - heart rhythm, while feelings of anger, frustration, fear and danger emit a jagged and capricious - \"incoherent\" - image.** But this is more than a statistical difference. HeartMath's research shows that a different heart rhythm leads to other chemical and electrical-even neurological-reactions in the body. **Simply put: when people experience love, they not only feel happy and joyful, but they also produce, for example, more DHEA, the hormone that prevents aging, and gives us feelings of", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:050720heartmath.txt:3:8de5362abd0c", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 7393, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "050720heartmath.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "050720heartmath", "chunk_index": 4, "text": "calls it \"coherent\" - heart rhythm, while feelings of anger, frustration, fear and danger emit a jagged and capricious - \"incoherent\" - image.** But this is more than a statistical difference. HeartMath's research shows that a different heart rhythm leads to other chemical and electrical-even neurological-reactions in the body. **Simply put: when people experience love, they not only feel happy and joyful, but they also produce, for example, more DHEA, the hormone that prevents aging, and gives us feelings of youthful vitality.** Not surprisingly, a synthetic form of the hormone is currently sold in pill form at drugstores and health food stores. At the same time, the production of damaging stress hormones like cortisol is reduced. High levels of cortisol have been associated with Alzheimer's disease, diabetes, depression and fatigue. By contrast, a \"loving body\" absorbs less cholesterol, thereby preventing arteries from clogging while boosting production of immunoglobulin A, an important biochemical that boosts immune function. In addition, blood pressure stabilizes. McCraty links this effect to problems many organizations face: \"There is a clear connection between healthcare costs and blood pressure levels. When your blood pressure falls, so do visits to the doctor...\" And so HeartMath concludes that love is both an emotional and a physical state: positive feelings - like love - generate health. The reverse is also true. Someone who is angry produces less DHEA and more cortisol. And so on. **HeartMath's slogan - a change of heart changes everything - pretty much sums it up. ** But how do you \"change your heart?\" According to HeartMath research, it is much simpler than it looks. McCraty says, \"If you consciously shift your attention to a positive emotion, like appreciation or care, or if you allow your thoughts to return to the feeling of a cherished memory, your heart rhythm changes immediately.\" This phenomenon continues to astonish the some 25,000 people who attend HeartMath courses each year. Initially, HeartMath utilized expensive medical equipment to measure and display the heart rhythm. But since 2000 HeartMath has offered a \"do-it-yourself\" equivalent: the Freeze-Framer, an award-winning computer program with an innovative sensor that anyone can install in their computer at home or at work. So far, HeartMath has sold more than 30,000 of these systems. The first time I start up the Freeze-Framer at home and attach the sensor to my finger, a freakish pattern appears on my computer screen. My heart rhythm is all wild peaks and valleys or - in HeartMath jargon - an \"incoherent pattern.\" I then perform my prescribed exercise. I shift my thoughts to the area around my heart, I visualize that I'm breathing in through my heart and out through my solar plexus (the energy point under the breastbone, above the belly button). I remember a sweet memory with my daughter. I feel the warmth of our contact at that moment ... and I see the", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:050720heartmath.txt:4:53b6815ab2e5", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 7394, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "050720heartmath.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "050720heartmath", "chunk_index": 5, "text": "rhythm is all wild peaks and valleys or - in HeartMath jargon - an \"incoherent pattern.\" I then perform my prescribed exercise. I shift my thoughts to the area around my heart, I visualize that I'm breathing in through my heart and out through my solar plexus (the energy point under the breastbone, above the belly button). I remember a sweet memory with my daughter. I feel the warmth of our contact at that moment ... and I see the graph on the computer screen change. The exercise, which I've only been doing for a couple of minutes, is quick and effective. The volatile peaks change into rolling hills on my screen. My incoherent heart rhythm has synchronized into a coherent rhythm. And what I can't see on the line of the graph, but know - from HeartMath research - is that my body is now functioning in a more healthy and wholesome way. The research is convincing. A group of managers from Motorola attended a HeartMath workshop and were tested six months later on the results of their daily exercises. One-quarter of the managers had high blood pressure at the start of the project. After six months, they all had normal blood pressure levels. **In another study with Hewlett-Packard managers, the average blood pressure fell from 138/86 to 128/80. This large an improvement is comparable to the effect of losing nearly 20 kilos (44 pounds).** A recent study of employees at the food and household products multinational Unilever shows that the production of the favourable hormone DHEA increased by an average of 50 percent after six months of HeartMath exercises and rose to 90 percent after nine months. The exercises also work for people with chronic diseases. For example, diabetes patients who performed a total of one hour of HeartMath exercises every week for six months scored significantly better on a number of health aspects crucial to them. Another HeartMath study indicates that the savings on health care costs and absenteeism can run up to $700 U.S. (540 euros) per employee a year. For a company with 1,000 employees, that would mean a savings of $700,000 U.S. (540,000 euros) a year. The fact the exercises are so easy may well be the most promising aspect of the HeartMath system. Bruce Cryer notes, \"Time pressure is continually increasing. No matter how good a program might be for them, many people simply don't take the time to invest in their emotional and physical health every day. People want exercises to take virtually no time, but to yield results. That's the strength of our approach. **You can learn the techniques in five minutes and get positive results if you do them a few times a day for 30 seconds.** When you're on your way to your next meeting, for example. Or when you start up your computer. Or sitting at a stoplight.", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:050720heartmath.txt:5:e861c17fbc6d", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 7395, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "050720heartmath.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "050720heartmath", "chunk_index": 6, "text": "simply don't take the time to invest in their emotional and physical health every day.

Or when you start up your computer. Or sitting at a stoplight. Or waiting to make a phone call. Or before starting to check your e-mails. By making the techniques simple and quick, you can integrate them into your daily schedule without having to drastically change your life.\" Regularly using the Freeze-Framer is particularly helpful in recognizing stress patterns. You gain insight into your own behaviour and the effect of that behaviour on your health. In that respect, the Freeze-Framer works like a thermometer: you get to the point where you don't need to take your temperature any more to know you have a fever. As a result, it becomes ever easier to quickly correct the experience of stress. Cryer says, **\"HeartMath's aim is to eliminate stress. Of course we can't eliminate stressful events from our lives, but we can change our physiological and emotional response to them. The goal is to teach you to recognize which circumstances create stress so you can change your reaction to those situations.** For example, practising a HeartMath technique helps you not to curse if someone cuts you off on the highway, but to react differently. And the most important result is that no damaging stress hormones are released in your body and no damaging comments come out of your mouth that could make the situation much worse.\" Is HeartMath the only effective answer to stress? Clearly not. Every walk on the beach is beneficial. The same goes for an enjoyable concert. And for experiences of friendship and love. There are also other promising initiatives with a comparable focus. Ode previously reported on the work of the Italian Amedeo Maffei (see Ode, June 2002) as well as the computer game Wild Divine (see Ode, April 2004). And there are other projects geared towards synchronising the heart and brain rhythms to stimulate favourable biochemical and electrical processes in our bodies. **But the strength of HeartMath lies in the convincing evidence of the effectiveness of the exercises and their simplicity.** And its approach takes into account the sense of time pressure continually experienced by the stressed target group. Less stress and more health is, of course, enough of a recommendation for following HeartMath's system. But there's more: studies show that the electromagnetic field of the heart (which is created by the heart's electrical system, or electrocardiogram) can be measured from between two and three metres from the body. **HeartMath has discovered that if someone has a coherent heart", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:050720heartmath.txt:6:5ecea4535356", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 7396, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "050720heartmath.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "050720heartmath", "chunk_index": 7, "text": "their simplicity.** And its approach takes into account the sense of time pressure continually experienced by the stressed target group.

But there's more: studies show that the electromagnetic field of the heart (which is created by the heart's electrical system, or electrocardiogram) can be measured from between two and three metres from the body. **HeartMath has discovered that if someone has a coherent heart rhythm, it has a demonstrably positive effect on other people in close proximity to him or her** (and the reverse is also true). Just think about how you feel in the presence of someone who is appreciative or caring, compared to being close to someone angry or frustrated. That is: if your own heart rhythm is coherent, there is a greater chance that your environment will also behave coherently. That is: the health of your environment starts with your own health. That is: changing the world starts with you. Cryer notes how, \"A lot of people feel powerless. Climate change. Poverty. War. Terrorism. There are so many things we could fear in the world. So where do you start as an individual, when the size of the problems seem so daunting? It is important to know that you can have a demonstrably positive effect on the world. **We can change the world, starting with ourselves.\" ** That enthusiasm is behind all the solid research done by HeartMath. This vision also explains why the Institute never opted for quick fixes, but instead preferred building steady proof of concept. Cryer concludes, **\"It is our mission to help the world change, by helping people change. The root of most of our world's problems is a lack of emotional management, a lack of understanding, care, respect and compassion. Most organizations and governments are fairly dysfunctional, because their leaders lack skills to manage themselves emotionally, let alone be an example for others to follow. That dysfunction damages the planet every day. We offer tools that are needed to eradicate major challenges and problems and to prevent wrongs.\"** Those tools help the heart to make love. All you need is love, John Lennon sang.

He claims it is long past time to change this dangerous policy in order to avert a future apocalypse.

McNamara May/June 2005 Robert McNamara is worried. He knows how close we've come. His counsel helped the Kennedy administration avert nuclear catastrophe during the Cuban Missile Crisis. Today, he believes the United States must no longer rely on nuclear weapons as a foreign-policy tool. To do so is immoral, illegal, and dreadfully dangerous. **It is time - well past time, in my view - for the United States to cease its Cold War-style reliance on nuclear weapons as a foreign-policy tool. At the risk of appearing simplistic and provocative, I would characterize current US nuclear weapons policy as immoral, illegal, militarily unnecessary, and dreadfully dangerous.

Russia has roughly 3,800. The strategic forces of Britain, France, and China are considerably smaller, with 200-400 nuclear weapons in each state's arsenal. The new nuclear states of Pakistan and India have fewer than 100 weapons each. North Korea now claims to have developed nuclear weapons, and US intelligence agencies estimate that Pyongyang has enough fissile material for 2-8 bombs. How destructive are these weapons? **The average US warhead has a destructive power 20 times that of the Hiroshima bomb. Of the 8,000 active or operational US warheads, 2,000 are on hair-trigger alert, ready to be launched on 15 minutes' warning. How are these weapons to be used? The United States has never endorsed the policy of \"no first use,\" not during my seven years as secretary or since. We have been and remain prepared to initiate the use of nuclear weapons - by the decision of one person, the president - against either a nuclear or nonnuclear enemy whenever we believe it is in our interest to do so.** For decades, US nuclear forces have been sufficiently strong to absorb a first strike and then inflict \"unacceptable\" damage on an opponent. This has been and (so long as we face a nuclear-armed, potential adversary) must continue to be the foundation of our nuclear deterrent. In my time as secretary of defense, the commander of the US Strategic Air Command (SAC) carried with him a secure telephone, no matter where he went, 24 hours a day, seven days a week, 365 days a year. The telephone of the commander, whose headquarters were in Omaha, Nebraska, was linked to the underground command post of the North American Defense Command, deep inside Cheyenne Mountain, in Colorado, and to the US president, wherever he happened to be. The president always had at hand nuclear release codes in the so-called football, a briefcase carried for the president at all times by a US military officer. **The SAC commander's orders were to answer", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:050723robertmcnamaraapocalypse.txt:1:23d5f7ccc758", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 7400, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "050723robertmcnamaraapocalypse.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "050723robertmcnamaraapocalypse", "chunk_index": 2, "text": "a week, 365 days a year.

The president always had at hand nuclear release codes in the so-called football, a briefcase carried for the president at all times by a US military officer. **The SAC commander's orders were to answer the telephone by no later than the end of the third ring. If it rang, and he was informed that a nuclear attack of enemy ballistic missiles appeared to be under way, he was allowed 2 to 3 minutes to decide whether the warning was valid (over the years, the United States has received many false warnings), and if so, how the United States should respond. He was then given approximately 10 minutes to determine what to recommend, to locate and advise the president, permit the president to discuss the situation with two or three close advisors (presumably the secretary of defense and the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff), and to receive the president's decision and pass it immediately, along with the codes, to the launch sites.** The president essentially had two options: He could decide to ride out the attack and defer until later any decision to launch a retaliatory strike. Or, he could order an immediate retaliatory strike, from a menu of options, thereby launching US weapons that were targeted on the opponent's military-industrial assets. Our opponents in Moscow presumably had and have similar arrangements. The whole situation seems so bizarre as to be beyond belief. **On any given day, as we go about our business, the president is prepared to make a decision within 20 minutes that could launch one of the most devastating weapons in the world. To declare war requires an act of congress, but to launch a nuclear holocaust requires 20 minutes' deliberation by the president and his advisors.** But that is what we have lived with for 40 years. With very few changes, this system remains largely intact, including the \"football,\" the president's constant companion. I was able to change some of these dangerous policies and procedures. My colleagues and I started arms control talks; we installed safeguards to reduce the risk of unauthorized launches; we added options to the nuclear war plans so that the president did not have to choose between an all-or-nothing response, and we eliminated the vulnerable and provocative nuclear missiles in Turkey. I wish I had done more, but we were in the midst of the Cold War, and our options were limited. The United States and our NATO allies faced a strong Soviet and Warsaw Pact conventional threat. Many of the allies (and some in Washington as well) felt strongly that preserving the US option", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:050723robertmcnamaraapocalypse.txt:2:acc2330441c1", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 7401, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "050723robertmcnamaraapocalypse.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "050723robertmcnamaraapocalypse", "chunk_index": 3, "text": "war plans so that the president did not have to choose between an all-or-nothing response, and we eliminated the vulnerable and provocative nuclear missiles in Turkey.

Many of the allies (and some in Washington as well) felt strongly that preserving the US option of launching a first strike was necessary for the sake of keeping the Soviets at bay.** What is shocking is that today, more than a decade after the end of the Cold War, the basic US nuclear policy is unchanged. It has not adapted to the collapse of the Soviet Union. Plans and procedures have not been revised to make the United States or other countries less likely to push the button. At a minimum, we should remove all strategic nuclear weapons from \"hair-trigger\" alert, as others have recommended, including Gen. George Lee Butler, the last commander of SAC. That simple change would greatly reduce the risk of an accidental nuclear launch. It would also signal to other states that the United States is taking steps to end its reliance on nuclear weapons. ** We pledged to work in good faith toward the eventual elimination of nuclear arsenals when we negotiated the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) in 1968. In May, diplomats from more than 180 nations are meeting in New York City to review the NPT and assess whether members are living up to the agreement. The United States is focused, for understandable reasons, on persuading North Korea to rejoin the treaty and on negotiating deeper constraints on Iran's nuclear ambitions. Those states must be convinced to keep the promises they made when they originally signed the NPT - that they would not build nuclear weapons in return for access to peaceful uses of nuclear energy. But the attention of many nations, including some potential new nuclear weapons states, is also on the United States. Keeping such large numbers of weapons, and maintaining them on hair-trigger alert, are potent signs that the United States is not seriously working toward the elimination of its arsenal and raises troubling questions as to why any other state should restrain its nuclear ambitions. **A Preview of the Apocalypse ** The destructive power of nuclear weapons is well known, but given the United States' continued reliance on them, it's worth remembering the danger they present. A 2000 report by the International Physicians for the Prevention of Nuclear War describes the likely effects of a single 1 megaton weapon - dozens of which are contained in the Russian and US inventories. At ground zero, the explosion creates a crater 300 feet deep and 1,200 feet in diameter.

A 2000 report by the International Physicians for the Prevention of Nuclear War describes the likely effects of a single 1 megaton weapon - dozens of which are contained in the Russian and US inventories. At ground zero, the explosion creates a crater 300 feet deep and 1,200 feet in diameter. Within one second, the atmosphere itself ignites into a fireball more than a half-mile in diameter. The surface of the fireball radiates nearly three times the light and heat of a comparable area of the surface of the sun, extinguishing in seconds all life below and radiating outward at the speed of light, causing instantaneous severe burns to people within one to three miles. A blast wave of compressed air reaches a distance of three miles in about 12 seconds, flattening factories and commercial buildings. Debris carried by winds of 250 mph inflicts lethal injuries throughout the area. At least 50 percent of people in the area die immediately, prior to any injuries from radiation or the developing firestorm. Of course, our knowledge of these effects is not entirely hypothetical. **Nuclear weapons, with roughly one seventieth of the power of the 1 megaton bomb just described, were twice used by the United States in August 1945. One atomic bomb was dropped on Hiroshima. Around 80,000 people died immediately; approximately 200,000 died eventually. Later, a similar size bomb was dropped on Nagasaki.** On Nov. 7, 1995, the mayor of Nagasaki recalled his memory of the attack in testimony to the International Court of Justice: Nagasaki became a city of death where not even the sound of insects could be heard. After a while, countless men, women and children began to gather for a drink of water at the banks of nearby Urakami River, their hair and clothing scorched and their burnt skin hanging off in sheets like rags. Begging for help they died one after another in the water or in heaps on the banks.... Four months after the atomic bombing, 74,000 people were dead, and 75,000 had suffered injuries, that is, two-thirds of the city population had fallen victim to this calamity that came upon Nagasaki like a preview of the Apocalypse. Why did so many civilians have to die? Because the civilians, who made up nearly 100 percent of the victims of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, were unfortunately \"co-located\" with Japanese military and industrial targets. Their annihilation, though not the objective of those dropping the bombs, was an inevitable result of the choice of those targets. It is worth noting that during the Cold War, the United States reportedly had dozens of nuclear warheads targeted on Moscow alone, because it contained so many military targets and so much \"industrial capacity.\" Presumably, the Soviets similarly targeted many US cities.

The statement that our nuclear weapons do not target populations per se was and remains totally misleading in the sense that the so-called collateral damage of large nuclear strikes would include tens of millions of innocent civilian dead. **This in a nutshell is what nuclear weapons do: They indiscriminately blast, burn, and irradiate with a speed and finality that are almost incomprehensible. This is exactly what countries like the United States and Russia, with nuclear weapons on hair-trigger alert, continue to threaten every minute of every day in this new 21st century. ** **No Way to Win** I have worked on issues relating to US and NATO nuclear strategy and war plans for more than 40 years. During that time, I have never seen a piece of paper that outlined a plan for the United States or NATO to initiate the use of nuclear weapons with any benefit for the United States or NATO. I have made this statement in front of audiences, including NATO defense ministers and senior military leaders, many times. No one has ever refuted it. **To launch weapons against a nuclear-equipped opponent would be suicidal. To do so against a nonnuclear enemy would be militarily unnecessary, morally repugnant, and politically indefensible. ** I reached these conclusions very soon after becoming secretary of defense. Although I believe Presidents John F. Kennedy and Lyndon Johnson shared my view, it was impossible for any of us to make such statements publicly because they were totally contrary to established NATO policy. **After leaving the Defense Department, I became president of the World Bank. During my 13-year tenure, from 1968 to 1981, I was prohibited, as an employee of an international institution, from commenting publicly on issues of US national security. After my retirement from the bank, I began to reflect on how I, with seven years' experience as secretary of defense, might contribute to an understanding of the issues with which I began my public service career. ** At that time, much was being said and written regarding how the United States could, and why it should, be able to fight and win a nuclear war with the Soviets. This view implied, of course, that nuclear weapons did have military utility; that they could be used in battle with ultimate gain to whoever had the largest force or used them with the greatest acumen.

Having studied these views, **I decided to go public with some information that I knew would be controversial, but that I felt was needed to inject reality into these increasingly unreal discussions about the military utility of nuclear weapons. In articles and speeches, I criticized the fundamentally flawed assumption that nuclear weapons could be used in some limited way. There is no way to effectively contain a nuclear strike** - to keep it from inflicting enormous destruction on civilian life and property, and there is no guarantee against unlimited escalation once the first nuclear strike occurs. We cannot avoid the serious and unacceptable risk of nuclear war until we recognize these facts and base our military plans and policies upon this recognition. I hold these views even more strongly today than I did when I first spoke out against the nuclear dangers our policies were creating. I know from direct experience that US nuclear policy today creates unacceptable risks to other nations and to our own. **What Castro Taught Us ** Among the costs of maintaining nuclear weapons is the risk - to me an unacceptable risk - of use of the weapons either by accident or as a result of misjudgment or miscalculation in times of crisis. The Cuban Missile Crisis demonstrated that the United States and the Soviet Union - and indeed the rest of the world - came within a hair's breadth of nuclear disaster in October 1962. Indeed, according to former Soviet military leaders, at the height of the crisis, Soviet forces in Cuba possessed 162 nuclear warheads, including at least 90 tactical warheads. At about the same time, Cuban President Fidel Castro asked the Soviet ambassador to Cuba to send a cable to Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev stating that Castro urged him to counter a US attack with a nuclear response. Clearly, there was a high risk that in the face of a US attack, which many in the US government were prepared to recommend to President Kennedy, the Soviet forces in Cuba would have decided to use their nuclear weapons rather than lose them. Only a few years ago did we learn that the four Soviet submarines trailing the US Naval vessels near Cuba each carried torpedoes with nuclear warheads. Each of the sub commanders had the authority to launch his torpedoes. The situation was even more frightening because, as the lead commander recounted to me, the subs were out of", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:050723robertmcnamaraapocalypse.txt:6:2c2777ef3196", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 7405, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "050723robertmcnamaraapocalypse.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "050723robertmcnamaraapocalypse", "chunk_index": 7, "text": "prepared to recommend to President Kennedy, the Soviet forces in Cuba would have decided to use their nuclear weapons rather than lose them. Only a few years ago did we learn that the four Soviet submarines trailing the US Naval vessels near Cuba each carried torpedoes with nuclear warheads. Each of the sub commanders had the authority to launch his torpedoes. The situation was even more frightening because, as the lead commander recounted to me, the subs were out of communication with their Soviet bases, and they continued their patrols for four days after Khrushchev announced the withdrawal of the missiles from Cuba. The lesson, if it had not been clear before, was made so at a conference on the crisis held in Havana in 1992, when we first began to learn from former Soviet officials about their preparations for nuclear war in the event of a US invasion. Near the end of that meeting, I asked Castro whether he would have recommended that Khrushchev use the weapons in the face of a US invasion, and if so, how he thought the United States would respond. \"We started from the assumption that if there was an invasion of Cuba, nuclear war would erupt,\" Castro replied. \"We were certain of that.... [W]e would be forced to pay the price that we would disappear.\" He continued, \"Would I have been ready to use nuclear weapons? Yes, I would have agreed to the use of nuclear weapons.\" And he added, \"If Mr. McNamara or Mr. Kennedy had been in our place, and had their country been invaded, or their country was going to be occupied ... I believe they would have used tactical nuclear weapons.\" I hope that President Kennedy and I would not have behaved as Castro suggested we would have. His decision would have destroyed his country. Had we responded in a similar way the damage to the United States would have been unthinkable. But **human beings are fallible. In conventional war, mistakes cost lives, sometimes thousands of lives. However, if mistakes were to affect decisions relating to the use of nuclear forces, there would be no learning curve. They would result in the destruction of nations. The indefinite combination of human fallibility and nuclear weapons carries a very high risk of nuclear catastrophe. There is no way to reduce the risk to acceptable levels, other than to first eliminate the hair-trigger alert policy and later to eliminate or nearly eliminate nuclear weapons.** The United States should move immediately to institute these actions, in cooperation with Russia. That is the lesson of the Cuban Missile Crisis. **A Dangerous Obsession ** On Nov. 13, 2001, President George W. Bush announced that he had told Russian President Vladimir Putin that the United States would reduce \"operationally deployed nuclear warheads\" from approximately 5,300 to a level between 1,700 and 2,200 over the next decade.", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:050723robertmcnamaraapocalypse.txt:7:a3d562e80be7", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 7406, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "050723robertmcnamaraapocalypse.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "050723robertmcnamaraapocalypse", "chunk_index": 8, "text": "hair-trigger alert policy and later to eliminate or nearly eliminate nuclear weapons.** The United States should move immediately to institute these actions, in cooperation with Russia.

Bush announced that he had told Russian President Vladimir Putin that the United States would reduce \"operationally deployed nuclear warheads\" from approximately 5,300 to a level between 1,700 and 2,200 over the next decade. This scaling back would approach the 1,500 to 2,200 range that Putin had proposed for Russia. However, the Bush administration's Nuclear Posture Review, mandated by the US Congress and issued in January 2002, presents quite a different story. It assumes that strategic offensive nuclear weapons in much larger numbers than 1,700 to 2,200 will be part of US military forces for the next several decades. Although the number of deployed warheads will be reduced to 3,800 in 2007 and to between 1,700 and 2,200 by 2012, the warheads and many of the launch vehicles taken off deployment will be maintained in a \"responsive\" reserve from which they could be moved back to the operationally deployed force. The Nuclear Posture Review received little attention from the media. But its emphasis on strategic offensive nuclear weapons deserves vigorous public scrutiny. Although any proposed reduction is welcome, it is doubtful that survivors - if there were any - of an exchange of 3,200 warheads (the US and Russian numbers projected for 2012), with a destructive power approximately 65,000 times that of the Hiroshima bomb, could detect a difference between the effects of such an exchange and one that would result from the launch of the current US and Russian forces totaling about 12,000 warheads. In addition to projecting the deployment of large numbers of strategic nuclear weapons far into the future, the Bush administration is planning an extensive and expensive series of programs to sustain and modernize the existing nuclear force and to begin studies for new launch vehicles, as well as new warheads for all of the launch platforms. Some members of the administration have called for new nuclear weapons that could be used as bunker busters against underground shelters (such as the shelters Saddam Hussein used in Baghdad). New production facilities for fissile materials would need to be built to support the expanded force. The plans provide for integrating a national ballistic missile defense into the new triad of offensive weapons to enhance the nation's ability to use its \"power projection forces\" by improving our ability to counterattack an enemy. The Bush administration also announced that it has no intention to ask congress to ratify the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT), and, though no decision to test has been made, the administration has ordered the national laboratories to begin research on new nuclear weapons designs and to prepare the underground test", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:050723robertmcnamaraapocalypse.txt:8:fc8480d711b3", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 7407, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "050723robertmcnamaraapocalypse.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "050723robertmcnamaraapocalypse", "chunk_index": 9, "text": "ballistic missile defense into the new triad of offensive weapons to enhance the nation's ability to use its \"power projection forces\" by improving our ability to counterattack an enemy.

Clearly, the Bush administration assumes that nuclear weapons will be part of US military forces for at least the next several decades. Good faith participation in international negotiation on nuclear disarmament - including participation in the CTBT - is a legal and political obligation of all parties to the NPT that entered into force in 1970 and was extended indefinitely in 1995. **The Bush administration's nuclear program, alongside its refusal to ratify the CTBT, will be viewed, with reason, by many nations as equivalent to a US break from the treaty. It says to the nonnuclear weapons nations, \"We, with the strongest conventional military force in the world, require nuclear weapons in perpetuity, but you, facing potentially well-armed opponents, are never to be allowed even one nuclear weapon.\" ** If the United States continues its current nuclear stance, over time, substantial proliferation of nuclear weapons will almost surely follow. Some, or all, of such nations as Egypt, Japan, Saudi Arabia, Syria, and Taiwan will very likely initiate nuclear weapons programs, increasing both the risk of use of the weapons and the diversion of weapons and fissile materials into the hands of rogue states or terrorists. Diplomats and intelligence agencies believe Osama bin Laden has made several attempts to acquire nuclear weapons or fissile materials. It has been widely reported that Sultan Bashiruddin Mahmood, former director of Pakistan's nuclear reactor complex, met with bin Laden several times. Were al Qaeda to acquire fissile materials, especially enriched uranium, its ability to produce nuclear weapons would be great. The knowledge of how to construct a simple gun-type nuclear device, like the one we dropped on Hiroshima, is now widespread. Experts have little doubt that terrorists could construct such a primitive device if they acquired the requisite enriched uranium material. Indeed, just last summer, at a meeting of the National Academy of Sciences, former Secretary of Defense William J. Perry said, \"I have never been more fearful of a nuclear detonation than now.... There is a greater than 50 percent probability of a nuclear strike on US targets within a decade.\" I share his fears. **A Moment of Decision ** **We are at a critical moment in human history - perhaps not as dramatic as that of the Cuban Missile Crisis, but a moment no less crucial.

Neither the Bush administration, the congress, the American people, nor the people of other nations have debated the merits of alternative, long-range nuclear weapons policies for their countries or the world. They have not examined the military utility of the weapons; the risk of inadvertent or accidental use; the moral and legal considerations relating to the use or threat of use of the weapons; or the impact of current policies on proliferation. Such debates are long overdue. If they are held, I believe they will conclude, as have I and an increasing number of senior military leaders, politicians, and civilian security experts: We must move promptly toward the elimination - or near elimination - of all nuclear weapons. For many, there is a strong temptation to cling to the strategies of the past 40 years.

Originally published in the scholarly [*Journal of Psychohistory*](http://www.psychohistory.com), this meticulously researched article first presents a multitude of strange and unexplained facts around 9/11. Yet even more deep and penetrating is a [later section](#1) on the fascinating psychosocial factors which likely led to that fateful day and the wars which followed. A total of 98 footnotes (included below the essay) support the thorough, eye-opening research presented. **One of the least-discussed factors which plays a key role in global politics is childhood abuse.** If you examine the background of individuals in prisons and psychiatric hospitals, you will find that the vast majority have suffered from childhood abuse, which includes both sexual and physical abuse. The same may be true of most of the corrupt and power-hungry politicians in the world. The good news is that, thanks to greater public awareness, the incidence of child abuse has decreased over recent decades. Just 50 years ago, [most child abuse went unreported](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_Protective_Services#History) and abused children had nowhere to turn. This decrease may be an important factor in the [dramatic decline in violent crime](https://www.WantToKnow.info/g/violent_crime_rates_reduction) over the last 40 years. As healthier generations grow up and replace our current leaders, we will likely move towards a more peaceful and loving society.

However, before it began, there were indications that some people wanted a far more destructive war than that which ensued. For example,** ridiculous as it may now sound, it was suggested that Britain and America might use nuclear weapons against Iraq. **As [The Guardian](http://www.guardian.co.uk/nuclear/article/0,2763,871128,00.html) reported at the time: \"From last year's US defence review and the testimony of the Defence Secretary, Geoffrey Hoon ... it was clear that a major change in the US and UK nuclear policy was taking place. For the first time, Britain and America were contemplating using nuclear weapons against an enemy using only chemical or biological weapons. Referring to 'states of concern', and Saddam Hussein in particular, Mr Hoon []: 'They can be absolutely confident that in the right conditions we would be willing to use our nuclear weapons.'\" [1] **A month before the invasion, [Hoon repeated his warning](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/2717939.stm): \"Saddam can be absolutely confident that in the right conditions we would be willing to use nuclear weapons.\" [**2] As investigative journalist [John Pilger](http://www.commondreams.org/views03/0815-06.htm) points out: \"No British minister has ever made such an outright threat.\" [3] Thankfully, the invasion passed without our resorting to nuclear weapons. But it seemed the desire for a bigger conflict remained, with attempts beginning almost immediately to find a new, more formidable enemy. In particular, Iran and Syria seemed next on the list for 'liberation.' At a press conference in July 2003, President Bush issued a [stern warning](http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2003/jul/22/usa.duncancampbell1) to both countries, accusing them of harboring terrorists. \"This behaviour is completely unacceptable,\" he said, \"and states that continue to harbour terrorists will be held completely accountable.\" [4] Three months later, U.S. Under Secretary of State for Arms Control [John Bolton told journalists](http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2003/oct/10/iran.richardnortontaylor): \"There is awareness of the threat posed by Iran and consensus that threat has to be eliminated.\" [5] Yet these warnings failed to capture much public interest. Instead, there was a growing interest around the investigation into the attacks of September 11, 2001. Previously, the press had largely ignored the work of the National Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States, better known as the \"9-11 Commission.\" When it held its second public hearings in May 2003 on the key issue of air defense, the New York Times and Los Angeles Times failed to write any articles about it.

[6] Suddenly though, in March 2004 the Commission became the center of attention when former White House security expert Richard Clarke publicly testified before it and criticized the Bush administration for failing to address terrorism when it first came into office. Since then, the 9/11 Commission remained a major news story and the book of its final report became an instant bestseller. However, the mass media were still overlooking the fact that increasing numbers of people were seriously questioning the entire official account of 9/11. More and more books had been released around the world giving evidence of possible U.S. government complicity in the attacks. Polls suggested that millions of people were suspicious:** A [Zogby poll](http://zogby.com/news/2004/08/30/half-of-new-yorkers-believe-us-leaders-had-foreknowledge-of-impending-9-11-attacks-and-consciously-f/) in late August 2004 found 49 per cent of New York City residents and 41 per cent of New York citizens overall agreed that \"some leaders in the U.S. Government knew in advance that attacks were planned on or around September 11, 2001, and that they consciously failed to take action.\" **[7] [A survey](http://www.commondreams.org/views04/0528-09.htm) three months earlier found 63 per cent of Canadians believed the U.S. Government had \"prior knowledge of the plans for the events of September 11th, and failed to take appropriate action to stop them.\" [8] A [July 2003 poll](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/germany/1447232/German-Sept-11-theory-stokes-anti-US-feeling.html) had found almost a fifth of Germans believed the U.S. Government, or elements within it, were responsible for organizing the attacks. [9] With attempts at identifying a new 'external enemy' so far failing, I believe it is possible that, instead, this growing suspicion around 9/11 will develop into an unprecedented public scandal. But what are these suspicions about? Are they simply the result of rumour and 'urban legend,' or could some of the disturbing allegations now being made be found true in the future? In this article, I will examine some of the arguments put forward by 9/11 skeptics, along with supporting evidence. Then I will examine some of the psychohistorical evidence that shows why we could be heading for a major scandal over the events of 9/11. Until the controversy around 9/11 is brought into the open and investigated properly, it is up to individuals to draw their own conclusions. However, in my opinion,** the volume of evidence now gathered is enough to suggest a massive scandal is a real possibility**. The implications of this would be extraordinary. As one of the most prominent 9/11 skeptics, former German government minister [Andreas von Blow,", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:050726scandal911.txt:2:4e76a822e993", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 7412, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "050726scandal911.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "050726scandal911", "chunk_index": 3, "text": "why we could be heading for a major scandal over the events of 9/11.

Yet details of what he did during the attacks are sketchy and from what we currently know, he did nothing in response to the crisis until it was too late to make a difference. **[According to Rumsfeld](http://www.defense.gov/transcripts/transcript.aspx?transcriptid=2603), on the morning of September 11 he was hosting a breakfast meeting at the Pentagon for some members of Congress. He told them that \"sometime in the next two, four, six, eight, ten, twelve months there would be an event that would occur in the world that would be sufficiently shocking that it would remind people again how important it is to have a strong healthy defense department.\"** [11] Soon after, someone walked in and gave him a note saying a plane had hit the World Trade Center. Yet Rumsfeld apparently was not moved to take action. \"[W]e adjourned the meeting, and I went in to get my CIA briefing,\" [he has said](http://www.defense.gov/transcripts/transcript.aspx?transcriptid=2603). [12] **Whilst in his office with the CIA briefer, Rumsfeld says he was told of the second plane hitting the WTC. Yet he went ahead with a meeting in his private dining room at the Pentagon with his deputy, Paul Wolfowitz and U.S. Representative Christopher Cox, to discuss how to win votes for Bush's defense plan**. During this meeting, Rumsfeld was apparently oblivious to the fact that an airplane was heading towards Washington. However, [he made another prediction](http://web.archive.org/web/20020817051201/http://cox.house.gov/html/release.cfm?id=33): \"let me tell you, I've been around the block a few times,\" he told Representative Cox. \"There will be another event.\" For emphasis, he repeated: \"There will be another event.\" [13] Just minutes later the Pentagon was hit. [Rumsfeld says](http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn/A17798-2004Mar23): \"I went outside to determine what had happened. I was not there long because I was back in the Pentagon with a crisis action team shortly before or after 10:00 a.m. On my return from the crash site and before going to the executive support center, I had one or more calls in my office, one of which was with the president.\" [14] **Rumsfeld didn't enter the National Military Command Center within the Pentagon though until 10.30. Brigadier [General Montague Winfield says](http://911research.wtc7.net/cache/pentagon/attack/abcnews091102_jenningsinterviews.html): \"For 30 minutes we couldn't find him.\"** [15] As the", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:050726scandal911.txt:3:0d5162b2500d", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 7413, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "050726scandal911.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "050726scandal911", "chunk_index": 4, "text": "long because I was back in the Pentagon with a crisis action team shortly before or after 10:00 a.m. On my return from the crash site and before going to the executive support center, I had one or more calls in my office, one of which was with the president.\" [14] **Rumsfeld didn't enter the National Military Command Center within the Pentagon though until 10.30.

Yet, [according to military procedure](http://www.dtic.mil/doctrine/jel/cjcsd/cjcsi/3610_01a.pdf), if the Federal Aviation Administration were to notify the National Military Command Center of a hijacking, with the exception of \"immediate responses\" the NMCC was required to \"forward requests for DOD assistance to the Secretary of Defense for approval.\" [17] Of course, 9/11 would easily come under the heading of \"immediate responses.\" All the same, Rumsfeld has yet to be asked whether he was contacted in line with this military procedure and, if so, what did he do in response? Interestingly, since 9/11 Donald Rumsfeld has made statements suggesting why he may have wanted an event like 9/11 to occur. For example, in a [televised interview](http://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/middle_east/july-dec03/rumsfeld_09-10.html) two years after the attacks, he described how he thinks about what a senior leader in the Gulf told him, that maybe 9/11 was \"a blessing in disguise,\" and a \"wake-up call\" for the world to deal with the growing threat of terrorism. Rumsfeld said he agreed with this, that 9/11 was indeed a 'wake-up call.' [18] He wrote a similar thing in his [prepared testimony](http://www.9-11commission.gov/hearings/hearing8/rumsfeld_statement.pdf) to the 9/11 Commission: \"Think about what has been done since the September 11th attacks: two state sponsors of terrorism have been removed from power, a 90-nation coalition has been formed which is cooperating on a number of levels... All of these actions are putting pressure on terrorist networks. Taken together, they represent a collective effort that is unprecedented. [19] **DICK CHENEY ON 9/11 ** Based upon mainstream accounts, Vice President Cheney's actions during the attacks appear less suspicious than those of Bush and Rumsfeld. However, there are some odd contradictions in the reports of what he did. On the morning of September 11, before learning about the attacks, Dick Cheney was in his office in the White House. According to the 9/11 Commission, just before 9 a.m. he was preparing for a meeting when his assistant \"told him to turn on his television because a plane had struck the North Tower of the World Trade Center.\" [20] Cheney subsequently saw the second aircraft hitting the South Tower. Then, \"just before 9:36,\" the Secret Service ordered the evacuation of the vice president and agents took him down to", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:050726scandal911.txt:4:795f8837e431", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 7414, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "050726scandal911.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "050726scandal911", "chunk_index": 5, "text": "attacks, Dick Cheney was in his office in the White House. According to the 9/11 Commission, just before 9 a.m. he was preparing for a meeting when his assistant \"told him to turn on his television because a plane had struck the North Tower of the World Trade Center.\" [20] Cheney subsequently saw the second aircraft hitting the South Tower. Then, \"just before 9:36,\" the Secret Service ordered the evacuation of the vice president and agents took him down to the Presidential Emergency Operations Center, the bunker below the East Wing of the White House. \"The Vice President entered the underground tunnel leading to the shelter at 9:37.\" [21] However, according to White House photographer David Bohrer who was present at the time, this evacuation occurred just after 9 a.m. [22] Furthermore, Transportation Secretary Norman Mineta described before the 9/11 Commission how a young man had come into the PEOC to inform the vice president of the approach towards Washington of the aircraft that hit the Pentagon. [According to Mineta](http://www.google.com/search?q=mineta+9%2F11+testimony&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8&aq=t&rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&client=firefox-a), this occurred around 9:25 or 9:26. [23] This suggests that the report of Cheney only reaching the underground tunnel leading to the shelter at 9:37 is incorrect. If Cheney were in fact evacuated soon after 9, why would it later be claimed this took place about half an hour later? One possibility is that it was to make the failure of the Secret Service to evacuate President Bush from his location that morning appear less suspicious. (See below.) Alternatively, if Michael Ruppert's allegations about the vice president's involvement in the attacks are correct, then this claim could simply be an attempt to conceal his complicity. Soon after 9:15, Cheney spoke over the phone with the president, who was at a school in Florida that morning. Also, \"sometime before 10:10 to 10:15,\" he reportedly phoned the president to discuss the rules of engagement for the combat air patrol above Washington. Supposedly, he recommended the president authorize the military to shoot down any civilian airliners that might be under the control of hijackers. [Bush later recalled](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A42754-2002Jan26.html) his response being \"You bet.\" [24] The president also emphasized in his private meeting with the 9/11 Commission that he had authorized the shootdown of hijacked aircraft. [25] This is an important point, because the shooting down of a wayward aircraft before it crashed into a populated area could save many lives. Yet, according to the 9/11 Commission, \"there is no documentary evidence for this call.\" [26] [Newsweek adds](http://www.newsweek.com/2004/06/27/who-was-really-in-charge.html): \"Nor did the real-time notes taken by two others in the room, Cheney's chief of staff, 'Scooter' Libby -- who is known for his meticulous record-keeping -- or Cheney's wife, Lynne, reflect that such a phone call between Bush and Cheney occurred or that such a major decision as shooting down a U.S. airliner was discussed.\" [27] According to Newsweek, some of the Commission's staff were highly", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:050726scandal911.txt:5:b391c29c3030", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 7415, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "050726scandal911.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "050726scandal911", "chunk_index": 6, "text": "9/11 Commission, \"there is no documentary evidence for this call.\" [26] [Newsweek adds](http://www.newsweek.com/2004/06/27/who-was-really-in-charge.html): \"Nor did the real-time notes taken by two others in the room, Cheney's chief of staff, 'Scooter' Libby -- who is known for his meticulous record-keeping -- or Cheney's wife, Lynne, reflect that such a phone call between Bush and Cheney occurred or that such a major decision as shooting down a U.S. airliner was discussed.\" [27] According to Newsweek, some of the Commission's staff were highly skeptical of Cheney's account, with one well-informed source claiming some of them \"flat out didn't believe the call ever took place.\" [28] All the same, whether or not Bush authorized him to do so, \"by the time Cheney issued his shoot-down order, between 10:10 and 10:15 a.m., United Flight 93, the last plane-turned-missile on 9/11, had already crashed in Pennsylvania (at 10:03 a.m.).\" [29] Furthermore, **it appears that Cheney -- along with Bush -- was reluctant for 9/11 to be investigated: When then Senate Majority Leader [Tom Daschle appeared](http://www.kolumbus.fi/sy-k/911/Daschle.htm) on NBC's Meet the Press in May 2002, he said Cheney had, on January 24 that year, urged him not to investigate the events of September 11. ** **Daschle added that four days later Bush made the same request. When the program's moderator Tim Russert asked: \"It wasn't, 'Let's not have a national commission, but let's have the intelligence committees look into this,' it was 'No investigation by anyone, period'?\" Daschle replied: \"That's correct.\" He added that the request had been repeated on \"other dates following.\" [30] ** **GEORGE W. BUSH ON 9/11 ** September 11, 2001 was the most important day of George W. Bush's life. As American president he was commander in chief of the U.S. armed forces. His actions were crucial. According to the 9/11 Commission, the only people that day with authority to order the shooting down of a civilian plane if, say, it were heading towards a populated area (like the World Trade Center or the Pentagon) were the president or the secretary of defense. [31] I have already shown that Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld was apparently 'out of the loop' during the attacks. What then did Commander in Chief Bush do? Before examining this question, it is important to recognise that the U.S. president does not travel alone. He takes with him an entire staff, including members of the Secret Service, who are responsible for his safety. The president's travelling entourage have the best communications equipment in the world. They have contact with, or can easily reach, the cabinet, the National Military Command Center in the Pentagon, the FAA and other Secret Service agents. [32] We might therefore assume George Bush would have been one of the first people informed of the extraordinary chain of events unfolding on September 11. **Furthermore, Bush's location for that morning was made public four days previously, on September 7:", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:050726scandal911.txt:6:5c27081a8679", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 7416, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "050726scandal911.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "050726scandal911", "chunk_index": 7, "text": "his safety.

They have contact with, or can easily reach, the cabinet, the National Military Command Center in the Pentagon, the FAA and other Secret Service agents. [32] We might therefore assume George Bush would have been one of the first people informed of the extraordinary chain of events unfolding on September 11. **Furthermore, Bush's location for that morning was made public four days previously, on September 7: He would be in Sarasota, Florida, to \"continue his focus on reading and education.\" [33] We might assume then that once it was recognised that America was under attack, the president would have been considered a potential target and immediate action would have been taken to protect him and ensure the safety of all around him. ** **Yet, despite the horrifying sequence of events in progress, Bush continued with his pre-planned visit to the Emma E. Booker Elementary School in Sarasota, where he listened to a class full of children reading. He remained at the school until around 9:35 a.m. [34] -- nearly 50 minutes after the first plane hit the WTC and over half an hour after the second plane hit. Incredibly, the president's support team, including the Secret Service, allowed this. ** According to Philip Melanson, an expert on the Secret Service, Bush should have been removed from the school immediately after Flight 175 hit the second WTC tower. Melanson says: \"With an unfolding terrorist attack, the procedure should have been to get the president to the closest secure location as quickly as possible, which clearly is not a school. You're safer in that presidential limo, which is bombproof and blastproof and bulletproof.\" [35] Furthermore, considering the president's responsibilities as commander in chief, Melanson adds that Bush's limousine had key advantages: \"In the presidential limo, the communications system is almost duplicative of the White House -- he can do almost anything from there but he can't do much sitting in a school.\" [36] Bush was informed of the second plane hitting the WTC when, around 9:05, his Chief of Staff Andrew Card came across the classroom and reportedly whispered to him: \"A second plane hit the second tower. America is under attack.\" [37] According to the 9/11 Commission: \"The President told us his instinct was to project calm, not to have the country see an excited reaction at a moment of crisis.\" [38] Furthermore, \"The Secret Service told us they were anxious to move the President to a safer location, but did not think it imperative for him to run out the door.\" [39] Yet this inaction could have had disastrous consequences. In the words of 9/11 researchers Allan Wood and Paul Thompson: \"Why hasn't Bush's security staff been criticized for their completely inexplicable decision to stay at the school?

And why didn't Bush's concern for the children extend to not making them and the rest of the 200 or so people at the school terrorist targets?\" [40] **As the reporter Gail Sheehy concludes, the final report of the 9/11 Commission shows that on the morning of September 11, \"the president and the other top officials in charge of the systems to defend the country from attack were, in essence, missing in action: They did not communicate, did not coordinate a response to the catastrophe, and in some cases did not even get involved in discussions about the attacks until after all of the hijacked planes had crashed.\"** [41] With the best communications in the world available to him, we might assume Bush would have been one of the first people informed of the hijackings and the first plane hitting the WTC. Yet according to official accounts, he remained oblivious even whilst millions of people saw what had happened on television. Strangely, there have been at least seven different accounts of when and from whom Bush first heard of Flight 11 crashing into the WTC. [42] As Allan Wood and Paul Thompson note, Bush's own recollections only add to the confusion: **\"Less than two months after the attacks, Bush made the preposterous claim that he had watched the first attack as it happened on live television.... On December 4, 2001, Bush was asked: \"How did you feel when you heard about the terrorist attack?\" [As reported on CNN,] [Bush replied](http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0112/04/se.04.html), \"I was sitting outside the classroom waiting to go in, and I saw an airplane hit the tower -- the TV was obviously on.... I said, it must have been a horrible accident.\" [43] ** **Yet, as Wood and Thompson point out, \"There was no film footage of the first attack until at least the following day.\"** They continue: \"It's doubly strange why his advisors didn't correct him or -- at the very least -- stop him from repeating the same story only four weeks later. On January 5, 2002, [Bush stated](http://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2002/01/20020105-3.html): \"Well, I was sitting in a schoolhouse in Florida ... and my Chief of Staff -- well, first of all, when we walked into the classroom, I had seen this plane fly into the first building. There was a TV set on.\" [44] On the morning of 9/11, Bush promised that he had \"ordered that the full resources of the federal government go ... to conduct", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:050726scandal911.txt:8:1a98e35046b3", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 7418, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "050726scandal911.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "050726scandal911", "chunk_index": 9, "text": "repeating the same story only four weeks later.

There was a TV set on.\" [44] On the morning of 9/11, Bush promised that he had \"ordered that the full resources of the federal government go ... to conduct a full-scale investigation to hunt down and to find those folks who committed this act.\" [45] Yet it appears more like he has tried to hinder investigations. As Salon reported in June 2003: \"The White House long opposed the formation of a blue-ribbon Sept. 11 commission, some say, and even now that panel is underfunded and struggling to build momentum. And, they say, the administration is suppressing a 900-page congressional study, possibly out of fear that the findings will be politically damaging to Bush. **\"We've been fighting for nearly 21 months -- fighting the administration, the White House,\" says Monica Gabrielle. Her husband, Richard, an insurance broker who worked for Aon Corp. on the 103rd floor of the World Trade Center's Tower 2, died during the attacks. \"As soon as we started looking for answers we were blocked, put off and ignored at every stop of the way. We were shocked. The White House is just blocking everything.\" ** Another 9/11 family advocate ... was more blunt: \"Bush has done everything in his power to squelch this [9/11] commission and prevent it from happening.\" [46] After opposing the creation of the 9/11 Commission, the White House wanted to limit any appearance by the president to just one hour spent with two of the commissioners. A compromise was met such that George Bush did eventually meet with the Commission on April 29, 2004, but only under stringent conditions. Bush had to have Dick Cheney at his side, testifying at the same time; testimony was given in private and not under oath; no press coverage was allowed; and no recordings or transcripts were made of what they said. [47] Further suspicion had been raised just over two weeks earlier, when the White House was forced to release a daily intelligence briefing given to the president whilst on vacation at his ranch in Crawford, Texas, five weeks before 9/11. **[The briefing](http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/NSAEBB/NSAEBB116/pdb8-6-2001.pdf) was titled \"Bin Laden Determined To Strike in US,\" and stated: \"FBI information ... indicates patterns of suspicious activity in this country consistent with preparations for hijackings or other types of attacks, including recent surveillance of federal buildings in New York.... CIA and the FBI are investigating a call to our Embassy in the UAE in May saying that a group of Bin Laden supporters was in the US planning attacks with explosives.\" [48] Despite receiving this, according to the New York", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:050726scandal911.txt:9:3dbfcb7c76e5", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 7419, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "050726scandal911.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "050726scandal911", "chunk_index": 10, "text": "\"Bin Laden Determined To Strike in US,\" and stated: \"FBI information ... indicates patterns of suspicious activity in this country consistent with preparations for hijackings or other types of attacks, including recent surveillance of federal buildings in New York.... CIA and the FBI are investigating a call to our Embassy in the UAE in May saying that a group of Bin Laden supporters was in the US planning attacks with explosives.\" [48] Despite receiving this, according to the New York Times, \"Bush broke off from work early and spent most of that day fishing.\" [49] ** What is also interesting is that **several key members of the Bush administration, including Cheney, Rumsfeld and Paul Wolfowitz, had been members of a neoconservative think-tank called the Project for the New American Century (PNAC)**. In September 2000, PNAC wrote a report called Rebuilding America's Defenses: Strategy, Forces and Resources for a New Century, which they hoped would be \"a road map for the nation's immediate and future defense plans.\" In it they complained: \"The post-Cold War world will not remain a relatively peaceful place if we continue to neglect foreign and defense matters.\" However, they added: \"serious attention, careful thought, and the willingness to devote adequate resources to maintaining America's military strength can make the world safer and American strategic interests more secure now and in the future.\" [50] **They stated that to \"preserve American military preeminence in the coming decades\" America would need to undergo a \"military transformation.\" [51] However, they wrote, this transformation would be \"a long one, absent some catastrophic and catalyzing event -- like a new Pearl Harbor.**\" [52] One year later, 9/11 happened. As George W. Bush wrote in his diary that night: \"The Pearl Harbor of the 21st century took place today.\" [53] After this catastrophic, catalyzing event, actions proposed by the Project for the New American Century soon came into force. As John Pilger wrote of PNAC: \"[In 2000] it recommended an increase in arms-spending by $48bn so that Washington could \"fight and win multiple, simultaneous major theatre wars\". This has happened. It said the United States should develop \"bunker-buster\" nuclear weapons and make \"star wars\" a national priority. This is happening. It said that, in the event of Bush taking power, Iraq should be a target. And so it is. [54] Furthermore, during his 2000 election campaign and after, Bush repeatedly promised a budget surplus, except in the event of a recession, war or a national emergency. In the days after 9/11, he said to his budget director: \"Lucky me. I hit the trifecta.\" [55] (A 'trifecta' is a kind of bet that requires picking the top three finishers in a race.) With so much suspicious evidence, one lawyer, Stanley Hilton -- a former aide to Senator Bob Dole -- has filed a $7 billion suit on behalf of the families of 14 victims of", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:050726scandal911.txt:10:af69ebea2b0d", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 7420, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "050726scandal911.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "050726scandal911", "chunk_index": 11, "text": "except in the event of a recession, war or a national emergency.

With so much suspicious evidence, one lawyer, Stanley Hilton -- a former aide to Senator Bob Dole -- has filed a $7 billion suit on behalf of the families of 14 victims of the 9/11 attacks, alleging that Bush, along with Cheney, Rumsfeld and others, actually ordered 9/11 to happen for political gain. Hilton says he has incriminating documents and witnesses showing this. Calling it \"the biggest act of treason and mass murder in American history,\" he claims that 9/11 was a 'decoy operation': \"You make the people focus on the decoy to avoid looking at the real criminals. So they are focusing on these so-called nineteen hijackers and saying, 'Oh, it must have been these Arabs.' When, in fact, the guilty person is at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue -- sitting in the Oval Office.\" [56] I have already discussed White House attempts to prevent or hinder any official inquiry into 9/11. But another less known example, where there has been a lack of investigation and a suppression of important evidence relating to 9/11, is in the unlikely situation of the retirement community that is Venice, in southwestern Florida. **THE MOHAMED ATTA MYTH ** Of the four alleged 9/11 suicide-pilots, three had been in attendance at two flight schools at the tiny airport in Venice, Florida: Huffman Aviation and Florida Flight Training. Both were owned by Dutch men who purchased the schools within months of each other, in 1999. Soon after they took over, the schools began training unprecedented numbers of Arab flight students. [57] Yet Huffman Aviation and Florida Flight Training, along with the dubious characters who ran them, have so far avoided any serious investigation or media attention. One man who has tried to make up for this is investigative reporter Daniel Hopsicker, who spent two years following the attacks in Venice, examining the training of the alleged hijackers. He reports his findings in his book [*Welcome to Terrorland: Mohamed Atta & the 9-11 Cover-up in Florida*](http://www.amazon.com/Welcome-Terrorland-Mohamed-Cover-up-Florida/dp/0975290673/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1313703312&sr=8-1). As well as describing evidence of large-scale illegal activity going on in and around the Venice Airport, this book casts serious doubt upon the official account of who the hijackers really were. **We have all heard how these 19 alleged hijackers were Islamic extremists. Yet evidence uncovered by Hopsicker, particularly regarding alleged ringleader Mohamed Atta, depicts unlikely personalities and lifestyles for a bunch of religious fanatics. For example, almost totally ignored by the mainstream press is that Atta had an American girlfriend for over two months whilst in Venice, with whom he would go out clubbing almost every night. ** **At the time, this attractive", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:050726scandal911.txt:11:0a2e6753fd75", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 7421, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "050726scandal911.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "050726scandal911", "chunk_index": 12, "text": "account of who the hijackers really were. **We have all heard how these 19 alleged hijackers were Islamic extremists.

For example, almost totally ignored by the mainstream press is that Atta had an American girlfriend for over two months whilst in Venice, with whom he would go out clubbing almost every night. ** **At the time, this attractive young woman -- Amanda Keller -- had spiky pink hair and was working as a 'lingerie model' for an escort service called Fantasies & Lace. Atta is known to have been a heavy drinker who snorted cocaine. Local newspapers reported how in February 2001, along with Keller, he went on a three-day binge of drinking and drug taking in Key West. [58] ** Just days before 9/11, Atta and Marwan al-Shehhi (another of the alleged suicide-pilots) spent the evening drinking heavily at a bar in Fort Lauderdale. The bar's manager later [told reporters](http://www.sfgate.com/news/article/Agents-of-terror-leave-their-mark-on-Sin-City-2873407.php) that the men \"got wasted,\" drinking \"Stolichnaya and orange juice, and Captain Morgan's spiced rum and Coke.\" Bartender Patricia Idrissi concurred, saying: \"Atta drank Stoli vodka for three straight hours.... They were wasted.\" [59] Amanda Keller describes a typical night out at a club with Atta: \"Marwan [al-Shehhi] was in the reggae room drinking with a bunch of women at the bar, there were a lot of women around him, and he was just flaunting money.\" As Hopsicker points out: \"It's one thing to hear Atta described as living it up with wine, women and song. But Marwan flaunting money at the bar pretty much puts the lie to the 'Islamic fundamentalist' tag.\" [60] Hopsicker suggests that, rather than being a fundamentalist Muslim, Mohamed Atta better fits the profile of a member of Arab society's privileged elite and also a spy. Amongst many oddities contradicting the 'fundamentalist' label is the fact that his e-mail list included the names of several employees of U.S. defense contractors. [61] More alarming, he and as many as six of the other alleged 9/11 hijackers appear to have [trained at U.S. military bases](http://www.newsweek.com/2001/09/14/alleged-hijackers-may-have-trained-at-u-s-bases.html). Hopsicker writes: **\"On the Saturday following the Tuesday attack, the Los Angeles Times [broke the story](https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-2001-sep-15-mn-46069-story.html) in a long article on their front page.

Two others, Hamza Alghamdi and Ahmed Alnami, have names similar to individuals listed in public records as using the same address inside the base,\" the [Washington Post reported](https://www.WantToKnow.info/010916post). \"In addition, a man named Saeed Alghamdi graduated from the Defense Language Institute at Lackland Air Force Base in San Antonio, while men with the same names as two other hijackers, Mohamed Atta and Abdulaziz Alomari, appear as graduates of the U.S. International Officers School at Maxwell Air Force Base, Alabama, and the Aerospace Medical School at Brooks Air Force Base in San Antonio, respectively,\" the Post said. [62] [Newsweek detailed](http://www.newsweek.com/2001/09/14/alleged-hijackers-may-have-trained-at-u-s-bases.html) how U.S. Military facilities routinely trained pilots for other countries: \"A former Navy pilot told NEWSWEEK that during his years on the base, 'we always, always, always trained other countries' pilots.... Whoever the country du jour is, that's whose pilots we train.' Candidates begin with 'an officer's equivalent of boot camp,' he said. 'Then they would put them through flight training.'\" [63] Hopsicker explains how this crucial story came to be dismissed: \"Someone was going to have to answer ... for a lot.\" \"But Atta is a fairly common surname in the Middle East,\" the Post quoted Laila Alquatami of the Arab-American Anti-Discrimination Committee as saying, and the suspected hijacker's first name is \"probably the No. 1 name that is given to babies, in honor of the prophet Mohamed.\" The Boston Globe reported the Pentagon's denial: \"Some of the FBI suspects had names similar to those used by foreign alumni of U.S. Military courses,\" said the Air Force in a statement. \"Discrepancies in their biographical data ... indicate we are probably not talking about the same people.\" How easy was it to tell the Pentagon was lying? Think about it. It is neither plausible nor logical that the reports were false because of seven separate cases of mistaken identity. One or two, maybe. But seven? [64] **None of the newspapers retracted the story, yet it disappeared. One person who sought answers was Senator Bill Nelson, who faxed Attorney General John Ashcroft, demanding to know if the story was really true. However: ** **\"The Senator has still not received a reply, we heard from his spokesman, when we called his office eleven months later.

Their response to date has been that they are trying to sort through something complicated and difficult.\" [65] Deciding to investigate for himself, Hopsicker phoned the Pentagon and spoke with the public information officer who helped write and disseminate their original denial of the story: \"Biographically, they're not the same people,\" she explained patiently, using the same language contained in the Air Force's press release. \"Some of the ages are twenty years off.\" ... Was she saying that the age of the 'Mohamed Atta' who had attended the Air Force's International Officer's School at Maxwell Air Force Base was different than that of 'terrorist ringleader Mohamed Atta?' Not exactly, she admitted. She could not confirm that -- in this specific instance -- they had different ages. What she could do was once again deny that the International Officer's School attendee named Mohamed Atta had been the Mohamed Atta who piloted a passenger plane into the World Trade Center. However, she could offer no specifics for her assertion, and repeatedly declined requests for biographical details about the Mohamed Atta who had trained at Maxwell Air Force Base. [66] After Hopsicker's persistent questioning, she finally said in exasperation: \"I do not have the authority to tell you who attended which schools.\" Hopsicker reflects: \"It was hard to read this as anything other than a back-handed confirmation. When she said that she didn't have the authority, the clear implication was that someone else does... Somewhere in the Defense Dept. a list exists with the names of Sept. 11 terrorists who received training at U.S. Military facilities. She just didn't have the authority to release it.\" [67] Furthermore, Hopsicker spoke to a woman who works at the Maxwell Air Force Base in Alabama: \"I have a girlfriend who recognized Mohamed Atta. She met him at a party at the Officer's Club,\" she told us. \"The reason she swears it was him here is because she didn't just meet him and say hello. After she met him she went around and introduced him to the people that were with her.

They had to get all of them out of here. \"They were all gone the day after the attack.\" [68] **Despite it being a key 9/11 crime scene, there has been a surprising absence of investigations into the goings on in Venice, Florida. In fact, to the contrary, \"the FBI's full attention seemed to have been engaged -- not in investigating what had happened -- but in suppressing evidence and even intimidating the witnesses who had seen and heard things that fly in the face of the 'official story.'\" [69] ** **For example, Mohamed Atta's former girlfriend Amanda Keller says that even after she left Venice, the FBI called on her every other day for several months, telling her not to talk to anybody. Similarly, a woman called Stephanie Frederickson who lived next-door to Atta and Keller in Venice reported how she and other residents at the same apartment building were harassed and intimidated by FBI agents, to prevent them from talking to reporters.** According to Frederickson: \"The question [the FBI] asked was always the same. You aren't saying anything to anybody, are you? At first, right after the attack, they told me I must have been mistaken in my identification. Or they would insinuate that I was lying. Finally they stopped trying to get me to change my story, and just stopped by once a week to make sure I hadn't been talking to anyone. [70] **What is more, the FBI arrived in Venice just hours after the 9/11 attacks. A former manager from Huffman Aviation said: \"They were outside my house four hours after the attack.\" He added: \"My phones have been bugged, they still are.... How did the FBI get here so soon? Ask yourself: How'd they got here so soon?\" [71]** Within 24 hours of the attacks, records from Huffman Aviation, where Atta and al-Shehhi attended, were escorted aboard a C-130 cargo plane to Washington by Florida governor and brother of the president Jeb Bush. Similarly, according to a sergeant with the Venice police, the FBI took all their files and flew them to Washington with Jeb Bush aboard. (Presumably this was on the same flight as the Huffman records.) Hopsicker notes: \"The important point was that taking files was a lot different than copying them. The FBI wasn't", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:050726scandal911.txt:15:6056beea6dfa", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 7425, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "050726scandal911.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "050726scandal911", "chunk_index": 16, "text": "Huffman Aviation, where Atta and al-Shehhi attended, were escorted aboard a C-130 cargo plane to Washington by Florida governor and brother of the president Jeb Bush.

The FBI wasn't taking any chances.\" [72] He concludes: \"There is a demonstrable, provable, and massive federally-supervised cover-up in place in Florida.\" [73] **As this and my previous evidence shows, there are countless unanswered questions about 9/11 that at some point are going to have to be properly examined. Even an investigation into just a few of these questions, such as those around [the war games on 9/11](https://www.WantToKnow.info/050317wargames911), could be enough to start a major scandal. **However, as numerous writers and independent researchers have found, there are so many suspicious circumstances that the truth could be very different to what we have been led to believe. ** Human rights lawyer Richard Falk has written: \"There are so many gaping holes in the official accounts of 9/11 that no plausible coherent narrative remains, and until now we have been staggering forward as if the truth about these traumatic events no longer mattered.\" [74] But if the mainstream press start investigating properly, it could lead to a completely unprecedented '9/11 scandal.'** **PSYCHOHISTORICAL REASONS BEHIND 9/11 AND ENSUING WARS** There are in fact specific psychohistorical reasons I have identified why there could be a major 9/11 scandal in the future. I detail some of these in [my previous article](http://psycnet.apa.org/psycinfo/2004-16371-001), \"Killer Women Group-Fantasies and the 9/11 Controversy,\" in which I examined signs of the current public mood in Britain and America. [75] My evidence suggested both countries are in a state of particularly high anxiety and will need some kind of large crisis to make us all feel better. But with no new 'external enemy' having been found, I suggested we might instead be veering towards 'regicidal solution' -- where we somehow 'sacrifice' our own leaders. But what is the cause of the current public anxiety? And why have our leaders been unable to find a new 'external enemy' to invade? **[Lloyd deMause](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lloyd_deMause) describes how wars have generally occurred after periods of increased prosperity and social progress, especially when accompanied by more personal freedom.

Yet no one seems to have noticed that feelings of sinfulness are usually prominent in the shared emotional life of nations after long periods of peace, prosperity, and social progress, particularly if they are accompanied by more personal and sexual freedom.\" [76] As deMause points out: \"wars between great powers occur during periods of economic expansion, while stagnation hinders their outbreak.\" [77] Furthermore, \"Wars not only occurred far more frequently after prosperous periods, but were longer and bigger after prosperity, 'six to twenty times bigger as indicated by battle fatalities.\" [78] DeMause has found recurrent images of guilt and poison blood in the media, following periods of prosperity and progress. **The progress and increased wealth are felt to have \"polluted the national bloodstream with sinful excess, making men 'soft' and 'feminine,' a frightful condition that can only be cleansed by a blood-shedding purification.\"** [79] DeMause continues: \"Wars have often been thought of as purifying the nation's polluted blood by virtue of a sacrificial rite identical to the rites of human sacrifice so common in early historical periods, when the blood of those sacrificed was believed to renew all the people. War, said those preparing for the bloody Finnish Civil War, purges guilt-producing material prosperity through the blood of soldiers sacrificed on the battlefield.\" [80] So, in the case of the 1991 Gulf War, once it was over: \"The sacrificial ritual had been carried out. The nation had been cleansed of its emotional pollution. The President's popularity rating rose to 91 percent, the highest of any American leader in history. The stock market soared. The country had been united by slaughter as it had never been by any positive achievement. We felt cleansed, purified, as though we had been reborn.\" [81] **To summarize then, periods of growth and prosperity cause much discomfort to many people: feelings of guilt, sinfulness, being 'soft' or 'feminine,' etc. And one way that nations frequently relieve these unpleasant feelings is by going to war.** The 1990s and the beginning of the new millennium certainly rank as a period of prosperity and change. Along with increasing wealth and social change, we have experienced a technological revolution, with cheaper and increasingly powerful home computers, DVD players, digital cameras, and many other previously unavailable gadgets. One writer recently concluded: \"We live in the freest, happiest, least bigoted, healthiest, most peaceful and longest-lived era in human history... [W]e are richer and have the power to alter and control our environment in ways that would have seemed like magic 200 years ago.\" [82] Considering deMause's observations about", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:050726scandal911.txt:17:dd2308e496be", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 7427, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "050726scandal911.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "050726scandal911", "chunk_index": 18, "text": "Along with increasing wealth and social change, we have experienced a technological revolution, with cheaper and increasingly powerful home computers, DVD players, digital cameras, and many other previously unavailable gadgets.

[W]e are richer and have the power to alter and control our environment in ways that would have seemed like magic 200 years ago.\" [82] Considering deMause's observations about wars correlating with change and economic growth, it seems the conditions have been right for a particularly large war to occur. Although we have had recent wars in Afghanistan (2001) and Iraq (2003), these have been small in comparison to some key wars of the 20th century. For example, the Vietnam War lasted many years, from the 1960s through to the early 70s. During this conflict, the U.S. used weapons of mass destruction, spraying South Vietnam with a deadly chemical called 'Agent Orange,' which causes fetal death, congenital defects and cancer. [83] Several *million* Southeast Asians were killed, along with around 58,000 American soldiers. The recent attacks on Afghanistan and Iraq pale in comparison. So surely we'll need a bigger war than either of these, considering all the prosperity and change of the last decade. However, as I said at the start of this article,** following the 2003 Iraq invasion attempts by Britain and America to find a new, more formidable enemy to attack have so far failed.** ** I believe the reason for this is because there are now larger than ever numbers of people opposing war. This in turn, I believe, is thanks to improvements in childrearing during the latter half of the 20th century.** ** For years, psychohistorians have observed a steady evolution in childrearing that is now more rapid than ever before. **Lloyd deMause writes: \"Progress in childrearing evolution may be extremely uneven, but the trends are nonetheless unmistakable. The overall direction is from projection to empathy, from discipline to self-regulation, from hitting to explaining, from incest to love, from rejection to overcontrol and then to independence... Just the sheer cost of raising a child in dollars has been going up. The families I know in my section of Manhattan easily devote over half of their spare time and half their income to their children. Compare this to the small fraction of parents' time and money given over to children in earlier centuries with children even spending most of their lives working for adults in various ways and one can begin to comprehend the overall direction of childrearing evolution.\" [84] Similarly, in 1998 psychohistorian Robert McFarland wrote: **\"Improvements in parenting practices can now be measured in decades rather than in centuries. Since Sweden banned hitting children in 1979, Norway, Finland, Denmark, and Austria have followed.\" [85] And whereas in 1992 over 90 per cent of American", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:050726scandal911.txt:18:da9dc53f0092", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 7428, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "050726scandal911.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "050726scandal911", "chunk_index": 19, "text": "given over to children in earlier centuries with children even spending most of their lives working for adults in various ways and one can begin to comprehend the overall direction of childrearing evolution.\" [84] Similarly, in 1998 psychohistorian Robert McFarland wrote: **\"Improvements in parenting practices can now be measured in decades rather than in centuries. Since Sweden banned hitting children in 1979, Norway, Finland, Denmark, and Austria have followed.\" [85] And whereas in 1992 over 90 per cent of American parents hit their young children, by 1999 this had dropped to 57 per cent.** [86] Due to this steady 'evolution of childhood,' the average level of childrearing experienced by today's young adults in developed countries will have been better than that experienced by previous generations. **Consequently there are now more and more people in the higher 'psychoclasses': **individuals who, due to their more loving childhoods, have a higher level of psychological health. These individuals will be more able to enjoy their increased prosperity and the new technology that has become available over recent years, along with any increased personal freedoms. **As a result, they will have less, if any, desire for war.** This relationship between childhood experience and support for, or opposition to war, has been found by, amongst others, political psychologist Michael Milburn. Milburn says: \"We found that, particularly for males who had never had any psychotherapy,** when they reported a high level of childhood punishment, they were significantly more likely to endorse a range of punitive public policies like ... support for the use of military force**... [T]he higher level of punitiveness among political conservatives is really strongly associated with experiences, generally, of harsh punishment from childhood. It's not just going to be that they were spanked; there's a whole family climate, and punishment is just going to be one of those indicators of that.\" [87] If a person who experiences a severe and punitive childhood is likely to grow up into the kind of adult who favours the use of military force, we might logically assume the opposite is true: Individuals who had better childhoods will be less supportive of wars. Lloyd deMause confirms this, describing his observations of young adults today who have experienced far more loving childhoods: \"[These individuals] are far more empathic and therefore more concerned about others than we ever were, and this has made them far more activist in their lives in trying to make a difference and change the world for the better, mostly involving themselves in local activities rather than global political changes. They lack all need for nationalism, wars, and other grandiose projects, and in the organizations they start are genuinely nonauthoritarian. ** There is no question that if the world could treat children with helping-mode parenting, wars and other self-destructive social conditions we still suffer from in the twenty-first century will be cured**.\" [88] With the gradual improvement", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:050726scandal911.txt:19:891fd0f830df", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 7429, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "050726scandal911.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "050726scandal911", "chunk_index": 20, "text": "trying to make a difference and change the world for the better, mostly involving themselves in local activities rather than global political changes.

This was clearly evidenced by the unprecedented level of opposition to the 2003 Iraq invasion. In London, for example, on Saturday February 15, 2003, an estimated one to [two million people](http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2003/sep/26/politics.antiwar) marched in protest against the imminent invasion: the largest public demonstration ever to occur in Britain. The following month, 400,000 marched through London, the biggest protest in Britain against a war during wartime. [89] Weeks before the war started, Tony Blair suffered the biggest Commons revolt of his premiership when 199 MPs rejected his direction over Iraq. As the leader of the Liberal Democrats, [Charles Kennedy, observed](http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2003/feb/26/foreignpolicy.uk2): \"Despite investing masses of political and parliamentary capital, the government has still failed to persuade a third of the House of Commons.\" [90] According to leading political scholar and critic of American foreign policy [Noam Chomsky](http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2003/feb/04/interviews.iraq), in an interview around this time: \"There's never been a time that I can think of when there's been such massive opposition to a war before it was even started... Even in the United States there is overwhelming opposition to the war and the corresponding decline in the leadership that is driving the war.\" [91] Chomsky points out how **even our governments are aware of this new reluctance towards war and have had to modify their actions accordingly**:** \"[W]hen any administration comes into office the first thing it does is have a worldwide intelligence assessment -- 'What's the state of the world?' -- provided by the intelligence services...** When the first Bush administration came in 1989, parts of their intelligence assessment were leaked, and they're very revealing about what happened in the subsequent 10 years about precisely these questions. **The parts that were leaked said that it was about military confrontations with much weaker enemies, recognising they were the only kind we were going to be willing to face, or even exist. So in confrontations with much weaker enemies the United States must win 'decisively and rapidly' because otherwise popular support will erode, because it's understood to be very thin.** Not like the 1960s when the government could fight a long, brutal war for years and years practically destroying a country without any protest. Not now.\" [92] Although the peace movement failed to prevent the Iraq invasion, when the war began it", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:050726scandal911.txt:20:486c5ffd008c", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 7430, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "050726scandal911.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "050726scandal911", "chunk_index": 21, "text": "were going to be willing to face, or even exist.

Not now.\" [92] Although the peace movement failed to prevent the Iraq invasion, when the war began it seemed they had made a significant difference. As [Jonathan Freedland wrote](http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2003/mar/22/iraq.antiwar) in *The Guardian*: \"The campaign began not with 'shock and awe' but a subtler knife, aimed at the surgical decapitation of Saddam Hussein and his regime. One night's bombing of Baghdad lasted no more than an hour... There could be a stack of explanations for that initial deployment of the short, sharp blow... But there may be another motive for the initial preference for short-and-sweet over shock-and-awe. The US might have wanted to avoid a wave of worldwide revulsion. A series of tight, well-aimed strikes at the regime would have confounded the global fear of colossal Iraqi civilian casualties. It's as if Washington had heard the peace movement's objection to this war--that too many innocents would die--and was attempting to heed it.\" [93] Freedland continues: \"[P]erhaps the clearest proof of the anti-war camp's efforts came from our own prime minister: 'I know this course of action has produced deep divisions of opinion in our country,' he said, just seconds into his own TV message to the nation. No leader wants to go into a war admitting such a thing. But Blair had no choice. As with much else, the peace movement has changed the landscape for this conflict--and the men of war are having to deal with it.\" [94] What peace activists may well have achieved is the prevention of further invasions of 'axis of evil' countries. As Lindsey German of the Stop the War Coalition said, \"does anyone think Tony Blair can ever stand up in parliament again and say the words, 'trust me'? As they talk up targeting Iran and Syria, do you think anyone will ever believe this government when they say we've got the intelligence to prove it?\" [95] **Maybe the improvements in childrearing over recent decades that account for this unprecedented opposition to war, will also mean there are now enough people less afraid to challenge authority and face unpleasant truths, so as to help bring about a 9/11 scandal.** Compare this to, say, the truth about the attack on Pearl Harbor in December 1941. We now know that President Franklin Roosevelt and his top military advisers knew in advance that Japan was planning a 'surprise attack' on America. Japanese radio messages had been intercepted and it was known when and where they would attack the U.S. Despite this foreknowledge, Roosevelt allowed the attack", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:050726scandal911.txt:21:4dab50485033", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 7431, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "050726scandal911.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "050726scandal911", "chunk_index": 22, "text": "to challenge authority and face unpleasant truths, so as to help bring about a 9/11 scandal.** Compare this to, say, the truth about the attack on Pearl Harbor in December 1941. We now know that President Franklin Roosevelt and his top military advisers knew in advance that Japan was planning a 'surprise attack' on America. Japanese radio messages had been intercepted and it was known when and where they would attack the U.S. Despite this foreknowledge, Roosevelt allowed the attack to go ahead so as to create a pretext for America to join World War II. Yet these facts only became more widely known in 2000, with the release of Robert B. Stinnett's book *Day of Deceit: The Truth About FDR and Pearl Harbor*. [96] Robert McFarland points out: \"While it was 58 years before Stinnett's book made the facts about Pearl Harbor widely known, two important books about 9/11 came out within a year... Since these books came out quickly, we are apparently more willing to look at bad news than we were in 1941.\" [97] While a 9/11 scandal would be a sufficiently large public crisis to help ease the particularly high level of public anxiety ('growth panic') among the lower psychoclasses, unlike a massive war it ought also be acceptable to the more peaceful higher psychoclass individuals. If we do have such a scandal, the emotional effect will undoubtedly be intense. Consider how the general public would feel if people start openly accusing some within the Bush administration of complicity in the 9/11 attacks. How would Americans feel who had voted for these men, trusted and respected them? I can imagine many people finding such events devastating. **What if security camera footage of the attack on the Pentagon had to be made public at some point and it showed something *other than* a Boeing 757 hitting the Pentagon? [98] Surely millions of people would feel horrified. The full implications of a 9/11 scandal would be colossal. It would be the *emotional equivalent* of a massive war. So maybe instead of the war \"of a force and scope and scale that has been beyond what has been seen before,\" that Donald Rumsfeld promised back in 2003, there is going to be a scandal of a \"scope and scale\" that is \"beyond what has been seen before.\"** **Important note:** Don't miss the \"[What you can do](#what)\" section at the end of the footnotes below.

Though the means may vary, the intent behind the means is quite narrowly defined as the intent to expand into a state of integration whereby all aspects of your conscious self become increasingly aligned with your divine essence. There are three particular life principles that help to align your perspective with the perspective of divine essence and thus inspire profound personal transformation. They are: 1) seeing the Divine in all; 2) nurturance of life; and 3) gratitude. When you apply these principles, a deeper meaning will be revealed to the seemingly random events of your life experience. This is the principle that the Divine is present and can be seen everywhere and in all manifestations of life. It is interwoven in all things like an intricate mosaic whose pieces adhere to the same wall, and are thus unified. However, it is not the picture that unifies the mosaic, but the wall upon which its pieces adhere. Similarly, the Divine paints a picture so diverse and seemingly unrelated that there appears to be no unification. Yet it is not the outward manifestations that unify. It is the inward center of divine energy that unifies all life. Seeing the Divine in all is the principle that all manifestations of life convey an expression of All That Is. It does not matter how far the unifying energy has been distorted; the Divine can be observed. It is the action of perceiving unification even when the outward manifestations appear random, distorted, or chaotic. The principle of seeing the Divine in all is the perception that life is perfect in its expression because it flows from perfection, and that no", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:050809profoundspiritualwriting.txt:0:bf955be308de", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 7441, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "050809profoundspiritualwriting.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "050809profoundspiritualwriting", "chunk_index": 1, "text": "Seeing the Divine in all is the principle that all manifestations of life convey an expression of All That Is. It does not matter how far the unifying energy has been distorted; the Divine can be observed. It is the action of perceiving unification even when the outward manifestations appear random, distorted, or chaotic. The principle of seeing the Divine in all is the perception that life is perfect in its expression because it flows from perfection, and that no matter how divergent its manifestations are, all life is an extension of the Divine. In light of the obvious turmoil and destruction that are apparent on Earth, this is an outlook or perception that may seem naive. How can life in all its forms and expressions be perceived as optimal or perfect? This is the great paradox of life, and it cannot be reconciled with your mental or emotional capabilities. It can only be understood in the context of the soul, which is deathless, timeless, limitless, and sovereign. Calling forth the divine perceptions of the soul is actualized through looking for both the inward and outward manifestations of the Divine. It is not only that the Divine is found within you and within every individual manifestation of life; it is also in itself the wholeness of all life. Thus, this principle of transformation calls for seeing the Divine in all its diverse forms of manifestation, as well as in the wholeness of life itself. Life, in this definition, is an individual's sovereign reality. It is subjective and impressionable. Life is the wholeness of experience flowing past the individual's field of perception in the present moment. Nurturance of life is the principle whereby an individual is in alignment with the natural expansion of intelligence inherent within all life. This alignment enhances the life energy that flows past the individual with the clear intent of gentle support. It is the action of opening to the highest motive in all people and in all life and supporting the flow of this highest intention towards its ultimate expression. In so doing, the action is performed without judgment, analysis, or attachment to outcome. It involves simply nurturing the highest energy that flows from all people and all beings, and thus supporting their fullest expression of life. This is a departure from the normal perception that nurturing support can only be granted when others are in alignment with your personal will and desires. When, instead, you view everything in your life as an integrated energy flowing as an expression of ever-expanding divine intelligence, all life is honored as an extension of the Divine. All people and all forms of life can be nurtured and supported to their highest expression. Energy is an element of life that is so subtly interwoven with form that it is one, in much the same manner as space and time are", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:050809profoundspiritualwriting.txt:1:0840766197b0", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 7442, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "050809profoundspiritualwriting.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "050809profoundspiritualwriting", "chunk_index": 2, "text": "alignment with your personal will and desires.

All people and all forms of life can be nurtured and supported to their highest expression. Energy is an element of life that is so subtly interwoven with form that it is one, in much the same manner as space and time are inextricably linked in union. Life energy is always in a state of becoming. It is never static or regressive in its natural state. You are very capable of nurturing this natural expansion of energy to forge new channels of expression and experience. There are many specific actions that can be taken to nurture life. Each soul can transform energy through a tremendous variety of means. Working through your body, your soul is able to collect and store energy and redirect its purpose or application. This transformation of energy can occur on both personal and universal levels of expression. That is, within an individual's field of awareness, energy can be transformed to conform to a vision of personal welfare, or aligned with a vision of universal welfare and goodwill. One of the best methods to transform energy is through exploring one's belief system. All beliefs have energy systems that act like birthing chambers for the manifestation of beliefs. Within these energy systems are currents that direct life experience. Your soul is aware of these currents either consciously or unconsciously and allows them to carry you into the realm of experience that exemplifies your core belief system. By cultivating beliefs that expand and transform energy, you are able to engage energy systems that are nurturing to life in all its myriad forms. When your beliefs are clearly defined as intentions, your life energy engages fully in the present moment. [Clarity of intention](https://www.weboflove.org/lifepurposeintentions) is essential to engaging the energy system of your core beliefs, and to allowing the nurturance of life to prevail in all activities. **Gratitude** If you are aware-or at least interested in having the awareness-of how perfectly the Divine supports your sovereign reality, there is a powerful and natural sense of gratitude that flows from you to the Divine. It is this wellspring of gratitude that opens the channel of support from the Divine to the individual and establishes a collaboration of purpose to transform the individual soul into a pure expression of divine essence. It is principally gratitude that opens you to connection and alignment with your divine essence. When you project gratitude, regardless of circumstance or condition, life becomes increasingly supportive. This feeling of gratitude coupled with the mental concept of appreciation is expressed like an invisible message in all directions and at all times. Gratitude is an essential facet of love that opens you to redefine your", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:050809profoundspiritualwriting.txt:2:be1adc0f48a1", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 7443, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "050809profoundspiritualwriting.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "050809profoundspiritualwriting", "chunk_index": 3, "text": "collaboration of purpose to transform the individual soul into a pure expression of divine essence. It is principally gratitude that opens you to connection and alignment with your divine essence. When you project gratitude, regardless of circumstance or condition, life becomes increasingly supportive. This feeling of gratitude coupled with the mental concept of appreciation is expressed like an invisible message in all directions and at all times. Gratitude is an essential facet of love that opens you to redefine your purpose as a supportive extension of the Divine, rather than the whimsical outreach of fate or the exacting reaction of a mechanical, detached universe. Establishing a relationship with the universe through the outflow of gratitude also attracts life experience that is deeply transformative-experience that is richly devoted to uncovering life's deepest meaning and most formative purpose. When you are aligned with divine essence and live from this perspective as part of an ever-unfolding reality, you attract a natural state of harmony. This does not mean that your life is without problems or discomforts; rather it signifies a perception that there is an integral purpose in what life reveals. Natural harmony perceives that life experience is meaningful to the extent that you are aligned with your divine essence. When your personal reality flows in alignment with divine essence, you create lasting joy and inner peace. It is the perspective of divine essence that all life is pure love in its fullest expression, and that in this single concept, all life is conceived and forever exists. This becomes the core belief from which all other beliefs arise. And as these beliefs expand outward, this core belief system emerges with a clear intent of supporting a fundamental perspective of seeing, nurturing, and appreciating the universe as the divine cradle from which all life is created and evolves. These life principles are merely symbols represented in words and served to you as a potential recipe to stir awake the embers of light that tirelessly burn within. There are no specific techniques or rituals that are required to invoke their power. They are simply perspectives. In a real sense, they are intentions that attract experience that expands consciousness. They do not provide quick fixes or instant realizations. They are amplifiers of personal will and intention that clarify how one lives. Their profound transformative power is contained exclusively in the intent of their application. Through these principles of transformation, you can become a master of empowering your deeper self. If you apply these life principles with clear intent, you have the tools to accelerate the emergence of divine essence. You can awaken the perspective, insights, and empowered abilities of your divine essence to create new realms of possibility and shape them as learning adventures that expand and transform your consciousness. This is the underlying purpose of these principles, and perhaps the best reason to explore them.", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:050809profoundspiritualwriting.txt:3:611fd59adf94", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 7444, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "050809profoundspiritualwriting.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "050809profoundspiritualwriting", "chunk_index": 4, "text": "principles of transformation, you can become a master of empowering your deeper self.

These and other \"non-lethal weapons,\" as they are called, have been around for decades. See a brief summary of the history and development of non-lethal weapons with footnotes for verification at [this link](https://www.WantToKnow.info/mindcontrol10pg#nonlethal). We spend immense amounts of money each year on weapons and the military. **Yet CBS reports that the Pentagon's own auditors were [unable to account for $2.3 trillion](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/the-war-on-waste/) of the military budget**. That's almost $10,000 for every man, woman and child in the US which has disappeared from the accounting books. A highly decorated US general once wrote a devastating book exposing exactly how [*War is a Racket*](https://www.WantToKnow.info/warcoverup) which pads the pockets of the power elite.

''Directed-energy'' pulses can be throttled up or down depending on the situation, much like the phasers on ''Star Trek'' could be set to kill or merely stun.** Such weapons are now nearing fruition.

But logistical issues have delayed their battlefield debut -- even as soldiers in Iraq encounter tense urban situations in which the nonlethal capabilities of directed energy could be put to the test. \"It's a great technology with enormous potential, but I think the environment's not strong for it,\" said James Jay Carafano, a senior fellow at the conservative Heritage Foundation who blames the military and Congress for not spending enough on getting directed energy to the front. \"The tragedy is that I think it's exactly the right time for this.\" **The hallmark of all directed-energy weapons is that the target -- whether a human or a mechanical object -- has no chance to avoid the shot because it moves at the speed of light. At some frequencies, it can penetrate walls. ** Since the ammunition is merely light or radio waves, directed-energy weapons are limited only by the supply of electricity. And they don't involve chemicals or projectiles that can be inaccurate, accidentally cause injury or violate international treaties. **\"When you're dealing with people whose full intent is to die, you can't give people a choice of whether to comply,\" said George Gibbs, a systems engineer for the Marine Expeditionary Rifle Squad Program who oversees directed-energy projects. \"What I'm looking for is a way to shoot everybody, and they're all OK.\" ** Almost as diverse as the electromagnetic spectrum itself, directed-energy weapons span a wide range of incarnations. **Among the simplest forms are inexpensive, handheld lasers that fill people's field of vision, inducing a temporary blindness to ensure they stop at a checkpoint, for example. Some of these already are used in Iraq. ** Other radio-frequency weapons in development can sabotage the electronics of land mines, shoulder-fired missiles or automobiles -- a prospect that interests police departments in addition to the military. **A separate branch of directed-energy research involves bigger, badder beams: lasers that could obliterate targets tens of miles away from ships or planes. Such a strike would be so surgical that, as some designers put it at a recent conference here, the military could plausibly deny responsibility. ** The flexibility of directed-energy weapons could be vital as wide-scale, force-on-force conflict becomes increasingly rare, many experts say. But the technology has been slowed by such practical concerns as how to shrink beam-firing antennas and power supplies. Military officials also say more needs to be done to assure the international community that directed-energy weapons set to stun rather than kill will not harm noncombatants. **Such issues recently led the Pentagon to delay its Project Sheriff, a plan to outfit vehicles in Iraq with a combination of lethal and nonlethal weaponry -- including a highly touted microwave-energy blaster that makes", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:050812electromagneticbeamweapons.txt:1:17ee75e413b4", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 7447, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "050812electromagneticbeamweapons.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "050812electromagneticbeamweapons", "chunk_index": 2, "text": "the technology has been slowed by such practical concerns as how to shrink beam-firing antennas and power supplies.

Sheriff has been pushed at least to 2006. ** \"It was best to step back and make sure we understand where we can go with it,\" said David Law, science and technology chief for the Joint Non-Lethal Weapons Directorate. **The directed-energy component in the project is the Active Denial System, developed by Air Force researchers and built by Raytheon Co. It produces a millimeter-wavelength burst of energy that penetrates 1/64 of an inch into a person's skin, agitating water molecules to produce heat. The sensation is certain to get people to halt whatever they are doing. ** Military investigators say decades of research have shown that the effect ends the moment a person is out of the beam, and no lasting damage is done as long as the stream does not exceed a certain duration. How long? That answer is classified, but it apparently is in the realm of seconds, not minutes. The range of the beam also is secret, though it is said to be further than small arms fire, so an attacker could be repelled before he could pull a trigger. Although Active Denial works -- after a $51 million, 11-year investment -- it has proven to be a \"model for how hard it is to field a directed-energy nonlethal weapon,\" Law said. For example, the prototype system can be mounted on a Humvee but the vehicle has to stop in order to fire the beam. Using the vehicle's electrical power \"is pushing its limits,\" he added. Still, Raytheon is pressing ahead with smaller, portable, shorter-range spinoffs of Active Denial for embassies, ships or other sensitive spots. One potential customer is the Department of Energy. Researchers at its Sandia National Laboratories are testing Active Denial as a way to repel intruders from nuclear facilities. But Sandia researchers say the beams won't be in place until 2008 at the earliest because so much testing remains. In the meantime, Raytheon is trying to drum up business for an automated airport-defense project known as Vigilant Eagle that detects shoulder-fired missiles and fries their electronics with an electromagnetic wave. The system, which would cost $25 million per airport, has proven effective against a \"real threat,\" said Michael Booen, a former Air Force colonel who heads Raytheon's directed-energy work. He refused to elaborate.

He refused to elaborate. For Peter Bitar, the future of directed energy boils down to money. Bitar heads Indiana-based Xtreme Alternative Defense Systems Ltd., which makes small blinding lasers used in Iraq. But his real project is a nonlethal energy device called the StunStrike. Basically, it fires a bolt of lightning. It can be tuned to blow up explosives, possibly to stop vehicles and certainly to buzz people. The strike can be made to feel as gentle as \"broom bristles\" or cranked up to deliver a paralyzing jolt that \"takes a few minutes to wear off.\" Bitar, who is of Arab descent, believes StunStrike would be particularly intimidating in the Middle East because, he contends, people there are especially afraid of lightning. At present, StunStrike is a 20-foot tower that can zap things up to 28 feet away. The next step is to shrink it so it could be wielded by troops and used in civilian locales like airplane cabins or building entrances. Xtreme ADS also needs more tests to establish that StunStrike is safe to use on people. But all that takes money -- more than the $700,000 Bitar got from the Pentagon from 2003 until the contract recently ended. Bitar is optimistic StunStrike will be perfected, either with revenue from the laser pointers or a partnership with a bigger defense contractor. In the meantime, though, he wishes soldiers in Iraq already had his lightning device on difficult missions like door-to-door searches. \"It's very frustrating when you know you've got a solution that's being ignored,\" he said. \"The technology is the easy part.\" Joint Non-Lethal Weapons Directorate: [https://www.jnlwd.usmc.mil](https://www.jnlwd.usmc.mil) Read the [original article](http://msnbc.msn.com/id/8516353/) on electromagnetic pulse beam weapons on the MSNBC website. **What you can do:** Inform your media and political representatives of this important information on electromagnetic weapons and beam weapons.

I never graduated from college. Truth be told, this is the closest I've ever gotten to a college graduation. Today I want to tell you three stories from my life. That's it. No big deal. Just three stories. ** **The first story is about connecting the dots. ** **I dropped out of Reed College after the first 6 months, but then stayed around as a drop-in for another 18 months or so before I really quit.** So why did I drop out? It started before I was born. My biological mother was a young, unwed college graduate student, and she decided to put me up for adoption. She felt very strongly that I should be adopted by college graduates, so everything was all set for me to be adopted at birth by a lawyer and his wife. Except that when I popped out they decided at the last minute that they really wanted a girl. So my parents, who were on a waiting list, got a call in the middle of the night asking: \"We have an unexpected baby boy; do you want him?\" They said: \"Of course.\" My biological mother", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:050828findwhatyoulove.txt:0:0fd5405025e0", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 7454, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "050828findwhatyoulove.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "050828findwhatyoulove", "chunk_index": 1, "text": "that I should be adopted by college graduates, so everything was all set for me to be adopted at birth by a lawyer and his wife. Except that when I popped out they decided at the last minute that they really wanted a girl. So my parents, who were on a waiting list, got a call in the middle of the night asking: \"We have an unexpected baby boy; do you want him?\" They said: \"Of course.\" My biological mother later found out that my mother had never graduated from college and that my father had never graduated from high school. She refused to sign the final adoption papers. She only relented a few months later when my parents promised that I would someday go to college. And 17 years later I did go to college. But I naively chose a college that was almost as expensive as Stanford, and all of my working-class parents' savings were being spent on my college tuition. After six months, I couldn't see the value in it. I had no idea what I wanted to do with my life and no idea how college was going to help me figure it out. And **here I was spending all of the money my parents had saved their entire life. ** **So I decided to drop out and trust that it would all work out OK. It was pretty scary at the time, but looking back it was one of the best decisions I ever made.** The minute I dropped out I could stop taking the required classes that didn't interest me, and begin dropping in on the ones that looked interesting. It wasn't all romantic. I didn't have a dorm room, so I slept on the floor in friends' rooms, I returned Coke bottles for the 5¢ deposits to buy food with, and I would walk the 7 miles across town every Sunday night to get one good meal a week at the Hare Krishna temple. I loved it. And **much of what I stumbled into by following my curiosity and intuition turned out to be priceless later on.** Let me give you one example: Reed College at that time offered perhaps the best calligraphy instruction in the country. Throughout the campus every poster, every label on every drawer, was beautifully hand calligraphed. Because I had dropped out and didn't have to take the normal classes, I decided to take a calligraphy class to learn how to do this. I learned about serif and san serif typefaces, about varying the amount of space between different letter combinations, about what makes great typography great. It was beautiful, historical, artistically subtle in a way that science can't capture, and I found it fascinating. None of this had even a hope of any practical application in my life. But ten years later, when we were designing the first", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:050828findwhatyoulove.txt:1:11f7a4fd1bb6", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 7455, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "050828findwhatyoulove.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "050828findwhatyoulove", "chunk_index": 2, "text": "classes, I decided to take a calligraphy class to learn how to do this.

It was beautiful, historical, artistically subtle in a way that science can't capture, and I found it fascinating. None of this had even a hope of any practical application in my life. But ten years later, when we were designing the first Macintosh computer, it all came back to me. And we designed it all into the Mac. It was the first computer with beautiful typography. If I had never dropped in on that single course in college, the Mac would have never had multiple typefaces or proportionally spaced fonts. And since Windows just copied the Mac, its likely that no personal computer would have them. **If I had never dropped out, I would have never dropped in on this calligraphy class, and personal computers might not have the wonderful typography that they do. **Of course it was impossible to connect the dots looking forward when I was in college. But it was very, very clear looking backwards ten years later. Again, you can't connect the dots looking forward; you can only connect them looking backwards. **So you have to trust that the dots will somehow connect in your future. You have to trust in something - your gut, destiny, life, karma, whatever. **This approach has never let me down, and it has made all the difference in my life. **My second story is about love and loss. ** **I was lucky - I found what I loved to do early in life. Woz and I started Apple in my parents garage when I was 20. We worked hard, and in 10 years Apple had grown from just the two of us in a garage into a $2 billion company with over 4000 employees. We had just released our finest creation - the Macintosh - a year earlier, and I had just turned 30. And then I got fired.** How can you get fired from a company you started? Well, as Apple grew we hired someone who I thought was very talented to run the company with me, and for the first year or so things went well. But then our visions of the future began to diverge and eventually we had a falling out. When we did, our Board of Directors sided with him. So at 30 I was out. And very publicly out. What had been the focus of my entire adult life was gone, and it was devastating. I really didn't know what to do for a few months. I felt that I had let the previous generation of entrepreneurs down - that I had dropped the baton as it was being passed to me. I met with David", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:050828findwhatyoulove.txt:2:5f06efd41f4e", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 7456, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "050828findwhatyoulove.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "050828findwhatyoulove", "chunk_index": 3, "text": "a falling out.

I really didn't know what to do for a few months. I felt that I had let the previous generation of entrepreneurs down - that I had dropped the baton as it was being passed to me. I met with David Packard and Bob Noyce and tried to apologize for screwing up so badly. I was a very public failure, and I even thought about running away from the valley. But something slowly began to dawn on me - I still loved what I did. The turn of events at Apple had not changed that one bit. I had been rejected, but I was still in love. And so I decided to start over. **I didn't see it then, but it turned out that getting fired from Apple was the best thing that could have ever happened to me. **The heaviness of being successful was replaced by the lightness of being a beginner again, less sure about everything. It freed me to enter one of the most creative periods of my life. **During the next five years, I started a company named NeXT, another company named Pixar, and fell in love with an amazing woman who would become my wife. Pixar went on to create the world's first computer animated feature film, Toy Story, and is now the most successful animation studio in the world. **In a remarkable turn of events, Apple bought NeXT, I returned to Apple, and the technology we developed at NeXT is at the heart of Apple's current renaissance. And Laurene and I have a wonderful family together. I'm pretty sure none of this would have happened if I hadn't been fired from Apple. It was awful tasting medicine, but I guess the patient needed it. **Sometimes life hits you in the head with a brick. Don't lose faith. I'm convinced that the only thing that kept me going was that I loved what I did. You've got to find what you love.** And that is as true for your work as it is for your lovers. Your work is going to fill a large part of your life, and the only way to be truly satisfied is to do what you believe is great work. And the only way to do great work is to love what you do. If you haven't found it yet, keep looking. Don't settle. As with all matters of the heart, you'll know when you find it. And, like any great relationship, it just gets better and better as the years roll on. So keep looking until you find it. Don't settle. **My third story is about death. ** **When I", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:050828findwhatyoulove.txt:3:fbe47959f389", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 7457, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "050828findwhatyoulove.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "050828findwhatyoulove", "chunk_index": 4, "text": "is to do what you believe is great work.

Don't settle. **My third story is about death. ** **When I was 17, I read a quote that went something like: \"If you live each day as if it was your last, someday you'll most certainly be right.\" It made an impression on me, and since then, for the past 33 years, I have looked in the mirror every morning and asked myself: \"If today were the last day of my life, would I want to do what I am about to do today?\" And whenever the answer has been \"No\" for too many days in a row, I know I need to change something. ** Remembering that I'll be dead soon is the most important tool I've ever encountered to help me make the big choices in life. Because almost everything - all external expectations, all pride, all fear of embarrassment or failure - these things just fall away in the face of death, leaving only what is truly important. Remembering that you are going to die is the best way I know to avoid the trap of thinking you have something to lose. You are already naked. There is no reason not to follow your heart. About a year ago I was diagnosed with cancer. I had a scan at 7:30 in the morning, and it clearly showed a tumor on my pancreas. I didn't even know what a pancreas was. The doctors told me this was almost certainly a type of cancer that is incurable, and that I should expect to live no longer than three to six months. My doctor advised me to go home and get my affairs in order, which is doctor's code for prepare to die. It means to try to tell your kids everything you thought you'd have the next 10 years to tell them in just a few months. It means to make sure everything is buttoned up so that it will be as easy as possible for your family. It means to say your goodbyes. I lived with that diagnosis all day. Later that evening I had a biopsy, where they stuck an endoscope down my throat, through my stomach and into my intestines, put a needle into my pancreas and got a few cells from the tumor. I was sedated, but my wife, who was there, told me that when they viewed the cells under a microscope the doctors started crying because it turned out to be a very rare", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:050828findwhatyoulove.txt:4:9071d668fca7", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 7458, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "050828findwhatyoulove.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "050828findwhatyoulove", "chunk_index": 5, "text": "to say your goodbyes.

I was sedated, but my wife, who was there, told me that when they viewed the cells under a microscope the doctors started crying because it turned out to be a very rare form of pancreatic cancer that is curable with surgery. I had the surgery and I'm fine now. This was the closest I've been to facing death, and I hope its the closest I get for a few more decades. Having lived through it, I can now say this to you with a bit more certainty than when death was a useful but purely intellectual concept: No one wants to die. Even people who want to go to heaven don't want to die to get there. And yet death is the destination we all share. No one has ever escaped it. And that is as it should be, because Death is very likely the single best invention of Life. It is Life's change agent. It clears out the old to make way for the new. Right now the new is you, but someday not too long from now, you will gradually become the old and be cleared away. Sorry to be so dramatic, but it is quite true. **Your time is limited, so don't waste it living someone else's life. Don't be trapped by dogma - which is living with the results of other people's thinking. Don't let the noise of others' opinions drown out your own inner voice. And most important, have the courage to follow your heart and intuition. They somehow already know what you truly want to become. Everything else is secondary. ** When I was young, there was an amazing publication called The Whole Earth Catalog, which was one of the bibles of my generation. It was created by a fellow named Stewart Brand not far from here in Menlo Park, and he brought it to life with his poetic touch. This was in the late 1960's, before personal computers and desktop publishing, so it was all made with typewriters, scissors, and polaroid cameras. It was sort of like Google in paperback form, 35 years before Google came along: it was idealistic, and overflowing with neat tools and great notions. Stewart and his team put out several issues of The Whole Earth Catalog, and then when it had run its course, they put out a final issue. It was the mid-1970s, and I was your age. On the back cover of their final issue was a photograph of an early morning country road, the kind you might find yourself hitchhiking on if you were so adventurous.

I told him the answer is simple: choose peace. While you cannot control the attitudes or actions of politicians or others, you have total control over the thoughts, feelings, and energy you are exuding. If you are steeped in fear, anger, or a sense of victimization, you are contributing to the darkness. If you hold a sense of peace, compassion, kindness, and the presence of love, you are contributing to healing. As Kipling nobly penned, \"If you can hold your head when all about you are losing theirs...\" Mother Teresa was once asked to speak at an anti-war rally. She refused. \"If it were a pro-peace rally, I would attend,\" she explained. \"But fighting against war, like fighting against anything, is just another form of war.\" A liberal spiritual teacher once recounted that on his altar he has pictures of Christ and many other spiritual masters. He recently added a photo of George W. Bush. Why? \"Until I can find the same divinity in George W. Bush as I find in other holy beings, I am stuck. When I can see and honor his soul, then I am in a position to protest. Until then, I am ineffective.\" The [power of intention](https://www.weboflove.org/lifepurposeintentions) and prayer goes a long, long way. At any given moment the world situation is a precise expression of the consciousness of all the people who live here. As you shift your consciousness in the direction of peace, wholeness, and faith, you tip the balance in that direction. You literally become the tipping point for the world you would like to create. Be less concerned with what you are doing and more concerned with how you are doing it. Actions that spring from fear or hatred, no matter how nobly clothed, create only more of the same. Actions that issue from faith and love, no matter how humbly clothed, create only more of the same. A visionary thrives under all circumstances, for he or she sees beyond the obvious. At this time the world needs good visionaries. If you would save the world, begin with your own consciousness. **The Invitation-**Oriah Mountain Dreamer Available in [her books](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/search-handle-url/index=books&field-author-exact=Oriah%20Mountain%20Dreamer&rank=-relevance%2C%2Bavailability%2C-daterank/104-1977356-6224703?tag=wanttinfo-20) and a [newspaper article](http://www.boulderweekly.com/archive/062404/hygeia.html) It doesn't interest me what you do for a living.

Now we'll go inside some 60 years worth of sensational, controversial reports about people who say they saw UFOs, and those who even claim they were abducted by them. **Investigators on both sides of the UFO question will take your calls. Let's meet our panel in what should be an extraordinary hour. In Denver, is John Schuessler, former engineer for Boeing and NASA who has worked with pilots and astronauts who claim to have seen UFOs. He's director of the Mutual UFO Network and author of a book documenting a disturbing Texas UFO siting. In Boston is Dr. Susan Clancy, skeptical author of an upcoming book, \"Abducted\" about people who claim to have been abducted by aliens. She says memories are not always factual or reliable. Here in Los Angeles is Seth Shostak. He is senior astronomer for the SETI Institute -The Search for Extra-Terrestrial intelligence. In New York is Budd Hopkins, a top researcher into the UFO abduction phenomena, author of \"Sight Unseen, Science, UFO Invisibility and Transgenic Beings.\" In Washington is Rob Swiatek, long-time UFO investigator, researcher since 1968, and a board member of the Fund for UFO Research. And also in Washington is Bruce Maccabee, active in UFO research since the late 1960s. He works with the National Investigations Committee on Aerial Phenomena, and serves on the board of the Fund for UFO Research. John, what got you interested in this whole topic to begin with? JOHN SCHUESSLER, MUTUAL UFO NETWORK [[http://www.mufon.com](http://www.mufon.com)]: **I became interested in the mid '60s during the Gemini IV flight when astronaut James McDivit said that he saw something in orbit. The ground controllers kind of ignored him but he went ahead and took a picture. This was not anything really classic, but as a young engineer it just inspired the heck out of me because we'd worked night and day for several years to get Gemini IV up there.** After that I started talking to pilots and others who I thought were highly credible people, good observers, capable individuals, and I've never stopped since. KING: Dr. Clancy, what aroused your interest?

SETH SHOSTAK, SETI INSTITUTE [[http://www.seti.org](http://www.seti.org)]: Well, the SETI Institute is a non-profit research organization designed to investigate the whole question of life beyond earth. And part of our project is to try and prove that there is extraterrestrial - not only life, but intelligent life out there by eavesdropping on signals. KING: Budd Hopkins in New York, what got you interested? [BUDD HOPKINS](http://www.intrudersfoundation.org/budd_hopkins.html), UFO ABDUCTION RESEARCHER: **I was a complete skeptic. I had no interest in the subject. [Then] I had a daytime UFO sighting in 1964. And a few years later a man I knew quite well told me about a UFO landing that he had observed. He saw figures who disembarked from the craft. Soil samples were taken [from] the remains of the holes in the ground that were dug. This was in New Jersey right across the Hudson River from Manhattan. I looked into it and found a second witness who had seen the whole thing from another perspective and found more physical evidence.** KING: Rob, you're a longtime investigator. What got you involved? [ROB SWIATEK](http://www.aztecufo.com/speakers/robswiatek.htm), UFO INVESTIGATOR: Well, Larry, I was completely intrigued by sightings of these strange objects back in the 1960s. I couldn't believe that seemingly unexplained craft were being seen in our skies and couldn't be explained. Moreover, I was fascinated by the University of Colorado UFO study that was then ongoing. This was basically an attempt by the Air Force to have the UFO problem looked at scientifically. The whole thing just fascinated me, and I've been fascinated from that day to this. KING: Bruce, what got you involved in things up there? [BRUCE MACCABEE](http://www.coasttocoastam.com/guests/447.html), UFO RESEARCHER: Back in the '50s an '60s when there were lots of sightings around, I knew about them but I didn't really do anything about it until about the middle '60s when there were a lot of sightings in the United States that resulted in the University of Colorado study that Bob Swiatek just referred to. At that time I decided that if there was really something there, [it was] in the interviews with the actual witnesses. So I went with a group known then as Night Cap, and we interviewed some people that would have various types of sightings, and it turned out they weren't nuts. So I decided there might be really something going on.

KING: Okay, we've got to have drawn sides here. In March of 1997 there were numerous reports from people who claim to see mysterious lights over Phoenix, Arizona. In a special on UFOs earlier this year, ABC's Peter Jennings explored it. **([BEGIN VIDEOTAPE](http://abcnews.go.com/Technology/Primetime/story?id=468496)) [see a six-minute video clip of this siting at [http://www.thephoenixlights.net](http://www.thephoenixlights.net) and see [this CNN page](http://www.cnn.com/US/9706/19/ufo.lights/index.html) for more on the Phoenix sitings and excellent links.] ** **PETER JENNINGS, ABC ANCHOR (voice-over): There have been UFO sightings with hundreds, even thousands of eyewitnesses. Phoenix, Arizona, March 13th, 1997.** **UNIDENTIFIED MALE: There were some incredible sightings over Phoenix, called the Phoenix Lights. And they occurred while I was doing my program. I took call after call after call of people in Phoenix saying oh my God, what's flying over our city?** **JENNINGS: At 8:30 p.m. that night hundreds of people reported seeing a mysterious flying something.** (END VIDEOTAPE) KING: By the way, a skeptic interviewed for that ABC special claimed the lights were merely flares and aircraft flying in formation, and people were just connecting dots. John, that's a classic example of so many things we've seen and heard through the years. What do you believe? SCHUESSLER: I believe there are actual unconventional flying objects in our skies on a regular basis. We at MUFON get over 300 calls a month of raw data. About 10 percent resulting in good sightings. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) [[order excellent Sci-Fi network video \"Out of the Blue\" here](https://www.WantToKnow.info/resources#out)] UNIDENTIFIED MALE: **The UFO phenomenon really took off, actually, in June of 1947 in the State of Washington when a pilot by the name of Kenneth Arnold saw many objects going in formation at a very, very high speed by Mount Rainier in Washington. Arnold said that the nine silvery objects he'd seen looked like saucers skipping over a pond. The next day, his story was front-page news, and a new term entered the American lexicon -- flying saucer.** (END VIDEOTAPE) KING: That's from a Sci-Fi network special aired recently on Roswell and UFOs [order this excellent documentary at link immediately above].

Budd Hopkins, I know you're a believer. But Seth just said there's no proof can be shown. Can you show us tonight right now absolute proof that extraterrestrials came here? HOPKINS: The first thing I want to say is about a believer. There are two groups of people looking into the subject. The true believers and the pragmatists. The pragmatists believe when they hear a story of an abduction, for instance, that either there's a mental problem or there's a hoax or that it really happened. The true believers, and Susan Clancy would be certainly one of the true believers, know in advance that this did not happen, that this is a false memory. And she has said so in her writing. In other words, rather than investigating she makes the assumption that these are simply impossible. The point is we have to test each one and look into it. KING: What do you believe? Do you believe that extraterrestrials have come to the planet earth? HOPKINS: We don't know where they're from. The interesting thing is we know what they're doing, what they look like, the marks they leave on the ground and on people, and how they can be photographed. Yet we don't know where they come from, what their ultimate goal is. KING: No one can know that. Dr. Clancy, if I told you I saw one today or I was abducted, you would definitely say that I was whacko? CLANCY: No. I would never say you were whacko, Larry King. In fact, I don't think anybody who sees aliens or thinks they have been abducted is necessarily whacko. In fact, the research shows otherwise. In general, people who believe they've been abducted are not suffering from any more psychopathology than the average person. I would think that you actually thought you saw an alien. But I would also know that what you think you saw is not necessarily what you actually saw. KING: How would you know that? CLANCY: I mean, human perceptual systems are frail. How would I know that? I wouldn't know it for sure. I would think it was interesting, but until I saw some form of objective evidence that it was extraterrestrial in nature, I wouldn't believe it. KING: Before Rob shows us some extraordinary pictures and the whole panel comments, in 1997 the U.S. Air Force issued a report declaring the Roswell case closed. The Air Force said the so-called space aliens were military dummies used in high altitude parachute drops. What do we make, Bruce Maccabee, of Roswell? MACCABEE: Well, I think something actually occurred which has not yet been explained.** I have", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:051018ufoslarryking.txt:4:a18ffc45cf61", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 7476, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "051018ufoslarryking.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "051018ufoslarryking", "chunk_index": 5, "text": "of objective evidence that it was extraterrestrial in nature, I wouldn't believe it.

MACCABEE: Well, I think something actually occurred which has not yet been explained.** I have not been convinced by what the Air Force claimed and, of course, what I call the dummy drop theory of Roswell doesn't satisfy anyone. Even the skeptics tended to laugh at that. I like to stick to the testimony of the original witnesses which made claims about extreme characteristics of the materials that were found and so on.** My own opinion, however, has not been based on Roswell, but on all the other types of sightings that I have investigated, including photographic film and video cases. KING: Why do you think, Rob, that they go over strange places? They never land in Washington, DC at noon while Congress is in session. SWIATEK: If we are indeed dealing with alien intelligence, we have absolutely no idea what this alien intelligence - how it would act and what it would do. How does any of us as a human being know how an alien race would think? Their idea of contact might be to never approach main government buildings or land at the mall. So I think it's just kind of ridiculous to discount the whole phenomenon because they don't do what we as humans think they would do. KING: Well, since this has been reported for ages, are we ever going to know Rob? SWIATEK: Yes, I think we will know, Larry. I think this problem is amenable by science. But I'm not going to say we're dealing with ETs because I think that's one step beyond where we are as researchers of this phenomenon. The first thing we do is deal with the data such as it is. And if the data is that they never land in public places and that they just have overflights of military bases or airline pilots deal with these things and see them, then we have to investigate those data. That's what science does. And **unfortunately mainstream science hasn't yet looked at the really good cases in the UFO subject that exist.** KING: What do pilots tell you, John? SCHUESSLER: Well, pilots tell us real good stuff. You have to stop and think. **A pilot is a highly credible, highly trained good observer that protects the lives of millions of people a day. They say that things fly up to their aircraft. They're quite often noticed on radar.

[They are] not amorphous lights in the sky, [but rather] structural, physical things that come right up to them. They say this is bizarre. This is beyond belief. ** KING: Rob has brought extraordinary photos. Rob, we'll put some up and talk about them. First, this is McMinnville, Oregon. SWIATEK: Larry, McMinnville, Oregon, was a series of two UFO photographs. You are looking at, I believe, photograph two there. That is photograph number one. These photos have passed the muster over many years of study of many experts, including Dr. Maccabee here. Now the thing I wanted to qualify about UFO photographs is that in and of themselves they don't prove we're dealing with ETs. Any photograph can be hoaxed. The good thing about photographs like McMinnville is that all the obvious explanations of how the photographs might have been hoaxed have been ruled out, i.e: a model suspended from the wires. It's certainly not an unusual cloud. It's not something that the witnesses threw in front of them like a Frisbee and photographed. Extensive research by private sector scientists like Dr. Maccabee and by the University of Colorado study back in the '60s couldn't explain these sightings. KING: Susan, how do you react when you look at that? CLANCY: I think that could have been somebody throwing a disk in the sky and taking a picture of it. [What] I find interesting about the pictures is they're flying saucers. And I want to remind the viewers that flying saucers were supposedly first seen by Kenneth Arnold in 1947, but if you actually look at the transcripts of what he said he saw, he did not see flying saucers. He actually saw crescent-shaped objects that moved like a saucer would, if you skipped it across the water. The media got confused, reported that flying saucers were shown and it was flying saucers ever since. The pictures are somebody trying to create the illusion of flying saucers or somebody took a picture of some weird thing in the sky [that] happened to look like a flying saucer. It's certainly not evidence that there's something extraterrestrial in the sky. KING: Budd Hopkins, to you what does it mean? HOPKINS: Well, it's just one more piece of evidence that supports the physical reality of these objects. Here's the thing about the abduction phenomenon [as] it connects with photographs like this. We have", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:051018ufoslarryking.txt:6:41315922a31a", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 7478, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "051018ufoslarryking.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "051018ufoslarryking", "chunk_index": 7, "text": "to create the illusion of flying saucers or somebody took a picture of some weird thing in the sky [that] happened to look like a flying saucer. It's certainly not evidence that there's something extraterrestrial in the sky. KING: Budd Hopkins, to you what does it mean? HOPKINS: Well, it's just one more piece of evidence that supports the physical reality of these objects. Here's the thing about the abduction phenomenon [as] it connects with photographs like this. We have over and over again physical marks on people's bodies that are somehow inflicted upon them when they're abducted into craft. I've seen perhaps 100 what we call scoop marks. These are like the one at the bottom -- the straight line cut on the woman's body. I've seen dozens and dozens of these. The doctor the next day asked if she had some kind of surgery. There's a scoop mark on the back of a leg. Here's a scoop mark on the front of the leg. We have hundreds of these. On top of that, when a UFO lands, it manages very often to bake the soil -- kills the grass. The soil is baked to a kind of rock-like consistency. We have had these rocklike things analyzed. KING: What does all that say to you? HOPKINS: Well, this is a physical thing. **The idea that this is sleep paralysis, which is the big explanation du jour is as completely full of holes as Bush's rationale for invading Iraq. The first thing about the sleep paralysis is for the first 15 or 20 years of abduction research, not one single person was in the bedroom asleep. ** UNIDENTIFIED MALE (video clip): Here's a flying saucer in a rare close up portrait. But this one is no mystery. Unlike its high-flying cousins, this saucer is created in an army laboratory at Ft. Belvoir, Virginia. Physicist Noel Scott, who discovered the effect, says it's the same phenomenon that has baffled scientists, hexed radar screens and led pilots on costly wild saucer chases. A mass of air under low pressure and electrically charged, as you see taking the shape of a glowing saucer. It's the answer to the year's number one scientific mystery, or is it? KING: Let's look at some more pictures from Rob Squiretech's collection. What's this in Santa Ana, Rob? SWIATEK: Well, I don't actually know what it is, Larry, but yes, it is one of a sequence of four photographs that were taken of seemingly -- I'll put the words alleged and seemingly before the word object each time I say it, a large metallic disk that crossed the road in front of a highway inspector in 1965.

Again, these photos have passed muster with investigators. They've ruled out the hand-throwing model, which Susan seems so blithely to describe as the source of all of these photographs. What is left is the puzzle and the enigma that we need to figure out. The person who took these, Mr. Heflin, had a pretty unimpeachable character and no strings were found from which this object was dangled from in his truck, nor double exposure or anything like that. KING: How do you respond, Seth, to what you see? SHOSTAK: Well, look, one of the problems with these photos... KING: Come on, it is pretty amazing. SHOSTAK: Well, yes, but it could be, as Susan has suggested, just a hubcap thrown up and somebody takes pictures. There saying that's not... KING: Don't look like a hubcap. SHOSTAK: It doesn't look like a hubcap, but the point is that there's no point of reference. You don't know how far away that thing is. It could be an aircraft that's very far away and only looks like it's up close. You need, you know, you need a couple of cameras. KING: Doesn't look like an aircraft. SHOSTAK: There's something in the sky there. To say that it's alien craft, that's a big step. KING: President Carter's reported seeing things. SHOSTAK: It was Venus. He's an unimpeachable source and it was actually extraterrestrial, but it was Venus. KING: Bruce Maccabee, what do you believe about these photos? MACCABEE: Well, these photos have been studied for many, many years, since the time they were taken in '65, I think it was. And they have, as Bob pointed out, passed muster over and over and over again. Nobody ever managed to prove that [the photographer] would be a person likely to make any sort of hoax. These things are either the real thing or a hoax. I mean, it's really an unexplained object or hoax. There's no halfway point. In my opinion, having studied what these other people have done and my own investigation of the photos themselves indicate that this is a real object, and there is a possibility of estimating, let's say, distance and size based on the atmospheric effects on the photo -- on the object itself, indicating how bright it is as a function of distance. It's a bit technical, but it does suggest that the object was probably within a few thousand feet of the", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:051018ufoslarryking.txt:8:6c32b23bb70a", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 7480, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "051018ufoslarryking.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "051018ufoslarryking", "chunk_index": 9, "text": "my opinion, having studied what these other people have done and my own investigation of the photos themselves indicate that this is a real object, and there is a possibility of estimating, let's say, distance and size based on the atmospheric effects on the photo -- on the object itself, indicating how bright it is as a function of distance. It's a bit technical, but it does suggest that the object was probably within a few thousand feet of the camera. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) WOLF BLITZER, HOST, \"WOLF BLITZER REPORTS\": **What was in the skies over Mexico in March? Members of the Mexican Air Force think they could be UFOs. Pilots taped 11 unidentified flying objects over southern parts of the country near the Gulf of Mexico. Only three of the objects showed up on RADAR and members of the plane's crew say it seemed as if the bright lights were responding to them.** (END VIDEO CLIP) KING: That was a Wolf Blitzer report on CNN. John, what do you make of it? SCHUESSLER: Well, that was an excellent report. And it kind of thrilled us all, because we had an air interdiction aircraft that had forward looking infrared radar that was picking up heat images of something. And the analysis of that has stood the test of time. Again, Dr. Maccabee has done a through analysis, and one of the objects was obviously what we consider an unconventional flying object. Some of the others were something else. KING: Dr. Maccabee, what are we looking at? MACCABEE: Well, after doing an extensive study of the videotape that I was sent by the Mexican Air Force, I concluded that some of these objects were actually lights, most likely to be lights on the ground. But on the other hand, this whole event started when the surveillance aircraft flying over the Yucatan peninsula picked up a radar target that got within two miles, and tracked it, followed it for ten miles, and was not able to see anything associated with the radar target, either visually or with the forward-looking infrared. And that by itself is unusual. I would consider that to be what we call a radar unidentified flying object, because it was a radar target. These other lights that you see, some of them are probably lights on the ground. There may be some UFO lights mixed in. But until the Mexican Air Force actually does some experiments that I recommended, we wouldn't be able to tell for certain. KING: Budd, why would the government hide the information from the public if they had it? HOPKINS: Larry, if all a person could say is, my fellow Americans, they are here.

Now, I always said I would rather be in the liquor business at that point, than the stock market. But **the most important point here, Larry, is that [in a] conversation I had years ago with the late Carl Sagan, we agreed that the UFO phenomenon was an extraordinary phenomenon.** **KING: Well, what did Carl say? ** **HOPKINS: We agreed that all of this together constitutes an extraordinary phenomenon. What I said to Dr. Sagan was: shouldn't we be saying an extraordinary phenomenon demands an extraordinary investigation? We're not getting an investigation here. We're getting, unfortunately, lots of arm chair theorists who sit away from the investigation process, who have actually never really gone out to examine the site, the physical marks, or to do any medical work. ** **KING: I will confirm that, because I interviewed the late Dr. Sagan many times, and he was open to the possibility and to more investigation of it. ** Budd Hopkins, do you think we're going to ever have proof in our lifetime? HOPKINS: Well, I never use the word proof. I use the term evidence. We have so much evidence that we can hardly handle it. We have to remember that in terms of proof that there's still something like 10 or 15 percent of the American public do not believe that the Holocaust occurred. It has not been proved to them. So, my point is, the evidence is so extensive and so complex. I've been doing this for 30 years, and I'm talking about the medical evidence, and even though Susan just mentioned sleep paralysis, we have hundreds and hundreds of abduction cases where's people are driving cars. I was just dealing with a police sergeant who was abducted. His family, seven people, saw the craft coming at rooftop height in the middle of the afternoon over their picnic. And he was been abducted and returned. KING: Why don't they ever abduct Colin Powell. You know, abduct Seth Shostak. Why don't they take you? You come back on this show.

Visitors to the park flock through her town, but few tourists venture into her shop, as it lacks the modern hair dryers travelers expect. Her small income makes saving difficult. \"My life's ambition is to have my own equipment\" she says-even one modern hairdryer for tourists (see photo & description of Mariate in the Sept 2005 issue of *National Geographic*, p. 120). Using your investment through the growing international microcredit movement, Mariate takes out a microloan of $100-small by western standards, but more than enough to pay for a modern hairdryer in Zambia. With the increased tourist traffic to her shop, Mariate pays back her loan within a year.** Once the loan is repaid, she has now greatly increased her income and can afford to keep her children in school, give them good medical care, and build her business further. **You pulled this family out of poverty! **Example 2.** Working 10 to 12 hours six days a week, 36-year-old Supratno drives a pedicab (bicycle taxi with three wheels) in the suburbs of Jakarta, Indonesia. As over 50% of his daily income goes to pay rental fees to the large syndicate which monopolizes pedicab rentals in Jakarta, he barely ekes out a living for his family of four. His daily income averages about US $4 per day, which is only enough to put rice and vegetables on the table for his family twice a day. He cannot afford to pay the small fees for administration and mandatory school uniforms to send his children to public school.

He cannot afford to pay the small fees for administration and mandatory school uniforms to send his children to public school. Taking out a microcredit loan of $200 from money you invested, Supratno buys his own pedicab for the first time in his life. As all income now goes directly to him, his daily income is more than doubled. **Within a year, he pays back the $200 loan and can now afford to send his children to school and give them three good meals every day. **You pulled this family out of poverty! The microcredit process is actually a little more involved than described above. Business plans are required to be submitted to a volunteer cooperative and loans are made in increments, but you get the picture. Your loan of $1,000 for one year can literally pull several entire families out of poverty for good in the developing world. The interest you receive on your microcredit investment is low-generally up to four percent-but** you have the satisfaction of knowing that for every $1,000 invested, you have helped several families every year to pull out of poverty and live a much better life! **I'd say that's a pretty good return on your investment. When I first heard about microcredit back in 1999, I was very excited. As a part-time interpreter for the US Department of State and a part-time nurse, my work provided no retirement benefits, so I had diligently been investing a percentage of my income in order to be able to retire at a reasonable age. I had saved over $100,000 towards my retirement at the time and was interested in finding better ways to invest this money. **Socially Responsible Investing and Microcredit ** For many years prior I had practiced socially responsible investing (SRI), where both the investor's financial needs and an investment's impact on society are considered. With SRI, I had the high returns of Wall Street on my investments while knowing that my money was not being used to promote socially damaging concerns such as alcohol, tobacco, gambling, weapons, and sweat shops. For more on SRI, [click here](https://web.archive.org/web/20120204231013/http://www.ussif.org/resources/sriguide/). With microcredit, I realized I would be giving up the high returns I had been getting with SRI. Yet knowing that every $1,000 dollars I invested would help to pull several families out of poverty every year, I was more than happy to settle for a 2% return. **Within a few years, I had every penny possible invested in microcredit.** So though I'm only getting a modest (but very secure) financial", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:051023microcredit.txt:1:4a4bc2b806c5", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 7485, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "051023microcredit.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "051023microcredit", "chunk_index": 2, "text": "and sweat shops.

Addressing the International Year of Microcredit, [UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan](http://www.un.org/News/Press/docs/2004/sgsm9601.doc.htm) stated, \"Microfinance has proved its value as a weapon against poverty and hunger. It really can change peoples' lives for the better-especially the lives of those who need it most. With access to microfinance, [the poor] can move beyond day-to-day survival towards planning for the future. They can break the vicious circle of poverty. Microfinance is not charity. It is a way to extend the same rights and services to low-income households that are available to everyone else. It grows productive enterprises and allows communities to prosper. Let us use this International Year of Microcredit to put millions of families on the path to prosperity.\" For the official website of the International Year of Microcredit, [click here](http://www.yearofmicrocredit.org/).

The nearly 20 current or former officials from the FBI, CIA, Defense Intelligence Agency, and even the supersecret National Security Agency who make up the core of the conference share an unusual distinction: They are all deeply out of favor with their longtime employers.** After speaking up, either internally or publicly, about alleged wrongdoings, many have been pushed out, typically under a cloud of usually unrelated but classified personal allegations. Many are still fighting to preserve their careers or at least their reputations. **Most cannot discuss the allegations they are making in detail because the specifics are highly classified. Some even have trouble outlining the alleged violations that ended their own careers. The agencies they work for also refuse to answer questions about the specific cases.** So this disparate lot of intelligence and law enforcement veterans came together this week to see what they might all have in common. The tone was deeply pessimistic. In the wake of 9/11, many in Washington had voiced strong support for whistleblowers like [Colleen Rowley](https://www.WantToKnow.info/021222time.personofyear), the FBI analyst who wrote a memo laying out a series of failures in the case of Zacarias Moussaoui, who had been arrested while attending flight school a month before the al Qaeda attacks. **But the current and former officials at the conference said that today's climate in Washington has never been worse for whistleblowers.** Citing", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:051027whistleblowersnationalsecurity.txt:0:8fdd9c9b8c62", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 7488, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "051027whistleblowersnationalsecurity.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "051027whistleblowersnationalsecurity", "chunk_index": 1, "text": "in common.

Lt. Col. Anthony Shaffer is the military intelligence operative who recently went public with a controversial claim that a year before September 11, his top-secret task force \"[Able Danger](https://www.WantToKnow.info/abledanger911)\" was able to identify the man who later turned out to be the lead hijacker as being connected to al Qaeda.** Shaffer is a veteran of top-secret operations against terrorists, including some in Afghanistan, and several of his DIA colleagues have come out publicly to confirm that they remember Mohamed Atta being identified in 2000 as part of a project that combed through public databases looking for hidden links. But these allegations have been vigorously denied by the Pentagon and the White House, while several members of Congress are investigating. Shaffer was slated to speak but instead sat quietly by as his lawyer, Mark Zaid, spoke for him. **\"Tony is not allowed to talk,\" Zaid said. \"He is effectively gagged from talking. He is gagged from talking to Congress.\"** Indeed, while Shaffer's case is being championed by Republican Rep. Curt Weldon, the Pentagon has prohibited him from speaking further to members of Congress without prior approval. He has already watched the Pentagon revoke his security clearance. Zaid says that the Pentagon cited a series of old, unsubstantiated claims that had been addressed during his routine security screenings earlier in his career. \"When he was 15, he took some pens from the U.S. Embassy where he was doing an internship,\" Zaid said. \"This is one of the reasons\" Shaffer was given for the revocation. Officials also brought up several newer allegations, including two small claims of unauthorized expenses, as well as an allegation that he accepted an award to which he was not entitled. Zaid says that Shaffer disputes all the allegations and can offer evidence in his defense. Still, several lawyers agreed that there is not much room for appeal when a security clearance is revoked. Now, Zaid says, Shaffer- who is still employed by the DIA -is worried about getting fired from his job. \"We're trying to figure out what we can do,\" Zaid said, \"which is not much.\"", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:051027whistleblowersnationalsecurity.txt:1:bcf46459aa9f", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 7489, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "051027whistleblowersnationalsecurity.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "051027whistleblowersnationalsecurity", "chunk_index": 2, "text": "an allegation that he accepted an award to which he was not entitled.

Now, Zaid says, Shaffer- who is still employed by the DIA -is worried about getting fired from his job. \"We're trying to figure out what we can do,\" Zaid said, \"which is not much.\" But he added that he will most likely appeal the clearance revocation. Zaid is also looking into filing a class action suit related to the revocations of security clearances in whistleblower cases. \"It's the mentality of how the executive branch works,\" he said. \"You can show a pattern.\" It's something that several other panelists had in common. Russ Tice worked as an analyst at the NSA, which houses the nation's international eavesdropping capabilities. He worked on some of the nation's most secret intelligence-collection projects. But while he was on temporary assignment at the DIA, he said, he became concerned that an analyst there might be spying for the Chinese government. \"She exhibited the classic signs,\" he said, including unauthorized foreign trips, apparently living well beyond her means, and voicing unusually strong negative opinions about Taiwan. But **after raising concerns to counterintelligence officials over several years, he suddenly found his own career in trouble after an unusual emergency psychiatric evaluation concluded he was a psychotic paranoid. \"How could something like this happen? I implicated a lady whose mother was well-connected,\" he said. He was sent to work at the NSA motor pool and eventually lost his security clearances.** Another panelist, John Cole, was an 18-year veteran of the FBI before he raised allegations that several bureau translators might be engaged in espionage, including at least one who worked on South Asian issues. \"Nobody wanted to hear what I had to say,\" he recalled. \"I hand carried a letter to [FBI Director Robert] Mueller's office.\" He was reassigned several times, and after raising the cases with several senators, he was eventually pushed out of the FBI under a cloud. As with Shaffer and several other panelists, the FBI revoked Cole's security clearance after a few security allegations. Cole now works counterintelligence and counterterrorism issues for the U.S. Air Force, even though he says the FBI still treats him with disdain. \"I never thought I would be a whistleblower,\" he said. \"There has to be some way to get people to listen and make a change, because otherwise there will be another 9/11.\" **The conference was organized by Sibel Edmonds, a former FBI translator who was pushed out of the bureau after [raising accusations](https://www.WantToKnow.info/sibeledmonds) of wrongdoing by other FBI translators.

These people go through the chain of command and Congress and usually the media as a last resort.\" But government whistleblowers, especially those in the national security area, do not enjoy nearly as much legal protection as their corporate counterparts. Many complain of significant retaliation. Her group now boasts at least 60 members, all of whom are current and former intelligence and law enforcement officials.

As [Jeff Stein](http://www.cq.com/corp/show.do?page=corp_pr20050831), national security reporter at the *Congressional Quarterly*, points out in the informative article below, the deeper story has to do with intelligence schisms and fabrication of intelligence for the purpose of drawing the US into war. **Those in power know that war, whether justified or not, is the most reliable profit-producing activity around.** When the [ruling elite](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/4290944.stm) care more about profits than about doing what is best for the nation and world, we end up in protracted wars like Vietnam and Iraq.

As far back as the 1950s, when the Air Force claimed there was a missile gap between the United States and Russia, the CIA proved to be a sticking point. Only when the agency sent its new U-2 spy plane soaring over the Soviet Union, taking pictures of air bases and missiles from 80,000 feet, did U.S. arms-control advocates have the ammunition they needed to beat back the furor. **In the 1970s, when President Richard Nixon's policy of détente was under attack by some former military officials and conservative policy intellectuals, Ford administration officials Dick Cheney and Donald Rumsfeld were among those challenging as too soft the CIA's estimate of Moscow's military power. ** **Rumsfeld and Cheney wanted to create a \"Team B,\"** which would have access to the CIA's data on the Soviets and issue its own conclusions. Cheney, as White House chief of staff, and Rumsfeld, as secretary of Defense, championed Team B, whose members included the young defense strategist Paul Wolfowitz, who a quarter-century later would be one of the chief architects of the 2003 invasion of Iraq. **CIA Director William Colby rejected the Team B idea and was fired. Colby's successor as head of the spy agency, George H.W. Bush, the current president's father, accepted it. ** Team B's conclusion that the CIA was indeed soft on the Soviets was leaked to sympathetic journalists and generated public support for a new round of military spending, particularly on missiles. Team B's conclusions turned out, years later, to be false. **\"In retrospect, and with the Team B report and records now largely declassified, it is possible to see that virtually all of Team B's criticisms ... proved to be wrong,\"** Raymond Garthoff, a former U.S. ambassador to Bulgaria, wrote in a paper for the CIA's Center for the Study of Intelligence three years ago. \"On several important specific points it wrongly criticized and 'corrected' the official estimates, always in the direction of enlarging the impression of danger and threat.\" Another run at controlling the CIA was taken when then-President", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:051031intelligencewarfabrication.txt:1:3ebf939c3527", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 7493, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "051031intelligencewarfabrication.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "051031intelligencewarfabrication", "chunk_index": 2, "text": "records now largely declassified, it is possible to see that virtually all of Team B's criticisms ... proved to be wrong,\"** Raymond Garthoff, a former U.S. ambassador to Bulgaria, wrote in a paper for the CIA's Center for the Study of Intelligence three years ago. \"On several important specific points it wrongly criticized and 'corrected' the official estimates, always in the direction of enlarging the impression of danger and threat.\" Another run at controlling the CIA was taken when then-President Ronald Reagan appointed businessman William Casey CIA director with a mandate to ride herd on supposed agency liberals. Casey set up the irregular, covert operation led by Marine Corps Col. Oliver North, which eventually ended in the Iran-Contra arms-for-hostages scandal. Likewise, **when Reagan's Secretary of State George Schultz wanted to secretly back Saddam Hussein against the Iranians, Schultz bypassed the CIA and sent Rumsfeld, then a businessman, to Baghdad to seal the deal. ** The path to Plame's outing also led through Baghdad, this time via Iraqi exile Ahmed Chalabi, who had been abandoned by the CIA in the late 1990s as too troublesome, unreliable and corrupt. Among Chalabi's key supporters were Rumsfeld, Cheney and Wolfowitz. When the three came back into power in January 2001, the CIA and State Department still refused to back Chalabi. Cheney began visiting CIA headquarters to challenge its analysts over their intelligence on Hussein's weapons. To Richard Kerr, the former chief of CIA analysis who later studied the agency's pre-war reporting on Iraq, Cheney displayed no anti-CIA animus at the time. \"My experience was to the contrary,\" Kerr said by e-mail. \"He would not accept all our analysis without skepticism and believed we were better on some subjects than others. But those are the characteristics of a good customer.\" **Over at the Pentagon, however, Rumsfeld was reprising Team B by creating his own intelligence shop. The Chalabi organization's alarmist reports on Hussein's nuclear weapons, which later proved to be false, bypassed the CIA and went directly to the White House. ** \"That's why they set up an intelligence unit in [Undersecretary of Defense Douglas] Feith's office,\" said intelligence historian James Bamford. \"The whole purpose was to get that kind of information and send it to Cheney.\" In 2002, CIA analysts thought so little of a report that Hussein had obtained uranium yellow cake from Niger to build a bomb that they didn't even include it in the president's daily briefing, Bamford said. \"The Pentagon got it and flagged it to get Cheney's attention,\" he added, riling the White House further. Then covert CIA officer Plame, a specialist on weapons of mass destruction, helped arrange for her husband, career diplomat Joseph Wilson, to investigate the yellow cake claim in Niger. As the world now knows, Wilson reported that there was nothing to it. And after President Bush offered the Niger intelligence as fact in his", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:051031intelligencewarfabrication.txt:2:001409fc7504", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 7494, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "051031intelligencewarfabrication.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "051031intelligencewarfabrication", "chunk_index": 3, "text": "it in the president's daily briefing, Bamford said. \"The Pentagon got it and flagged it to get Cheney's attention,\" he added, riling the White House further.

Over the past two decades the pharmaceutical industry has moved very far from its original high purpose of discovering and producing useful new drugs. Now primarily a marketing machine to sell drugs of dubious benefit, this industry uses its wealth and power to co-opt every institution that might stand in its way, including the US Congress, the FDA, academic medical centers, and the medical profession itself.\"** \"The great majority of 'new' drugs are not new at all but merely variations of older drugs already on the market. These are called 'me-too' drugs. The idea is to grab a share of an established, lucrative market by producing something very similar to a top-selling drug.

Legislators are now so beholden to the pharmaceutical industry that it will be exceedingly difficult to break its lock on them. But the one thing legislators need more than campaign contributions is votes. That is why citizens should know what is really going on.

In 1979, I was an energetic 21-year-old college student living in a fun dormitory on the beautiful campus of UC Santa Cruz in California. One calm autumn evening, my roommate, John, asked me to go with him to a meeting put on by [Volunteers In Asia](http://www.viaprograms.org) (VIA). VIA is a non-profit educational exchange organization that sends college undergrads to Asia to experience life in a foreign culture while teaching English there. Besides being very busy with studies that evening, I wasn't at all interested in leaving college or living overseas. At first, I told John I just didn't have time. But after several sincere appeals, I had to agree that John was shy and that there was no way he would go alone. Only because I knew it might really change his life, I reluctantly agreed to accompany him. At the meeting, VIA volunteers recently returned from teaching English in Asia excitedly shared colorful slides and fascinating stories about their transformative cross-cultural experiences in Asia. I was surprised to soon find myself captivated and even infected by their incredible vibrance and passion. Their vivid descriptions were filled with enthusiasm, joy, and powerful awakenings. The lives of these young adventurers had clearly been dramatically enriched by their rich journeys.** The end result was that though John never went to Japan, I, having been dragged most reluctantly to this meeting, ended up going to live in Asia as a volunteer English teacher!** On applying to VIA for a volunteer position, I requested Japan as my first choice, as I had to pay my own plane fare and Japan was the least expensive of the countries served. But I told them that I would go anywhere they sent me if the few available Japanese positions filled. They chose Indonesia for me, which at the time I didn't even realize was a country.

But I told them that I would go anywhere they sent me if the few available Japanese positions filled. They chose Indonesia for me, which at the time I didn't even realize was a country. I had thought it was a small group of islands somewhere in the Pacific. I fully trusted, though, that I was being guided to the right place for me. In Indonesia, I lived for the entire year of 1981 on the west side of the vast island of Borneo with the warmest, most wonderful Muslim family in the world.** As my newly adopted father was an MD, he supported his parents and a couple siblings and in-laws and their children, so that in all, we had an extended family of 20 people living under one roof!** My adopted mother there was one of the kindest, most saintly women I've ever met. I had countless amazingly rich experiences with this gentle, loving family and the warm, welcoming people of Indonesia. Even with all of the constant activity of my large, adopted family and home, for the entire year abroad I found myself studying the Indonesian language like a maniac - two to three hours almost every day. I knew that language was crucial to diving into the culture, but I was way overboard in how much I studied. I made over 6,000 flash cards and even memorized every word in a couple small dictionaries. Yet somehow, I sensed there was a greater reason for it all. By the end of my year there, I was quite fluent. In early 1986, five years after my time in Indonesia, I had just come back home from two intense years of teaching English at a college in communist China, again as a VIA volunteer. My time in China was filled with rich, sometimes challenging adventures quite different than Indonesia. Living in Wuhan (a city of six million about which few had ever heard until COVID hit), I had been the first foreigner in the city to be allowed to live together with local Chinese in a teachers dormitory. I managed to become fluent in Chinese, too. Yet now that I was back home, it was time to finally look for some income-producing work to feed my nearly empty bank account. A VIA friend of mine told me about an interesting job as a language interpreter taking influential foreign visitors on one-month study tours of the U.S. for the Department of State. I had never seriously considered being an interpreter, but this sounded quite interesting. They just happened to be interviewing near my home a month after", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:051119fredburkspresidentialinterpreter.txt:1:862bedaff415", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 7500, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "051119fredburkspresidentialinterpreter.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "051119fredburkspresidentialinterpreter", "chunk_index": 2, "text": "Yet now that I was back home, it was time to finally look for some income-producing work to feed my nearly empty bank account.

I had never seriously considered being an interpreter, but this sounded quite interesting. They just happened to be interviewing near my home a month after I heard about the job. **So thanks to all those hours studying like a maniac in Indonesia, I ended up with a great job as an Indonesian interpreter where I was paid to travel and study all over the U.S. with my distinguished Indonesian guests!** By the end of my first month in this fascinating new job, I realized I was a natural at interpreting. I was soon whispering simultaneously into the ears of my Indonesian visitors as our American hosts conversed with them. I saw that if I was willing to study more, I could become a really good simultaneous interpreter and possibly even interpret for top government officials some day. After opening to divine guidance, however, I became clear that I wanted to focus my time and energy on other, more meaningful matters. I chose not to spend too much time on language skills, and was perfectly content to continue as a low-level interpreter. In 1992 (six years later), now working only part time as an interpreter and part time with cancer patients as a registered nurse, I took an assignment as the administrative interpreter supporting two simultaneous interpreters at a government-sponsored seminar in Washington, DC. Because of the intense concentration needed, simultaneous interpreting requires two interpreters who switch off every 20 to 30 minutes. As the logistical support interpreter, I was out running errands for a few of the visitors when the seminar started. When I came back a few hours later, the group was on a break. As soon as he saw me,** Dan, one of the interpreters, grabbed me and franticly asked, \"Can you do any simultaneous interpreting?\" The other interpreter had fallen ill and had to go home.** Dan had been interpreting simultaneously for almost three hours without a break, which is almost unheard of. So even though I wasn't officially qualified, I stepped in, did great, and finished out the remainder of the week-long seminar as a simultaneous interpreter. On hearing about this, my boss at the State Department called me in to congratulate me. At his suggestion, I took and passed the test to become officially qualified as a simultaneous interpreter. It turns out that Indonesian interpreters are in great demand - especially simultaneous Indonesian interpreters. Indonesia is the fourth largest country in the world (population 220 million), yet very few Americans ever learn Indonesian (the national language).

Indonesia is the fourth largest country in the world (population 220 million), yet very few Americans ever learn Indonesian (the national language). So in 1995, three years after qualifying as a simultaneous interpreter, out of the blue I received a call from the State Department asking me to travel to Copenhagen to interpret for Vice President Al Gore at a UN Conference! Even though I wasn't officially qualified for high level interpreting, they couldn't find anyone else. So I went, had a great time, and shortly thereafter qualified at the State Department's highest level. Before my resignation due to excessive secrecy nine years later in 2004, I had interpreted for President Bill Clinton, President George W. Bush, Vice Presidents Gore and Cheney, Secretaries of State Albright and Powell, and numerous other presidents and officials from many countries. Whenever present in high-level meetings, I did my best to open to divine guidance, and to send out lots of love, support, and wishes for what's best to all present. **At key summit meetings, I even [invited many friends](https://www.WantToKnow.info/floodleaders) to take a moment in silence and join me in inviting our world leaders to open to what is best for all who share our world. I have no doubt that this is why I was led to this fascinating work.** And after witnessing undeniable deceit and manipulation towards the end of my State Department career, I was eventually led to become a whistleblower, even finding my whistleblowing activity reported on the front page of the *Wall Street Journal*. That's another fascinating story you can [read about here](https://www.WantToKnow.info/050226fredburkswsj). It's pretty amazing that without putting any effort in that direction, I ended up as the State Department's top Indonesian interpreter. It's even more amazing when you remember that I did not choose Indonesia and was dragged most reluctantly to that first VIA meeting years ago! There are many more little miracles to this story that, for reasons of space, I didn't include. For me, all of this shows that the more I open to divine guidance and to what's best for all, the more filled with miracles my life becomes.

This self-perpetuating and privately funded group of lobbyists and lawyers has recently opined on hurricanes, nuclear weapons, the Baltimore Harbor Tunnel and even the New York subway system. Now it offers yet another \"report card\" on the progress of the FBI and CIA in the war against terrorism, along with its \"back-seat\" take and some further unsolicited narrative about how things ought to be on the \"front lines.\" **Yet this is also a good time for the country to make some assessments of the 9/11 Commission itself. Recent revelations from the military intelligence operation code-named \"Able Danger\" have cast light on a missed opportunity that could have potentially prevented 9/11. Specifically, Able Danger concluded in February 2000 that military experts had identified Mohamed Atta by name (and maybe photograph) as an al Qaeda agent operating in the U.S. Subsequently, military officers assigned to Able Danger were prevented from sharing this critical information with FBI agents, even though appointments had been made to do so. Why?** There are other questions that need answers. Was Able Danger intelligence provided to the 9/11 Commission prior to the finalization of its report, and, if so, why was it not explored? In sum, what did the 9/11 commissioners and their staff know about Able Danger and when did they know it? **The Able Danger intelligence, if confirmed, is undoubtedly the most relevant fact of the entire post-9/11 inquiry.** Even", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:051126abledangerlouisfreeh.txt:0:e9fe5247b3a4", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 7504, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "051126abledangerlouisfreeh.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "051126abledangerlouisfreeh", "chunk_index": 1, "text": "agents, even though appointments had been made to do so.

In sum, what did the 9/11 commissioners and their staff know about Able Danger and when did they know it? **The Able Danger intelligence, if confirmed, is undoubtedly the most relevant fact of the entire post-9/11 inquiry.** Even the most junior investigator would immediately know that the name and photo ID of Atta in 2000 is precisely the kind of tactical intelligence the FBI has many times employed to prevent attacks and arrest terrorists. **Yet the 9/11 Commission inexplicably concluded that it \"was not historically significant.\" This astounding conclusion--in combination with the failure to investigate Able Danger and incorporate it into its findings--raises serious challenges to the commission's credibility and, if the facts prove out, might just render the commission historically insignificant itself.** The facts relating to Able Danger finally started to be reported in mid-August. U.S. Army Col. Anthony Shaffer, a veteran intelligence officer, publicly revealed that **the Able Danger team had identified Atta and three other 9/11 hijackers by mid-2000 but were prevented by military lawyers from giving this information to the FBI.** One week later, Navy Capt. Scott J. Phillpott, a U.S. Naval Academy graduate who managed the program for the Pentagon's Special Operations Command, confirmed \"Atta was identified by Able Danger by January-February of 2000.\" On Aug. 18, 2005, the Pentagon initially stated that \"a probe\" had found nothing to back up Col. Shaffer's claims. Two weeks later, however, Defense Department officials acknowledged that its \"inquiry\" had found \"three more people who recall seeing an intelligence briefing slide that identified the ringleader of the 9/11 attacks a year before the hijackings and terrorist strikes.\" These same officials also stated that \"documents and electronic files created by . . . Able Danger were destroyed under standing orders that limit the military's use of intelligence gathered about people in the United States.\" Then in September 2005, **the Pentagon doubled back and blocked several military officers from testifying at an open Congressional hearing about the Able Danger program.** **Two members of Congress, Curt Weldon and Dan Burton, have also publicly stated that shortly after the 9/11 attacks they provided then-Deputy National Security Adviser Stephen Hadley with a \"chart\" containing preattack information collected by Able Danger about al Qaeda.** A spokesperson for the White House has confirmed that Mr. Hadley \"recalled seeing such a chart in that time period but . . . did not recall whether he saw it during a meeting . . . and that a search of National Security Council files had failed to produce such a chart.\" **Thomas Kean, the chairman of the 9/11 Commission, reacted to Able Danger with the standard Washington", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:051126abledangerlouisfreeh.txt:1:1a0371e111dd", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 7505, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "051126abledangerlouisfreeh.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "051126abledangerlouisfreeh", "chunk_index": 2, "text": "\"chart\" containing preattack information collected by Able Danger about al Qaeda.** A spokesperson for the White House has confirmed that Mr. Hadley \"recalled seeing such a chart in that time period but . . . did not recall whether he saw it during a meeting . . . and that a search of National Security Council files had failed to produce such a chart.\" **Thomas Kean, the chairman of the 9/11 Commission, reacted to Able Danger with the standard Washington PR approach. He lashed out at the Bush administration and demanded that the Pentagon conduct an \"investigation\" to evaluate the \"credibility\" of Col. Shaffer and Capt. Phillpott**--rather than demand a substantive investigation into what failed in the first place. This from a former New Jersey governor who, along with other commissioners, routinely appeared in public espousing his own conclusions about 9/11 long before the commission's inquiry was completed and long before all the facts were in! This while dismissing out of hand the major conflicts of interest on the commission itself about obstructions to information-sharing within the intelligence community! Nevertheless, **the final 9/11 Commission report, released on July 22, 2004, concluded that \"American intelligence agencies were unaware of Mr. Atta until the day of the attacks.\" This now looks to be embarrassingly wrong.** Yet amazingly, commission leaders acknowledged on Aug. 12 that their staff in fact met with a Navy officer 10 days before releasing the report, who \"asserted that a highly classified intelligence operation, Able Danger, had identified Mohammed Atta to be a member of an al Qaeda cell located in Brooklyn.\" (Capt. Phillpott says he briefed them in July 2004.) **The commission's statement goes on to say that the staff determined that \"the officer's account was not sufficiently reliable to warrant revision of the report or further investigation,\" and that the intelligence operation \"did not turn out to be historically significant,\" despite substantial corroboration from other seasoned intelligence officers.** This dismissive and apparently unsupported conclusion would have us believe that a key piece of evidence was summarily rejected in less than 10 days without serious investigation. The commission, at the very least, should have interviewed the 80 members of Able Danger, as the Pentagon did, five of whom say they saw \"the chart.\" But this would have required admitting that the late-breaking news was inconveniently raised. So it was grossly neglected and branded as insignificant. **Such a half-baked conclusion, drawn in only 10 days without any real investigation, simply ignores what looks like substantial direct evidence to the contrary coming from our own trained military intelligence officers.** No wonder the 9/11 families were outraged by these revelations and called for a \"new\" commission to investigate. \"I'm angry that my son's death could have been prevented,\" seethed Diane Horning, whose son Matthew was killed at the World Trade Center.

On Aug. 17, 2005, a coalition of family members known as the September 11 Advocates rightly blasted 9/11 Commission leaders Mr. Kean and Lee Hamilton for pooh-poohing Able Danger's findings as not \"historically significant.\" Advocate Mindy Kleinberg aptly notes, \"They [the 9/11 Commission] somehow made a determination that this was not important enough. To me, that says somebody there is not using good judgment. And **if I'm questioning the judgment of this one case, what other things might they have missed?\" This is a stinging indictment of the commission by the 9/11 families.** The chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, Arlen Specter, has led the way in cleaning up the 9/11 Commission's unfinished business. Amid a very full plate of responsibilities, he conducted a hearing after noting that Col. Shaffer and Capt. Phillpott \"appear to have credibility.\" Himself a former prosecutor, Mr. Specter noted: \"If Mr. Atta and other 9/11 terrorists were identified before the attacks, it would be a very serious breach not to have that information passed along . . . we ought to get to the bottom of it.\" Indeed we should. The 9/11 Commission gets an \"I\" grade--incomplete--for its dereliction regarding Able Danger. **The Joint Intelligence Committees should reconvene and, in addition to Able Danger team members, we should have the 9/11 commissioners appear as witnesses so the families can hear their explanation why this doesn't matter.** **Mr. Freeh, a former FBI director, is the author of \"My FBI\" (St. Martin's, 2005).** **Note:** For other reliable news from the mainstream media on Able Danger, [click here](https://www.WantToKnow.info/abledanger911). **Finding Balance: WantToKnow.info Inspiration Center** WantToKnow.info believes it is important to balance disturbing cover-up information with inspirational writings which call us to be all that we can be and to work together for positive change.

They are nothing but pieces on the chessboard.\"** -- Verne Lyon, former CIA agent in revealing documentary *Secrets of the CIA* *Secrets of the CIA* is a revealing 45-minute Turner Home Entertainment documentary available for free viewing at the link below. **In this riveting exposé, five former CIA agents describe how their initial pride and enthusiasm at serving their nation turned to anguish and remorse, as they realized that they were actually subverting democracy and killing innocent civilians** all in the name \"national security\" and promoting foreign policy agendas. A Notre Dame football star, an aerospace engineering senior at Iowa State, an attractive high school graduate, a young patriot, and an Olympic shooting champion all were recruited by the CIA at a young age. These five brave individuals risk retaliation in revealing the story of their gradual disillusionment and finally defection from the CIA, as they eventually became convinced beyond a shadow of a doubt that they were serving neither democracy, nor the people of their country. The Olympic shooting champion describes being put in charge of overthrowing the democratically elected government of Guatemala. The patriot relates his deep remorse for his direct responsibility in the deaths of many innocent people for which he can never make amends. The pretty high school graduate describes how her initial addiction to power and intrigue turned to disgust and horror. **This powerful documentary is a rare and remarkable look at the results of unbridled secrecy and the lengths to which some elements in government will go to achieve questionable foreign policy goals. ** ***Secrets of the CIA* is available for free viewing at: [https://www.personalgrowthcourses.net/video/secrets_cia](https://www.personalgrowthcourses.net/video/secrets_cia) ** Watch a powerful [one-minute clip](https://www.personalgrowthcourses.net/video/cia_secret_weapon) from the *Secrets of the CIA* showing a top secret CIA weapon.

Dr. Steven M. Greer, who is mentioned by Mr. Hellyer, is a valuable member of the [WantToKnow.info team](https://www.WantToKnow.info/aboutus#greer).

Both Mr. Hellyer and Dr. Greer believe strongly that the UFOs do not constitute a threat to our nation or world. Dr. Greer has become the most trusted person to whom respected insiders will reveal information. He now has over 400 government and military witnesses with personal knowledge and/or involvement in the cover-up of UFOs. **The witnesses include several generals, admirals, astronauts, and other highly respected individuals.** You can order the [videotaped testimony](http://www.disclosureproject.org/shop.htm#Disclosure%202HR%20Video) of these witnesses and the book [*Disclosure*](http://www.disclosureproject.org/shop.htm#Disclosure%20Book), which provides the transcriptions of the testimony of over 60 of these witnesses at [http://www.disclosureproject.org](https://web.archive.org/web/20170305074656/http://www.disclosureproject.org/).

According to my next guest, the truth is out there. Actually up there, with our neighbor to the north, Canada. A former Canadian government official is warning we may be on the verge of intergalactic war, saying, quote, \"The Bush administration has finally agreed to let the military build a forward base on the moon, which will put them in a better position to keep track of the comings and goings of visitors from space and to shoot at them if they so decide,\" end quote. **Paul Hellyer is a former minister of defense and deputy prime minister of the country of Canada.** He joins us now from Toronto.

Mr. Hellyer, thanks a lot for coming on. PAUL HELLYER, FORMER DEFENSE MINISTER AND DEPUTY PRIME MINISTER, CANADA: Not at all, it's a pleasure. CARLSON: Now, you were the minister of defense of Canada. When you autopsied that position, I believe, under Prime Minister Lester Pearson, did you come across any classified information that suggested UFO's were real? HELLYER: No, not really. We got regular reports that showed that some of them were, in fact, unidentified. Some of the sightings could not be explained as natural phenomenon, but nothing more than that. CARLSON: Well, as you know, there's been this debate for years over whether or not they are real. Most people don't think they are real, or most people at least are hesitant to say they believe they are real in public. What convinced you they do, in fact, exist? HELLYER: Well, for the last two or three years, I have been looking at the evidence, and assessing it, much as I guess a judge would. And trying to determine who was telling the truth and who wasn't. And **I finally concluded, especially after reading a book called \"[The Day After Roswell](https://www.WantToKnow.info/resources#day),\" written by Colonel Philip Corso, that unidentified flying objects are, in fact real.** As real as the airplanes flying over your head, and that there has been a monumental cover-up for more than half a century. This is after, you know, looking at a lot of evidence and trying to discern who was telling the truth and who wasn't. And** I have concluded unequivocally that the people, who claim that they have either seen UFO's or have seen classified documents about UFO's or have seen wreckage from the crash at Roswell, on or about July 4, 1947, are the ones telling the truth**. And consequently, I am basing my policy considerations on that. CARLSON: Where did you come across this information that the Bush administration is building a forward base on the moon, and why would they do that? And why would they keep it from the public? HELLYER: Well, to answer your second question first, I don't know. That is the reason I am raising the question, is to see why they are. CARLSON: Well how do you-how do you-that's an awfully specific claim. I haven't read it in the \"New York Times.\" Doesn't mean it's not true, doesn't mean you're wrong, but I am interested to know why you think that. HELLYER: Well, because this was forecasted in Colonel Corso's book. They were wanting to build a base on the moon, as far back as 1964. And General Arthur Trudeau (ph) -- same name as one", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:051213paulhellyerufos.txt:1:c10f14798bf4", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 7515, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "051213paulhellyerufos.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "051213paulhellyerufos", "chunk_index": 2, "text": "is to see why they are.

HELLYER: Well, because this was forecasted in Colonel Corso's book. They were wanting to build a base on the moon, as far back as 1964. And General Arthur Trudeau (ph) -- same name as one of my bosses-was very determined to build a forward base on the moon. And prepared all of the specifications necessary for it, and the blueprints, and so on. CARLSON: Well, is it-pardon me. I don't mean to interrupt you, but doesn't this make sense? I mean, if, in fact, there are extraterrestrials and they are buzzing our planet, why wouldn't we want to take steps to defend ourselves from them should they turn hostile? HELLYER: Well, I think the critical question is whether or not they are hostile. You see, when they were first-when the crash first occurred, General Nathan Twining (ph) later became the... CARLSON: In Roswell? HELLYER: Yes, after that crash occurred, he declared that they were enemy aliens. Now, there's no evidence, that I have seen, that would really convince me that they are, in fact, you know enemy. And what I would like to know is whether that classification of enemy aliens still exists or whether it doesn't, and if it exists, what the evidence is on which the United States government bases its conclusions. I think that's tremendously important. CARLSON: I think that's an entirely fair question. Now, finally, **you laid out these views in September of this year at a speech at the University of Toronto, and according to the news report I have of the speech, your address, quote, \"ended with a standing ovation.\"** And that implies, I think, that your views are commonplace in Canada. They are a minority view here, distinct minority view. Do you think most Canadians believe that there is a forward base under construction on the Moon and that aliens are buzzing the earth? HELLYER: No, absolutely not. Most of them are skeptics. Most of them haven't spent much time researching the subject, and so they're, I think, the average here would be very similar to the average American. And **I am hoping that, maybe, we can persuade the Canadian Senate to hold hearings and listen to some of the 400 witnesses that your Dr. Steven-what's his name?

Mexican Fisherman Meets Harvard MBA: **What Really Matters in Life? Mexican Fisherman Meets Harvard MBA ** A vacationing American businessman standing on the pier of a quaint coastal fishing village in southern Mexico watched as a small boat with just one young Mexican fisherman pulled into the dock. Inside the small boat were several large yellowfin tuna. Enjoying the warmth of the early afternoon sun, the American complimented the Mexican on the quality of his fish. \"How long did it take you to catch them?\" the American casually asked. \"Oh, a few hours,\" the Mexican fisherman replied. \"Why don't you stay out longer and catch more fish?\" the American businessman then asked. The Mexican warmly replied, \"With this I have more than enough to meet my family's needs.\" The businessman then became serious, \"But what do you do with the rest of your time?\" Responding with a smile, the Mexican fisherman answered, \"I sleep late, play with my children, watch ball games, and take siesta with my wife. Sometimes in the evenings I take a stroll into the village to see my friends, play the guitar, sing a few songs...\" The American businessman impatiently interrupted, \"Look, I have an MBA from Harvard, and I can help you to be more profitable. You can start by fishing several hours longer every day. You can then sell the extra fish you catch. With the extra money, you can buy a bigger boat. With the additional income that larger boat will bring, before long you can buy a second boat, then a third one, and so on, until you have an entire fleet of fishing boats.\" Proud of his own sharp thinking, he excitedly elaborated a grand scheme which could bring even bigger profits, \"Then, instead of selling your catch to a middleman you'll be able to sell your fish directly to the processor, or even open your own cannery. Eventually, you could control the product, processing and distribution. You could leave this tiny coastal village and move to Mexico City, or possibly even Los Angeles or New York City, where you could even further expand your enterprise.\" Having never thought of such things, the Mexican fisherman asked, \"But how long will all this take?\" After a rapid mental calculation, the Harvard MBA pronounced, \"Probably about 15-20 years, maybe less if you work really hard.\" \"And then what, señor?\" asked the fisherman. \"Why, that's the best part!\" answered the businessman with a laugh. \"When the time is right, you would sell your company stock to the public and become very rich. You would make millions.\" \"Millions? Really? What would I do with it all?\" asked the young fisherman in disbelief. The businessman boasted, \"Then you could happily retire with all the money you've made.

Though the words may not touch everyone the way they did me, I invite you to see if there aren't a few pearls of wisdom below that might move and inspire you. I know from a place deep within that both individually and collectively, we are indeed shifting paradigms towards a life and world filled with ever deeper wisdom and integration. I share this essay wishing for you much inspiration and empowerment in all aspects of your life. May the times ahead for all of us be filled with an abundance of hope, meaning, and joy. With best wishes, Fred Burks [Former language interpreter](https://www.wanttoknow.info/g/fredburks/down_the_rabbit_hole) for Presidents Bush and Clinton *Shifting Paradigms* is also available at [https://www.WantToKnow.info/divinewisdomunderstanding](https://www.WantToKnow.info/divinewisdomunderstanding) **Shifting Paradigms** The wisdom and understanding of our own inner essence is a beacon that draws us inward toward ever deeper connection with the Divine. Yet rather than look for divine wisdom within, most people have long preferred to look outward, thus maintaining a dependence upon a vast hierarchy that stretches between the individual and the Divine. In all our wanderings away from the Divine, humankind has obscured its most compelling features through a persistent belief in limitations defined by the hierarchical structure of our world. The Divine dances outside of the confines of any hierarchical structures. It is complete within itself, and has a singular purpose of demonstrating the collective potential of all life within the universe. It is the archetype of perfection. It is the standard bearer of each soul's innate design and ultimate destiny. The essence of the Divine is so far beyond mental conception that humanity's tendency is to resort to the limiting language of hierarchical belief systems to define it. **The Hierarchical Paradigm: Searching for Connection and Wholeness** When people are unaware of their inner wisdom and wholeness, they search for order and security outside themselves. Uncertain of their place within the hierarchical order of the world, they tend to define themselves based upon their insecurities. Individuals thus become only pieces of their wholeness and like shards of glass from a beautiful vase, they bear little resemblance to their aggregate beauty. Within the hierarchy, many in high positions of power have taken advantage of our collective insecurities in attempting to guide the development of all humankind. They have obscured the", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:060113hierarchytointegration.txt:0:8d0816379be1", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 7522, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "060113hierarchytointegration.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "060113hierarchytointegration", "chunk_index": 1, "text": "for order and security outside themselves. Uncertain of their place within the hierarchical order of the world, they tend to define themselves based upon their insecurities. Individuals thus become only pieces of their wholeness and like shards of glass from a beautiful vase, they bear little resemblance to their aggregate beauty. Within the hierarchy, many in high positions of power have taken advantage of our collective insecurities in attempting to guide the development of all humankind. They have obscured the direct connection between the individual and the Divine through a variety of means designed to intercede between our inner essence and our divine source. Each individual can come to know themselves to be free of all forms of hierarchical control. This is not to imply that we should not trust others or join together in bonds of friendship and community. It is simply a reminder that relative truth is constantly shifting in the hands of those who desire to control. And even when the motive for their controlling behaviors may be of good will, it is still a form of control. When the revealers of \"truth\" within the hierarchy withhold and suppress information, they are usually positioned to acquire and maintain power rather than disseminating empowerment to all. The desire for connection and wholeness is a fuel that drives us to seek out and explore the hierarchical paradigm. This inner longing provides us with the motivation to seek help and guidance from a specific group within the hierarchy, and in so doing, cultivate a sense of belonging and connection. Furthermore, the hierarchical paradigm is a stage whereby we develop a sense of connection to some grand, encompassing vision. This is why the hierarchy nurtures prophets who point toward a greater vision. Spiritual leaders are able to peer deeply beneath the surface reality of life and experience how intricately connected every life form is, and how the composite of all life is intelligent far beyond measure. These visionary leaders can thus interpret reality through their personal abilities to perceive and express life's dimensional depth and limitless intelligence. Yet no one is able to articulate life's full dimensional depth and breadth with the tools of language. They can only, at best, describe their interpretation or their impressions. In actuality, all of us are able to peer beneath the surface reality of life and perceive a unique vision of the universe. We require only time and intention to develop our own interpretations. And this is precisely what many great spiritual leaders have taught. Life's deeper essence is not an absolute to be experienced by the chosen few, but an evolving, dynamic intelligence that wears as many faces as there are life forms. No group or people has the exclusive portal into the universe by which the Divine expresses itself in all its majesty. The portal is open and available to all, because the", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:060113hierarchytointegration.txt:1:7ec82a1f5ce9", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 7523, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "060113hierarchytointegration.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "060113hierarchytointegration", "chunk_index": 2, "text": "only time and intention to develop our own interpretations.

No group or people has the exclusive portal into the universe by which the Divine expresses itself in all its majesty. The portal is open and available to all, because the Divine is within all things. Those who are recognized as great prophets each produced a vision of the universe beyond what was currently defined by the hierarchy. Because their interpretations were articulated with authority and depth of insight, they became a target of debate among various groups in the hierarchy. This debate then created a polarity of belief. A sympathetic constituency emerged to defend and embellish their leader's interpretation, while established groups held it in contempt of previously held beliefs. Invariably, the leader's vision became confined and shaped into dogma by followers who desired to create a religion or sect. Thus, this infusion of fresh insight quietly receded into the hands of the hierarchy, where its deeper meaning was obscured by the very fact that it was incorporated into a massive structure that both protected and promoted it. **The Transformation Paradigm: Inner Wisdom and Understanding** A new paradigm is emerging that promotes a clear connection of individual consciousness to the compelling features of the Divine without the intervention of a hierarchy. This is when the fables and myths of history step into the light and become known as they were originally intended. This is the time when language will be transformed into a new form of communication that breaks down all barriers of control. Personal transformation, through the awakening of inner wisdom and understanding, is the pathway into wholeness. The transformation paradigm is initiated simply by the recognition that rather than the dependency-inducing ways of the hierarchical paradigm, there are accelerated, independent pathways that bypass the hierarchy and lead to self-mastery. These new pathways lead to the divine wisdom and understanding that is present within all of us. This wisdom can be accessed through the practice of three [principles of transformation](https://www.WantToKnow.info/transformation): seeing the Divine in all, nurturance of life, and gratitude. The application of these life principles disengages individuals from the controlling elements of the hierarchy, thus initiating the transformation experience. As there are relative truths, there are relative freedoms. As individuals evolve through the hierarchical process, an ever-increasing sense of freedom is gained, yet external forces continue to exert control through limiting language and confining belief systems. These controlling influences lead to continued reliance upon the hierarchy as it unceasingly attempts to impose a sense of inequality between us. The underlying equation of the hierarchical paradigm is: individual + hierarchy = God connection. In the case of personal transformation", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:060113hierarchytointegration.txt:2:8d07ca2fcced", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 7524, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "060113hierarchytointegration.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "060113hierarchytointegration", "chunk_index": 3, "text": "experience.

As individuals evolve through the hierarchical process, an ever-increasing sense of freedom is gained, yet external forces continue to exert control through limiting language and confining belief systems. These controlling influences lead to continued reliance upon the hierarchy as it unceasingly attempts to impose a sense of inequality between us. The underlying equation of the hierarchical paradigm is: individual + hierarchy = God connection. In the case of personal transformation it is: individual + inner wisdom and understanding = divine equality with all. **The Synthesis Paradigm: Integration ** For those who feel called, the time has come to integrate the dominant paradigm of the hierarchy with the expanding transformation paradigm. This integration occurs naturally once we have fully explored the two paradigms and develop a synthesis paradigm whereby transformation is attained by searching for connection and wholeness through our own inner wisdom and understanding. It is this combination of release from dependency on the hierarchy and transformation from within that initiates the synthesis paradigm. Once we take responsibility for our own transformation and integration, it does not mean that the hierarchy is to be shunned or avoided. The hierarchy is quite benign as a manipulative force and merely represents one important stage in the journey toward wholeness. What is being set in motion now is the initial preparation for these paradigm shifts. More specifically, these paradigms will be simultaneously played out over the coming years. As always, it will be the choice of each one of us as to which paradigm we embrace in our journey. All of the highest imaginings of humanity are yet unaware of our deepest foundation. We have sought the upper reaches of the building, yet remain unaware of the foundation's design. It is here, at the very core of existence that the Divine is bursting forth with its creative energy while simultaneously reintegrating with its invitation to wholeness. It is here that equality is realized, not in the lofty places of relative truth lodged in the hierarchy, but rather in the deepest part of the foundational plan of life's original source and ultimate destiny. The origin and destiny of existence is the tone of equality in life.

PSYOPS, or psychological operations, is a term used in military and government intelligence networks to \"exploit human vulnerabilities in enemy governments, militaries and populations to pursue national and battlefield objectives,\" as quoted from the *Washington Post* article copied below. Stated more simply, PSYOPS is a means of intentionally manipulating and deceiving targeted individuals and populations through a variety of sophisticated methods for specified objectives. Consider that all major countries have developed sophisticated PSYOPS programs such as those described below. Consider also that governments sometimes use PSYOPS technology to deceive their own people in order to achieve certain military or strategic objectives.

Arkin \"Gentlemen! We have called you together to inform you that we are going to overthrow the United States government.\" So begins a statement being delivered by Gen. Carl W. Steiner, former Commander-in-chief, U.S. Special Operations Command. At least the voice sounds amazingly like him. But it is not Steiner. It is the result of voice \"morphing\" technology developed at the Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico. **By taking just a 10-minute digital recording of Steiner's voice, scientist George Papcun is able, in near real time, to clone speech patterns and develop an accurate facsimile.** Steiner was so impressed, he asked for a copy of the tape.

Steiner was hardly the first or last victim to be spoofed by Papcun's team members. To refine their method, they took various high quality recordings of generals and experimented with creating fake statements. One of the most memorable is Colin Powell stating \"I am being treated well by my captors.\" \"They chose to have him say something he would never otherwise have said,\" chuckled one of Papcun's colleagues. **A Box of Chocolates is Like War** Most Americans were introduced to the tricks of the digital age in the movie Forrest Gump, when the character played by Tom Hanks appeared to shake hands with President Kennedy. For Hollywood, it is special effects. For covert operators in the U.S. military and intelligence agencies, it is a weapon of the future. \"Once you can take any kind of information and reduce it into ones and zeros, you can do some pretty interesting things,\" says Daniel T. Kuehl, chairman of the Information Operations department of the National Defense University in Washington, the military's school for information warfare. **Digital morphing - voice, video, and photo - has come of age, available for use in psychological operations. PSYOPS, as the military calls it, seek to exploit human vulnerabilities in enemy governments, militaries and populations to pursue national and battlefield objectives.** To some, PSYOPS is a backwater military discipline of leaflet dropping and radio propaganda. To a growing group of information war technologists, it is the nexus of fantasy and reality. Being able to manufacture convincing audio or video, they say, might be the difference in a successful military operation or coup. **Allah on the Holodeck** Pentagon planners started to discuss digital morphing after Iraq's invasion of Kuwait in 1990. **Covert operators kicked around the idea of creating a computer-faked videotape of Saddam Hussein crying or showing other such manly weaknesses, or in some sexually compromising situation.** The nascent plan was for the tapes to be flooded into Iraq and the Arab world. The tape war never proceeded, killed, participants say, by bureaucratic fights over jurisdiction, skepticism over the technology, and concerns raised by Arab coalition partners. But the \"strategic\" PSYOPS scheming didn't die. **What if the U.S. projected a holographic image of Allah floating over Baghdad urging the Iraqi people and Army to rise up against Saddam,** a senior Air Force officer asked in 1990?

But doing so over the skies of Iraq? To project such a hologram over Baghdad on the order of several hundred feet, they calculated, would take a mirror more than a mile square in space, as well as huge projectors and power sources. And besides, investigators came back, what does Allah look like? **The Gulf War hologram story might be dismissed were it not the case that washingtonpost.com has learned that a super secret program was established in 1994 to pursue the very technology for PSYOPS application. The \"Holographic Projector\" is described in a classified Air Force document as a system to \"project information power from space ... for special operations deception missions.\" ** **War is Like a Box of Chocolate** Voice-morphing? Fake video? Holographic projection? They sound more like Mission Impossible and Star Trek gimmicks than weapons. Yet for each, there are corresponding and growing research efforts as the technologies improve and offensive information warfare expands. Whereas early voice morphing required cutting and pasting speech to put letters or words together to make a composite, Papcun's software developed at Los Alamos can far more accurately replicate the way one actually speaks. Eliminated are the robotic intonations. The irony is that after Papcun finished his speech cloning research, there were no takers in the military. Luckily for him, Hollywood is interested: The promise of creating a virtual Clark Gable is mightier than the sword. Video and photo manipulation has already raised profound questions of authenticity for the journalistic world. With audio joining the mix, it is not only journalists but also privacy advocates and the conspiracy-minded who will no doubt ponder the worrisome mischief that lurks in the not too distant future. \"We already know that seeing isn't necessarily believing,\" says Dan Kuehl, \"now I guess hearing isn't either.\" *William M.

[White House Erodes Open Government](http://www.projectcensored.org/censored_2006/#1) ** While the White House has expanded its ability to keep tabs on civilians, it's been working to curtail the ability of the public-and even Congress-to find out what the government is doing. One year ago, Rep. Henry A. Waxman, D-Calif., released an 81-page analysis of how the administration has administered the country's major open government laws. The report found that **the feds consistently \"narrowed the scope and application\" of the Freedom of Information Act, the Presidential Records Act and other key public-information legislation, while expanding laws blocking access to certain records-even creating new categories of \"protected\" information and exempting entire departments from public scrutiny.** When those methods haven't been enough, the administration has simply refused to release records-even when requested by a congressional subcommittee or the Government Accountability Office. Given the news media's interest in safeguarding open government laws, one wonders why these findings weren't publicized far and wide. **Source:** \"[New Report Details Bush Administration Secrecy](http://www.commondreams.org/news2004/0914-05.htm)\" press release, Karen Lightfoot, Government Reform Minority Office, posted on [www.commondreams.org](http://www.commondreams.org/), Sept. 14, 2004. **2.

U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights Louise Arbour called for an investigation into whether the Americans and their allies had engaged in \"the deliberate targeting of civilians, indiscriminate and disproportionate attacks, the killing of injured persons, and the use of human shields,\" among other possible \"grave breaches of the Geneva Conventions\" considered war crimes under federal law. More than 83 percent of Fallujah's 300,000 residents fled the city. Men between the ages of 15 and 45 were refused safe passage, and all who remained-about 50,000-were treated as enemy combatants. **Numerous sources reported that coalition forces cut off water and electricity, shot at anyone who ventured out into the open, executed families waving white flags while trying to swim across the Euphrates, shot at ambulances, and allowed corpses to rot in the streets and be eaten by dogs. **Medical staff reported seeing people with melted faces and limbs, injuries consistent with the use of phosphorous bombs.

Then came Nov. 2, 2004. President Bush prevailed by 3 million votes-despite exit polls that projected John Kerry winning by a margin of 5 million. \"Exit polls are highly accurate,\" wrote Professor Steve Freeman of the University of Pennsylvania's Center for Organizational Dynamics in an article co-authored with statistician Josh Mitteldorf of Temple University. \"They remove most of the sources of potential polling error by identifying actual voters and asking them immediately afterward who they had voted for.\" **The discrepancy of **8 million votes** was well beyond the poll's recognized margin of error** of less than one percent**.

[Surveillance Society Quietly Moves In](http://www.projectcensored.org/censored_2006/#4)** It's a well-known dirty trick in the halls of government: If you want to pass unpopular legislation that you know won't stand up to scrutiny, just wait until the public isn't looking. That's precisely what the White House did Dec. 13, 2003, the day American troops captured Saddam Hussein. President Bush celebrated the occasion by privately signing into law the Intelligence Authorization Act-a controversial expansion of the PATRIOT Act that included items culled from the \"Domestic Security Enhancement Act of 2003,\" a draft proposal that had been shelved due to a public outcry after being leaked. **Specifically, the IAA allows the government to obtain an individual's financial records without a court order. The law also makes it illegal for institutions to inform anyone that the government has requested those records, or that information has been shared with the authorities.** The law also broadens the definition of \"financial institution\" to include insurance companies, travel and real estate agencies, stockbrokers, the U.S. Postal Service, jewelry stores, casinos, airlines, car dealerships, and any other business \"whose cash transactions have a high degree of usefulness in criminal, tax or regulatory matters.\" In one fell swoop, this act has decimated our rights to privacy, due process, and freedom of speech. **Sources:** \"[PATRIOT Act's Reach Expanded Despite Part Being Struck Down](http://www.allbusiness.com/periodicals/article/764097-1.html),\" Nikki Swartz, *Information Management Journal,* March/April 2004; \"Grave New World,\" Anna Samson Miranda, [*LiP,*Winter 2004](http://www.clamormagazine.com/Merchant2/merchant.mvc?Screen=PROD&Product_Code=LIP2&Category_Code=ISSUES&Store_Code=LiP); \"[Where Big Brother Snoops on Americans 24/7](http://www.capitolhillblue.com/cgi-bin/artman/exec/view.cgi?archive=32&num=4648),\" Teresa Hampton, [www.capitolhillblue.com](http://www.capitolhillblue.com/), June 7, 2004. **5.

[The Real Oil for Food Scam](http://www.projectcensored.org/censored_2006/#6)** The United Nations allegedly allowed Saddam Hussein to rake in $10 billion in illegal cash through the Oil for Food program. *New York Times* columnist William Safire referred to the alleged U.N. con game as \"the richest rip-off in world history.\" According to the GAO, Hussein smuggled $6 billion worth of oil out of Iraq-most of it through the Persian Gulf. **Yet most of the oil that left Iraq by land did so through Jordan and Turkey-with the approval of the United States.** The first Bush administration informally exempted Jordan from the ban on purchasing Iraqi oil-an arrangement that provided Hussein with $4.4 billion over 10 years, according to the CIA's own findings. The U.S. later allowed Iraq to leak another $710 million worth of oil through Turkey, all while U.S. planes enforcing no-fly zones flew overhead. Scott Ritter, a U.N. weapons inspector in Iraq during the first six years of economic sanctions against the country, unearthed yet another scam: The United States allegedly allowed an oil company run by Russian foreign minister Yevgeny Primakov's sister to purchase cheap oil from Iraq and resell it to U.S. companies at market value-purportedly earning Hussein \"hundreds of millions\" more. **Sources:** \"[The UN Is Us: Exposing Saddam Hussein's Silent Partner](http://www.harpers.org/TheUNIsUs.html),\" Joy Gordon, *Harper's,* December 2004; \"[The Oil for Food 'Scandal' Is a Cynical Smokescreen](http://www.commondreams.org/views04/1212-23.htm),\" Scott Ritter, *UK Independent,* Dec. 12, 2004. **7.

As far as anyone has yet proved, no commanding officer ever ordered a subordinate to fire on journalists.

Meanwhile, the interim government the United States installed in Iraq raided and closed down Al-Jazeera's Baghdad offices almost as soon as it took power and banned the network from doing any reporting in the country. In November, the interim government ordered news organizations to \"stick to the government line on the U.S.-led offensive in Fallujah or face legal action,\" in an official command sent out on interim prime minister Eyad Allawi's letterhead. **Sources:** \"[Dead Messengers: How the US Military Threatens Journalists](http://www.truthout.org/docs_2005/022405A.shtml),\" Steve Weissman, [www.truthout.org](http://www.truthout.org/), Feb. 28, 2005; \"[Media Repression in 'Liberated' Land](http://www.ipsnews.net/interna.asp?idnews=26333),\" Dahr Jamail, Inter Press Service, Nov. 18, 2004. **8.

Native varieties will be replaced by foreign-and genetically engineered-seeds. Order 81 fit nicely into the outlines of a U.S. \"Economy Plan,\" a 101-page blueprint for the economic makeover of Iraq, formulated with ample help from corporate lobbyists.

Part of that interest is clearly Iran's nuclear program-but there may be more to the story. One bit of news that hasn't received the public attention it merits is Iran's declared intent to open an international oil exchange market, or \"bourse.\" Not only would the new entity compete against the New York Mercantile Exchange and London's International Petroleum Exchange (both owned by American corporations), but it would also ignite international oil trading in euros. **A shift away from U.S. dollars to euros in the oil market would cause the demand for petrodollars to drop, perhaps causing the value of the dollar to plummet*. ***Russia, Venezuela and some members of OPEC have expressed interest in moving towards a petroeuro system. And it isn't entirely implausible that China, which is the world's second largest holder of U.S. currency reserves, might eventually follow suit. Barring a U.S. attack, it appears imminent that Iran's euro-dominated oil bourse will open in March 2006. Logically, the most appropriate U.S. strategy is compromise with the EU and OPEC towards a dual-currency system for international oil trades.

It was obtained by the [National Security Archive](http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/NSAEBB/NSAEBB177/index.htm) at George Washington University using the Freedom of Information Act. **Officials in the Pentagon wrote it in 2003. The Secretary of Defense, Donald Rumsfeld, signed it. ** The \"roadmap\" calls for a far-reaching overhaul of the military's ability to conduct information operations and electronic warfare.

And, in some detail, it makes recommendations for how the US armed forces should think about this new, virtual warfare. The document says that information is \"critical to military success\". Computer and telecommunications networks are of vital operational importance. **Propaganda** **The operations described in the document include a surprising range of military activities: public affairs officers who brief journalists, psychological operations troops who try to manipulate the thoughts and beliefs of an enemy, computer network attack specialists who seek to destroy enemy networks.** All these are engaged in information operations. **Perhaps the most startling aspect of the roadmap is its acknowledgement that information put out as part of the military's psychological operations, or [Psyops](https://www.WantToKnow.info/060123psyops), is finding its way onto the computer and television screens of ordinary Americans. ** \"Information intended for foreign audiences, including public diplomacy and Psyops, is increasingly consumed by our domestic audience,\" it reads. **\"Psyops messages will often be replayed by the news media for much larger audiences, including the American public,**\" it goes on. The document's authors acknowledge that American news media should not unwittingly broadcast military propaganda. \"Specific boundaries should be established,\" they write. But they don't seem to explain how. \"In this day and age it is impossible to prevent stories that are fed abroad as part of psychological operations propaganda from blowing back into the United States - even though they were directed abroad,\" says Kristin Adair of the National Security Archive. **Credibility problem** Public awareness of the US military's information operations is low, but it's growing - thanks to some operational clumsiness. **Late last year, it emerged that the Pentagon had paid a private company, the Lincoln Group, to plant hundreds of stories in Iraqi newspapers. The stories - all supportive of US policy - were written by military personnel and then placed in Iraqi publications. ** **And websites that appeared to be information sites on the politics of Africa and the Balkans were found to be run by the Pentagon. ** But the true extent of the Pentagon's information operations, how they work, who they're aimed at, and at what point they turn from informing the public to influencing populations, is far from clear. The roadmap, however, gives a flavour of what the US military is up to - and the grand scale on which it's thinking. It reveals that Psyops personnel \"support\" the American government's international broadcasting. It singles out TV Marti - a station which broadcasts to Cuba - as receiving such support.

It reveals that Psyops personnel \"support\" the American government's international broadcasting. It singles out TV Marti - a station which broadcasts to Cuba - as receiving such support. It recommends that a global website be established that supports America's strategic objectives. But no American diplomats here, thank you. The website would use content from \"third parties with greater credibility to foreign audiences than US officials\". It also recommends that Psyops personnel should consider a range of technologies to disseminate propaganda in enemy territory: unmanned aerial vehicles, \"miniaturized, scatterable public address systems\", wireless devices, cellular phones and the internet. **'Fight the net'** When it describes plans for electronic warfare, or EW, the document takes on an extraordinary tone. It seems to see the internet as being equivalent to an enemy weapons system. **\"Strategy should be based on the premise that the Department [of Defense] will 'fight the net' as it would an enemy weapons system,\" it reads. ** **The slogan \"fight the net\" appears several times throughout the roadmap. ** The authors warn that US networks are very vulnerable to attack by hackers, enemies seeking to disable them, or spies looking for intelligence. \"Networks are growing faster than we can defend them... Attack sophistication is increasing... Number of events is increasing.\" **US digital ambition** **And, in a grand finale, the document recommends that the United States should seek the ability to \"provide maximum control of the entire electromagnetic spectrum\". ** **US forces should be able to \"disrupt or destroy the full spectrum of globally emerging communications systems, sensors, and weapons systems dependent on the electromagnetic spectrum\". ** Consider that for a moment. The US military seeks the capability to knock out every telephone, every networked computer, every radar system on the planet. Are these plans the pipe dreams of self-aggrandising bureaucrats? Or are they real? **The fact that the \"Information Operations Roadmap\" is approved by the Secretary of Defense suggests that these plans are taken very seriously indeed in the Pentagon. ** And that the scale and grandeur of the digital revolution is matched only by the US military's ambitions for it. ** Note:** You can view the entire 78-page U.S. military document titled \"Information Operations Roadmap\" (parts are redacted) on BBC's website at the link below.

Holeman](http://awakenvisions.com) **The Web of Love is an energetic web which connects the sacred essence of all beings in our world.** In the deepest part of ourselves, there is in each of us a beautiful, [divine essence](https://www.weboflove.org/transformation#seeing) which wants nothing more than [to love and be loved](https://www.momentoflove.org). The Web of Love, though invisible to our eyes, interconnects all of us through that deepest essence. It literally surrounds and envelops our planet and all who live here. We are all interconnected through sacred love. It is up to each of us how much we choose to be aware of this connection. We are all capable of giving and receiving limitless amounts of love. Many of us have forgotten this and ended up feeling alone or uncared for in our lives. **The Web of Love reminds us of our true nature. It is a call to join together in sharing the abundance of sacred love that flows within and between us all** through consciously connecting with the web. **Connecting with the Web of Love** **Breathing the Web.** Here is a simple, yet powerful way of connecting with the Web of Love through breath. Close your eyes for a minute and imagine a sparkling, colorful web connecting the deepest essence of all people in the world. You can place your hands over your heart or the center of your chest as you do this. Take a few deep breaths as you open to this beautiful image. Now, while taking a slow, very deep inhale, silently say to yourself: **Your sacred love flows in to me** Then slowly exhale fully while thinking and feeling: **My sacred love flows out to you.** Repeat this a few times while opening your heart to all the love present.

Make sure to fill your lungs completely on the in breath and to exhale fully on breathing out. Breathing sacred love like this for just a minute or less can powerfully shift you into a more open and loving space. Try it now, and invite yourself to really let the love flow. The \"you\" in these sacred love statements can be all people in our world, or any individual you choose. For some, it might be easier to start by imagining the one to whom you feel closest in your life. Breathe the web with that special someone in mind and let the love flow between you. Then with each following breath, envision other people in your life and do the same. When you are ready, envision groups with which you are involved and eventually all people who share our world. This simple breathing exercise can be deeply meaningful in either a personal or a global context. Consider [joining with other caring people](http://doasone.com/BreathingRooms.aspx?RoomID=1) around the world in doing this. There may be times when you want to breathe the web, but can't remember the words above. \"Love to me, love to you,\" is all you need to feel the web as you breathe. You can create your own sayings, too, with words that are more meaningful to you. **The most important element is your intention to connect with all people on this beautiful planet through the Web of Love.** **Bringing the Web of Love into the World** If you are ready to powerfully transform your life, consider taking the Web of Love into your every day world. You might start your day upon awakening and end your day before sleeping with the above exercise. As you start your work, or whenever you feel stressed, take a minute to stop and deeply breathe in the ever present sacred love of the web and of everyone around you. Then on the exhale, fully breathe your sacred love out to all. You can do it with your eyes open or closed. Silently breathe the web while waiting at a traffic stoplight, with the checker at the store, or as you pass someone on the street.

Choosing either to gaze into each other's eyes or to keep your eyes closed, feel the love while breathing deeply together: Your sacred love flows in to me. My sacred love flows out to you. It doesn't matter that you might be breathing love in or out at the same time. Just let it flow in whatever way feels best. Once you feel complete, don't forget to take a minute to join in sharing the sacred love you've just generated with all beings on the planet.

One time I arrived in the middle of the night for a pick up at a building that was dark except for a single light in a ground floor window. Under these circumstances, many drivers would just honk once or twice, wait a minute, then drive away. But I had seen too many impoverished people who depended on taxis as their only means of transportation. Unless a situation smelled of danger, I always went to the door. This passenger might be someone who needs my assistance, I reasoned to myself. So I walked to the door and knocked. \"Just a minute,\" answered a frail, elderly voice. I could hear something being dragged across the floor. After a long pause, the door opened. A small woman in her 80's stood before me. She was wearing a print dress and a pillbox hat with a veil pinned on it, like somebody out of a 1940s movie. By her side was a small nylon suitcase. The apartment looked as if no one had lived in it for years. All the furniture was covered with sheets. There were no clocks on the walls, no knickknacks or utensils on the counters. In the corner was a cardboard box filled with photos and glassware. \"Would you carry my bag out to the car?\" she said. I took the suitcase to the cab, then returned to assist the woman. She took my arm and we walked slowly toward the curb. She kept thanking me for my kindness. \"It's nothing,\" I told her. \"I just try to treat my passengers the way I would want my mother treated.\" \"Oh, you're such a good boy,\" she said. When we got in the cab, she gave me an address, then asked, \"Could you drive through downtown?\" \"It's not the shortest way,\" I answered quickly. \"Oh, I don't mind,\" she said. \"I'm in no hurry. I'm on my way to a hospice.\" I looked in the rear view mirror. Her eyes were glistening. \"I don't have any family left,\" she continued. \"The doctor says I don't have very long.\" I quietly reached over and shut off the meter. \"What route would you like me to take?\" I asked. For the next two hours, we drove through the city. She showed me the building where she had once worked as an elevator operator. We drove through the neighborhood where she and her husband had lived when they were newlyweds. She had me pull up in front of a furniture warehouse that had once been a ballroom where she had gone dancing as a girl. Sometimes she'd ask me to slow in front of a particular building or corner and would sit staring into the darkness, saying", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:060309cabride.txt:0:2d06c66b495d", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 7549, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "060309cabride.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "060309cabride", "chunk_index": 1, "text": "through the city.

She had me pull up in front of a furniture warehouse that had once been a ballroom where she had gone dancing as a girl. Sometimes she'd ask me to slow in front of a particular building or corner and would sit staring into the darkness, saying nothing. As the first hint of sun was creasing the horizon, she suddenly said, \"I'm tired. Let's go now.\" We drove in silence to the address she had given me. It was a low building, like a small convalescent home, with a driveway that passed under a portico. Two orderlies came out to the cab as soon as we pulled up. They were solicitous and intent, watching her every move. They must have been expecting her. I opened the trunk and took the small suitcase to the door. The woman was already seated in a wheelchair. \"How much do I owe you?\" she asked, reaching into her purse. \"Nothing,\" I said. \"You have to make a living,\" she answered. \"There are other passengers.\" Almost without thinking, I bent and gave her a hug. She held onto me tightly. \"You gave an old woman a little moment of joy,\" she said. \"Thank you.\" I squeezed her hand, then walked into the dim morning light. Behind me, a door shut. It was the sound of the closing of a life. I didn't pick up any more passengers that shift. I drove aimlessly, lost in thought. For the rest of that day, I could hardly talk. What if that woman had gotten an angry driver, or one who was impatient to end his shift? What if I had refused to take the run, or had honked once, then driven away? On a quick review, I don't think that I have done anything more important in my life. We're conditioned to think that our lives revolve around great moments. But great moments often catch us unaware-beautifully wrapped in what others may consider a small one. **Note:** For more inspiring writing by Kent Nerburn, see his beautiful website: [http://kentnerburn.com](http://kentnerburn.com/about).

The latest plan, obtained by Newsnight from the US State Department was, we learned, drafted with the help of American oil industry consultants. **Insiders told Newsnight that planning began \"within weeks\" of Bush's first taking office in 2001, long before the September 11th attack on the US. ** An Iraqi-born oil industry consultant, Falah Aljibury, says he took part in the secret meetings in California, Washington and the Middle East. He described a State Department plan for a forced coup d'etat. Mr Aljibury himself told Newsnight that he interviewed potential successors to Saddam Hussein on behalf of the Bush administration. **Secret sell-off plan** The industry-favoured plan was pushed aside by a secret plan, drafted just before the invasion in 2003, which called for the sell-off of all of Iraq's oil fields. **The new plan was crafted by neo-conservatives intent on using Iraq's oil to destroy the Opec cartel through massive increases in production above Opec quotas. ** The sell-off was given the green light in a secret meeting in London headed by Fadhil Chalabi shortly after the US entered Baghdad, according to Robert Ebel.

Mr Ebel, a former Energy and CIA oil analyst, now a fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, told Newsnight he flew to the London meeting at the request of the State Department. Mr Aljibury, once Ronald Reagan's \"back-channel\" to Saddam, claims that plans to sell off Iraq's oil, pushed by the US-installed Governing Council in 2003, helped instigate the insurgency and attacks on US and British occupying forces. \"Insurgents used this, saying, 'Look, you're losing your country, you're losing your resources to a bunch of wealthy billionaires who want to take you over and make your life miserable,'\" said Mr Aljibury from his home near San Francisco. \"We saw an increase in the bombing of oil facilities, pipelines, built on the premise that privatisation is coming.\" **Privatisation blocked by industry** **Philip Carroll, the former CEO of Shell Oil USA who took control of Iraq's oil production for the US Government a month after the invasion, stalled the sell-off scheme. ** Mr Carroll told us he made it clear to Paul Bremer, the US occupation chief who arrived in Iraq in May 2003, that: \"There was to be no privatisation of Iraqi oil resources or facilities while I was involved.\" Ariel Cohen, of the neo-conservative Heritage Foundation, told Newsnight that an opportunity had been missed to privatise Iraq's oil fields. He advocated the plan as a means to help the US defeat Opec, and said America should have gone ahead with what he called a \"no-brainer\" decision. Mr Carroll hit back, telling Newsnight, \"I would agree with that statement. To privatize would be a no-brainer. It would only be thought about by someone with no brain.\" **New plans, obtained from the State Department by Newsnight and Harper's Magazine under the US Freedom of Information Act, called for creation of a state-owned oil company favoured by the US oil industry.** It was completed in January 2004 under the guidance of Amy Jaffe of the James Baker Institute in Texas. **Formerly US Secretary of State, Baker is now an attorney representing Exxon-Mobil and the Saudi Arabian government. ** [**View segments of Iraq oil plans at www.GregPalast.com**](http://www.gregpalast.com/opeconthemarch.html) Questioned by Newsnight, Ms Jaffe said the oil industry prefers state control of Iraq's oil over a sell-off because it fears a repeat of Russia's energy privatisation.

The time I saw a soldier broken down inside because he killed a child, or an old man on his knees, crying with his arms raised to the sky, perhaps asking God why we had taken the lifeless body of his son. I thought of the suffering of a people whose country was in ruins and who were further humiliated by the raids, patrols and curfews of an occupying army. **And I realized that none of the reasons we were told about why we were in Iraq turned out to be true.** There were no weapons of mass destruction. There was no link between Saddam Hussein and al Qaeda. We weren't helping the Iraqi people and the Iraqi people didn't want us there. We weren't preventing terrorism or making Americans safer. **Coming home gave me the clarity to see the line between military duty and moral obligation.** I realized that I was part of a war that I believed was immoral and criminal.

By putting my weapon down, I chose to reassert myself as a human being. I have not deserted the military nor been disloyal to the men and women of the military.** I have not been disloyal to a country. I have only been loyal to my principles.** When I turned myself in, with all my fears and doubts, I did it not only for myself. I did it for the people of Iraq, even for those who fired upon me - they were just on the other side of a battleground where war itself was the only enemy. I did it for the Iraqi children, who are victims of mines and depleted uranium. I did it for the thousands of unknown civilians killed in war. My time in prison is a small price compared to the price Iraqis and Americans have paid with their lives. Mine is a small price compared to the price humanity has paid for war. **Many have called me a coward, others have called me a hero. I believe I can be found somewhere in the middle. To those who have called me a hero, I say that I don't believe in heroes, but I believe that ordinary people can do extraordinary things.** To those who have called me a coward I say that they are wrong, and that without knowing it, they are also right. They are wrong when they think that I left the war for fear of being killed. I admit that fear was there, but there was also the fear of killing innocent people, the fear of putting myself in a position where to survive means to kill. There was the fear of losing my soul in the process of saving my body, the fear of losing myself to my daughter, to the people who love me, to the man I used to be, the man I wanted to be. I was afraid of waking up one morning to realize my humanity had abandoned me.

I failed to fulfill my moral duty as a human being and instead I chose to fulfill my duty as a soldier. All because I was afraid. I was terrified; I did not want to stand up to the government and the army - I was afraid of punishment and humiliation. I went to war because at the moment I was a coward, and for that I apologize to my soldiers for not being the type of leader I should have been. I also apologize to the Iraqi people. To them I say I am sorry for the curfews, for the raids, for the killings. May they find it in their hearts to forgive me. One of the reasons I did not refuse the war from the beginning was that I was afraid of losing my freedom. **Today, as I sit behind bars I realize that there are many types of freedom, and that in spite of my confinement I remain free in many important ways. What good is freedom if we are afraid to follow our conscience? What good is freedom if we are not able to live with our own actions? I am confined to a prison but I feel, today more than ever, connected to all humanity. Behind these bars I sit a free man because I listened to a higher power, the voice of my conscience.** *In March of 2004, 28-year-old Sgt.

The time I saw a soldier broken down inside because he killed a child, or an old man on his knees, crying with his arms raised to the sky, perhaps asking God why we had taken the lifeless body of his son. I thought of the suffering of a people whose country was in ruins and who were further humiliated by the raids, patrols and curfews of an occupying army. **And I realized that none of the reasons we were told about why we were in Iraq turned out to be true.** There were no weapons of mass destruction. There was no link between Saddam Hussein and al Qaeda. We weren't helping the Iraqi people and the Iraqi people didn't want us there. We weren't preventing terrorism or making Americans safer. I couldn't find a single good reason for having been there, for having shot at people and been shot at. **Coming home gave me the clarity to see the line between military duty and moral obligation.** I realized that I was part of a war that I believed was immoral and criminal, a war of aggression, a war of imperial domination.

I realized that acting upon my principles became incompatible with my role in the military, and I decided that I could not return to Iraq. By putting my weapon down, I chose to reassert myself as a human being. I have not deserted the military nor been disloyal to the men and women of the military.** I have not been disloyal to a country. I have only been loyal to my principles.** When I turned myself in, with all my fears and doubts, I did it not only for myself. I did it for the people of Iraq, even for those who fired upon me - they were just on the other side of a battleground where war itself was the only enemy. I did it for the Iraqi children, who are victims of mines and depleted uranium. I did it for the thousands of unknown civilians killed in war. My time in prison is a small price compared to the price Iraqis and Americans have paid with their lives. Mine is a small price compared to the price humanity has paid for war. **Many have called me a coward, others have called me a hero. I believe I can be found somewhere in the middle. To those who have called me a hero, I say that I don't believe in heroes, but I believe that ordinary people can do extraordinary things.** To those who have called me a coward I say that they are wrong, and that without knowing it, they are also right. They are wrong when they think that I left the war for fear of being killed. I admit that fear was there, but there was also the fear of killing innocent people, the fear of putting myself in a position where to survive means to kill, there was the fear of losing my soul in the process of saving my body, the fear of losing myself to my daughter, to the people who love me, to the man I used to be, the man I wanted to be. I was afraid of waking up one morning to realize my humanity had abandoned me.

I was a coward not for leaving the war, but for having been a part of it in the first place. Refusing and resisting this war was my moral duty, a moral duty that called me to take a principled action. I failed to fulfill my moral duty as a human being and instead I chose to fulfill my duty as a soldier. All because I was afraid. I was terrified; I did not want to stand up to the government and the army - I was afraid of punishment and humiliation. I went to war because at the moment I was a coward, and for that I apologize to my soldiers for not being the type of leader I should have been. I also apologize to the Iraqi people. To them I say I am sorry for the curfews, for the raids, for the killings. May they find it in their hearts to forgive me. One of the reasons I did not refuse the war from the beginning was that I was afraid of losing my freedom. **Today, as I sit behind bars I realize that there are many types of freedom, and that in spite of my confinement I remain free in many important ways. What good is freedom if we are afraid to follow our conscience? What good is freedom if we are not able to live with our own actions? I am confined to a prison but I feel, today more than ever, connected to all humanity. Behind these bars I sit a free man because I listened to a higher power, the voice of my conscience.** *In March 2004, 28-year-old Sgt. Camilo Mejia turned himself in to the U.S. military and filed an application for conscientious objector status. On May 21, he was sentenced to one year in prison for refusing to return to fight in Iraq. He was released from prison on Feb. 15, 2005. The above letter was written while he was in prison. * **Kindly support this work: [Donate here](https://www.WantToKnow.info/donationswtk.php).** Explore the mind and heart expanding websites managed by the nonprofit PEERS network: [www.peerservice.org](https://www.peerservice.org) - PEERS websites: Spreading inspiration, education, & empowerment [www.momentoflove.org](https://www.momentoflove.org) - Every person in the world has a heart [www.personalgrowthcourses.net](https://www.personalgrowthcourses.net) - Dynamic online courses powerfully expand your horizons [www.WantToKnow.info](https://www.WantToKnow.info) - Reliable, verifiable information on major cover-ups [www.weboflove.org](https://www.weboflove.org) - Strengthening the Web of Love that interconnects us all [Subscribe/Unsubscribe/Change email address](https://www.WantToKnow.info/subscribe): The WantToKnow.info email list (two messages a week) Inspirational Stories", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:060323soldierasksforgiveness.txt:2:afd8a650dd1f", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 7561, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "060324cnnquestions911.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "060324cnnquestions911", "chunk_index": 0, "text": "9/11 Questions **9/11 Questions CNN Reports Overwhelming Response to 9/11 Story, Airs More Unanswered Questions ** **\"It's been pretty hard to believe the response we got today to the incredible story Showbiz Tonight broke last night, after Charlie Sheens' startling claims that the government may be covering up what really happened on 9/11.

A link to a clip from this revealing interview even showed up in two places on the CNN homepage. For the following night's show, **host A.J. Hammer stated that the response to Sheen's statements was so overwhelming that they decided to get more riveting information by bringing in Alex Jones, the fringe radio personality who had originally interviewed Sheen.** Though Mr. Jones has a tendency to be somewhat angry and blaming, I have known of him for years, and he has done some very respectable investigative work on major cover-ups other people will not touch. Many of us who have spent long hours investigating unanswered 9/11 questions believe that once the media starts playing their role to educate the public on these vital matters, people will unite to demand accountability and the release of vast amounts of documents and videos the government is concealing. For the first time, CNN is now playing that role in a big way. **We encourage you to contact CNN to show your support by contacting them at [http://www.cnn.com/feedback/forms/form5c.html?23](http://www.cnn.com/feedback/forms/form5c.html?23).** To hear the interview with Alex Jones and for reliable, verifiable information on unanswered 9/11 questions discussed on both shows, see below.

I and many others in the research network in which I am involved have found that **a key difficulty we face in building a better world is the resistance of many people to looking at some of the darker aspects of what is going both in the world and inside of ourselves.** I invite you to consider that by avoiding or suppressing the darker aspects of life, we only give them room to grow even darker and more threatening. By choosing to pull back the veil and look directly into the darkness, by choosing to face both our individual and collective fears and working to transform them, we can improve not only our own lives, but our entire world. I present the information below out of a desire to invite all of us draw back the veils and awaken to the deeper potential that lies within all of us to play an important role in transforming our world into a more caring, supportive place to live. **If you can give just a few minutes of your time, I invite you to open to a crucial piece of what is going on behind the veil by watching the most popular documentary on 9/11.

See, it is very likely that you already know that Sept. 11 will go down in the conspiracy history books as a far more sinister affair than, say, the murky swirl of the Kennedy assassination. **You probably already know that much of what exactly happened on Sept. 11 remains deeply unsettling and largely unsolved -- or to put another way, if you *don't* know all of this and if you fully and blithely accept the official Sept. 11 story, well, you haven't been paying close enough attention. ** But on this, the third anniversary of the launch of Bush's illegal invasion of Iraq by way of whoring the tragedy of Sept. 11 for his cronies' appalling gain, what you might not", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:060407bestdocumentary9-11.txt:2:434a1bb338f8", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 7569, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "060407bestdocumentary9-11.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "060407bestdocumentary9-11", "chunk_index": 3, "text": "of what exactly happened on Sept. 11 remains deeply unsettling and largely unsolved -- or to put another way, if you *don't* know all of this and if you fully and blithely accept the official Sept. 11 story, well, you haven't been paying close enough attention. ** But on this, the third anniversary of the launch of Bush's illegal invasion of Iraq by way of whoring the tragedy of Sept. 11 for his cronies' appalling gain, what you might not know, **what gets so easily forgotten in the mists of time and via the endless repetition of the orthodox Sept. 11 tale, is the sheer volume, the staggering array of unanswered questions about just about every single aspect of Sept. 11 ** -- the planes, the WTC towers, the Pentagon, the fires, the passengers and the cell phone calls and the firefighters and, well, just about everything. It is, when you look closely, all merely a matter of how far down the rabbit hole you are willing to go. Verily, Jacobson, in his New York mag piece, encounters crackpots and fringe nutballs and those who think Sept. 11 was connected to aliens and electromagnetic fields and the Illuminati. It can, unfortunately, get a little crazy. But there is also a very smart, grounded, intelligent and surprisingly large faction -- which includes eyewitnesses, Sept. 11 widows, former generals, pilots, professors, engineers, WTC maintenance workers and many, many more -- who point to a rather shocking pile of evidence that says there is simply no way 19 fanatics with box cutters sent by some bearded lunatic in a cave could have pulled off the most perfectly orchestrated air attack of the century. Not without serious help, anyway. Whose help? This, of course, is the biggest question of all, one which many of the more well-researched theories go a surprisingly long way toward answering. You have to sift and sort. There are disturbing questions about collapse speeds and controlled demolitions and why the towers fell when the all-steel infrastructure was designed to easily withstand the temperatures of any sort of fire, even burning jet fuel. There are questions of the mysterious, media-documented blasts deep in the WTC towers that took place *after* the planes hit. There are questions of why there was such a short-selling spree on shares of American Airlines and United Air Lines the day before the attack, huge doubts about the failures of NORAD and the FAA, the bizarre case of the missing plane in the Pentagon crash, and also the downing of Flight 93 where, according to the coroner, no blood or major plane wreckage was actually found. **There is, ultimately, the stunning failure of the entire multi-trillion-dollar American air-defense system. Just for starters. ** **There is also the very big question of what happened to 7 WTC, the only building not hit by anything at all, but which", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:060407bestdocumentary9-11.txt:3:f5bfd28ff97c", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 7570, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "060407bestdocumentary9-11.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "060407bestdocumentary9-11", "chunk_index": 4, "text": "the failures of NORAD and the FAA, the bizarre case of the missing plane in the Pentagon crash, and also the downing of Flight 93 where, according to the coroner, no blood or major plane wreckage was actually found. **There is, ultimately, the stunning failure of the entire multi-trillion-dollar American air-defense system.

About three weeks ago, a good friend and fellow interpreter left a phone message asking if I was interested in doing a short interpreting assignment with him in Indonesia. **We would be interpreting at a two-day safety training for offshore oil rig workers in the port city of Balikpapan on the east side of the island of Borneo.** Because I've been intensely focused on the powerful inspiration and transformation work through the websites in which I'm involved, I hadn't done any interpreting work in two years. Upon receiving this invitation, I wasn't sure I wanted to take the work. The $800/day pay rate certainly had an appeal, especially as I've earned virtually nothing in the past two years. A trip to Indonesia and the opportunity to keep up on my Indonesian language skills would also be a plus. Yet I also had a long list of exciting things waiting to be done on the websites I manage. And I was not sure that working for an oil company-even if it was a safety training-was in alignment with my deep commitment to transformation. **I was about to call my friend to decline his offer, but as I reached to pick up the phone, something inside me said wait a minute.** So I put the phone down, opened to divine guidance, and checked in deeply with myself. Setting aside all money and Internet work considerations, I asked myself \"do I really want to go?\" A voice from within gave a clear yes. I realized that I have missed the wonderful people and culture of Indonesia, and I love working as an interpreter. This would actually be a wonderful chance both to take a short break from the Internet work, and to get back into interpreting and the Indonesian culture just for these few days. By the time I found myself on the plane back home, I was amazed at what I had experienced on this brief trip. The training was one of the best I've ever seen. Two wonderful instructors taught these oil rig workers simple, yet very empowering communication skills which they practiced on the spot with their co-workers. Rank and even racial issues between the Indonesians and their European supervisors were addressed directly, so that everyone felt inspired to communicate more openly and freely for the safety of all involved. Slides and videos were also shown demonstrating the deep commitment of the oil companies to safety. **The number of deaths and injuries in the high risk work of the oil industry have declined dramatically in the last 30 years thanks to a decision in the industry to make safety a top priority.** Yet the most exciting part of the trip came after the class was", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:060421inspirationaltransformation.txt:0:a2423341a8f6", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 7574, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "060421inspirationaltransformation.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "060421inspirationaltransformation", "chunk_index": 1, "text": "everyone felt inspired to communicate more openly and freely for the safety of all involved.

When David asked what I do when I'm not interpreting, I mentioned that I was involved in transformation work on the Internet. **His eyes immediately lit up as he excitedly told me that in recent years, transformation has become the main focus of his life and even of some of the trainings he leads. ** David and I then engaged in a very exciting, inspiring conversation where, among other things, I told him about all of the amazing connections I've made through my Internet work, and about the deeply committed group of transformation workers who have come together to build a better world. David, in turn, told me about transformational books he's read, highly inspirational workshops he's taken, and a powerful leader in the field of transformation by the name of Lance Secretan ([http://www.secretan.com](http://www.secretan.com)). I had not heard about Secretan, but after a exploring his work on the Internet, I was highly impressed and plan to order a book of his. Most amazing was that Secretan, who has worked closely with some of the top transformation workers on the planet, has set aside time to work with the oil industry on promoting transformative work practices around the world, which is how David got to know him! David works full time training oil industry employees around the globe-both the front line oil rig workers and the staff and executives. **He had a sparkle in his eye as he told me about trainings he's led where by the end of the class, some of these macho oil rig workers for the first time ever would actually hug and express sincere appreciations to each other. **He had no doubt that transformation was gradually spreading throughout the oil industry, and he was thrilled to be a part of it. David and I could have talked all night, but as we had to pack for our respective trips home, we settled for exchanging emails and phone numbers. We are excited to have met each other and feel further inspired to carry forward the powerful work of personal and global transformation. We've already exchanged a few inspiring emails since then.

Transformation is foremost a continuing process that does not have an end point. Transformation is meant to deal with the co-evolution of concepts, processes, organizations and technology. Change in any one of these areas necessitates change in all. Most of the ongoing transformational process is cultural, thus, people are necessary for changing the ways the military operates. Commanders cannot be threatened when subordinates have new ideas, but rather need to encourage new ideas.\" What a thrill to read this on the website of the U.S. Department of Defense!

What's going on is a belief that you can manipulate communicable trust between the leadership and the led. The way you do that is you don't let the press in anywhere. Access to war is extremely limited. The fiercer the combat, the more the access is limited, including access to information. This is a direct contradiction of the stated policy of maximum access to information consistent with national security...There was a time in South Africa when people would put flaming tires around people's necks if they dissented.

He was supported by Vietnam veterans whose war records were impeccable....My sources included outstanding experts like former head of the Defense Intelligence Agency General Tighe and returned POWs like Captain McDaniel, who held the Navy's top award for bravery.

In the months leading up to the November 2000 balloting, Gov. Jeb Bush ordered elections supervisors to purge 58,000 voters on the grounds they were felons not entitled to vote. As it turns out, only a handful of these voters were felons. This extraordinary news ran on page one of the country's leading paper. Unfortunately, it was the wrong country: Britain. In the USA, it was not covered. The office of the governor also illegally ordered the removal of felons from voter rolls-real felons-but with the right to vote under law. As a result, 50,000 of these voters could not vote. The fact that 90% of these were Democrats should have made it news as this alone more than accounted for Bush's victory.

In 1996, I wrote a series of stories that began this way: For the better part of a decade, a Bay Area drug ring sold tons of cocaine to the Crips and Bloods gangs of LA and funneled millions in drug profits to a guerilla army run by the CIA. The cocaine that flooded in helped spark a crack explosion in urban America....The story was developing a momentum all of its own, despite a virtual news blackout from the major media. Ultimately, it was public pressure that forced the national newspapers into the fray. The *Washington Post*, the *New York Times*, and the *Los Angeles Times* published stories, but spent little time exploring the CIA's activities. Instead, my reporting and I became the focus of their scrutiny. It was remarkable *[Mercury News* editor] Ceppos wrote, that the four *Washington Post* reporters assigned to debunk the series \"could not find a single significant factual error.\" A few months later, the *Mercury News* [due to intense CIA pressure] backed away from the story, publishing a long column by Ceppos apologizing for \"shortcomings.\" The *New York Times* hailed Ceppos for \"setting a brave new standard,\" and splashed his apology on their front page, the first time the series had ever been mentioned there. I quit the *Mercury News* not long after that....Do we have a free press today? Sure. It's free to report all the sex scandals, all the stock market news, and every new health fad that comes down the pike.

The largest ten media firms own all US TV networks, most TV stations, all major film studios, all major music companies, nearly all cable TV channels, much of the book and magazine publishing industry, and much, much more. Expensive investigative journalism-especially that which goes after national security or powerful corporate interests-is discouraged.

Louis Pasteur was only a mediocre pupil in undergraduate studies and ranked 15 out of 22 in chemistry. When NFL running back Herschel Walker was in junior high school, he wanted to play football, but the coach told him he was too small. He advised young Herschel to go out for track instead. Never one to give up, he ignored the coach's advice and began an intensive training program to build himself up. Only a few years later, Herschel Walker won the Heisman trophy. When General Douglas MacArthur applied for admission to West Point, he was turned down, not once but twice. But he tried a third time, was accepted and marched into the history books. After Fred Astaire's first screen test, the memo from the testing director of MGM, dated 1933, said, \"Can't act! Slightly bald! Can dance a little!\" Astaire kept that memo over the fireplace in his Beverly Hills home. The father of the sculptor Rodin [[The Thinker Statue](http://www.statue.com/the-thinker-statue.html)] said, \"I have an idiot for a son.\" Described as the worst pupil in the school, Rodin failed three times to secure admittance to the school of art. His uncle called him uneducable. Babe Ruth, considered by sports historians to be the greatest athlete of all time and famous for setting the home run record, also holds the record for strikeouts.

In order for this system to be truly representative, it is vital that the vote of each person participating is counted. **The below *Newsweek* article reveals a clear and present danger to our democratic process with the widespread use of electronic voting machines.** Major security flaws have been reported to exist in these machines [for years now](https://www.WantToKnow.info/electionsproblems), yet the media appears not to have seen this as a high priority. Why isn't this vital news making the top headlines? Besides the important article below, you can see one-paragraph summaries of some of the best major media articles raising serious questions on elections manipulations at [https://www.WantToKnow.info/electronicvoting](https://www.WantToKnow.info/electronicvoting).

Earlier this month a report by Finnish security expert Harri Hursti analyzed Diebold voting machines for an organization called [Black Box Voting](http://www.blackboxvoting.org/). Hursti found unheralded vulnerabilities in the machines that are currently entrusted to faithfully record the votes of millions of Americans. How bad are the problems? **Experts are calling them the most serious voting-machine flaws ever documented.** **Basically the trouble stems from the ease with which the machine's software can be altered.** It requires only a few minutes of pre-election access to a Diebold machine to open the machine and insert a PC card that, if it contained malicious code, could reprogram the machine to give control to the violator. The machine", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:060527electionsvotesmanipulations.txt:0:54913687080c", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 7592, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "060527electionsvotesmanipulations.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "060527electionsvotesmanipulations", "chunk_index": 1, "text": "to faithfully record the votes of millions of Americans. How bad are the problems? **Experts are calling them the most serious voting-machine flaws ever documented.** **Basically the trouble stems from the ease with which the machine's software can be altered.** It requires only a few minutes of pre-election access to a Diebold machine to open the machine and insert a PC card that, if it contained malicious code, could reprogram the machine to give control to the violator. The machine could go dead on Election Day or throw votes to the wrong candidate. Worse, it's even possible for such ballot-tampering software to trick authorized technicians into thinking that everything is working fine, an illusion you couldn't pull off with pre-electronic systems. \"If Diebold had set out to build a system as insecure as they possibly could, this would be it,\" says Avi Rubin, a Johns Hopkins University computer-science professor and elections-security expert. Diebold Election Systems spokesperson David Bear says Hursti's findings do not represent a fatal vulnerability in Diebold technology, but simply note the presence of a feature that allows access to authorized technicians to periodically update the software.** If it so happens that someone not supposed to use the machine-or an election official who wants to put his or her thumb on the scale of democracy-takes advantage of this fast track to fraud, that's not Diebold's problem.** \"[Our critics are] throwing out a 'what if' that's premised on a basis of an evil, nefarious person breaking the law,\" says Bear. Those familiar with the actual election process-by and large run by honest people but historically subject to partisan politicking, dirty tricks and sloppy practices-are less sanguine. \"It gives me a bit of alarm that the voting systems are subject to tampering and errors,\" says Democratic Rep. William Lacy Clay, who worries that machines in his own St. Louis district might be affected by this vulnerability. (In Maryland and Georgia, all the machines are Diebold's.) The Diebold security gap is only the most vivid example of the reality that no electronic voting system can be 100 percent safe or reliable. That's the reason behind an initiative to augment these systems, adding a paper receipt that voters can check to make sure it conforms with their choices. The receipt is retained at the polling place so a physical count can be conducted. **\"When you're using a paperless voting system, there is no security,\" says David Dill, a Stanford professor who founded the election-reform organization [Verified Voting](http://www.verifiedvoting.org/).** To their credit, 26 states have taken action to implement paper trails. But the U.S. Congress has yet to pass legislation introduced last year by Rep. Rush Holt, Democrat of New Jersey, that would extend this protection nationwide. Holt says his bill is slowly gaining support. \"The voters are saying that every vote should count, and the only way to do this is by verified", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:060527electionsvotesmanipulations.txt:1:46b8997adf2c", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 7593, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "060527electionsvotesmanipulations.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "060527electionsvotesmanipulations", "chunk_index": 2, "text": "no security,\" says David Dill, a Stanford professor who founded the election-reform organization [Verified Voting](http://www.verifiedvoting.org/).** To their credit, 26 states have taken action to implement paper trails.

But even an optimistic scenario for passage would challenge his goal of mandatory paper receipts for November's elections. In other words, **it's unlikely that every voter using an electronic voting device in 2006 will know for sure that his or her vote will be reflected in the actual totals. Six years after the 2000 electoral debacle, how can this be?** **Finding Balance: WantToKnow.info Inspiration Center** WantToKnow.info believes it is important to balance disturbing cover-up information with inspirational writings which call us to be all that we can be and to work together for positive change.

In Salon Four, there was a presentation under way on the attack in Oklahoma City, while in the room next door, the splintered factions of the movement were asked - for sake of unity - to seek a common goal. In the foyer, there were stick-pins for sale (\"More gin, less Rummy\"), and in the lecture halls discussions of the melting point of steel. \"It's all documented,\" people said. Or: \"The mass media is [mass deception](https://www.WantToKnow.info/mediacorruption).\" Or, as strangers from the Internet shook hands: \"Great to meet you. Love the work.\" **Such was the coming-out for the movement known as \"9/11 Truth,\" a society of skeptics and scientists who believe the government was complicit in the terrorist attacks. In colleges and chat rooms on the Internet, this band of disbelievers has been trying for years to prove that 9/11 was an inside job.** Whatever one thinks of the claim that the state would plan, then execute, a scheme to murder thousands of its own, there was something to the fact that **more than 500 people - from Italy to Northern California - gathered for the weekend at a major chain hotel near the runways of O'Hare International**.

It was, in tone, half trade show, half political convention. There were talks on the Reichstag fire and the sinking of the Battleship Maine as precedents for 9/11. There were speeches by the lawyer for [James Earl Ray](http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F10D1FFB3D590C758DDDA90994DA404482), who claimed that a military conspiracy killed the Rev. Dr. [Martin Luther King](https://www.WantToKnow.info/060416newsarticles#2), and by a former operative for the British secret service, MI5. \"We feel at this point we've done a lot of solid research, but the American public still is not informed,\" said Michael Berger, press director for [911Truth.org](http://911Truth.org), which sponsored the event. \"We had to come up with a disciplined approach to get it out.\" Mr. Berger, 40, is typical of **9/11 Truthers - a group that, in its rank and file, includes [professors](http://www.st911.org/), chain-saw operators, mothers, engineers, activists, used-book sellers, pizza deliverymen, college students, a former fringe candidate for United States Senate** and a long-haired fellow named hummux (pronounced who-mook) who, on and off, lived in a cave for 15 years. The former owner of a recycling plant outside St. Louis, Mr. Berger joined the movement when he grew skeptical of why the 9/11 Commission had failed, to his sense of sufficiency, to answer how the building at [7 World Trade Center collapsed](http://www.whatreallyhappened.com/wtc7.html) like a ton of bricks. It was his \"9/11 trigger,\" the incident that drew him in, he said. For others, it might be the fact that the [air-defense network](https://www.WantToKnow.info/911/9-11-facts#scrambled) did not prevent the attacks that day, or the appearance of thousands of \"puts\" - or [short-sell bids](https://www.WantToKnow.info/9-11timeline60pg#options) - on the nation's airline stocks. (The 9/11 Commission found the sales innocuous.) Such \"red flags,\" as they are sometimes called, were the meat and potatoes of the keynote speech on Friday night by Alex Jones, who is the William Jennings Bryan of the 9/11 band. Mr. Jones, a syndicated radio host, is known for his larynx-tearing screeds against corruption - fiery, almost preacherly, addresses in which he sweats, balls his fists and often swerves from quoting Roman history to using foul language in a single breath. At the lectern Friday night, beside a digital projection reading \"History of Government Sponsored Terrorism,\" Mr. Jones set forth the central tenets of 9/11 Truth: that the military command that monitors aircraft \"stood down\" on the day of the attacks; that President Bush addressed children in a Florida classroom instead of being whisked off to the White House; that **the hijackers, despite what the authorities say, were", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:060610newyorktimes9-11truth.txt:1:44f38ad30b0c", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 7598, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "060610newyorktimes9-11truth.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "060610newyorktimes9-11truth", "chunk_index": 2, "text": "swerves from quoting Roman history to using foul language in a single breath.

According to the group's Web site, the motive for faking a terrorist attack was to allow the administration \"to instantly implement policies its members have long supported, but which were otherwise infeasible.\" The controlled-demolition theory is the sine qua non of the 9/11 movement - its basic claim and, in some sense, the one upon which all others rest. It is, of course, directly contradicted by the 10,000-page investigation by the National Institute of Standards and Technology, which held that jet-fuel fires distressed the towers' structure, which eventually collapsed. The movement's answer to that report was written by **Steven E. Jones, a professor of physics at Brigham Young University and the movement's expert in the matter of collapse. Dr. Jones, unlike Alex Jones, is a soft-spoken man who lets his writing do the talking. He composed an account of the destruction of the towers ([www.physics.byu.edu/research/energy/htm7.html](http://www.physics.byu.edu/research/energy/htm7.html)) that holds that \"pre-positioned cutter-charges\" brought the buildings down.** Like a prior generation of skeptics - those who doubted, say, the Warren Commission or the government's account of the Gulf of Tonkin attack - the 9/11 Truthers are dogged, at home and in the office, by friends and family who suspect that they may, in fact, be completely nuts. \"Elvis and Area 51 - we're sort of lumped together,\" said Harlan Dietrich, a recent college graduate from Austin, Tex. \"It's attack the messenger, not the message every time.\" To get the message out, the movement has gone beyond bumper stickers and \"Kumbaya\" into political action. **There is a plan, Mr. Berger said, to create a fund to support candidates on a 9/11 platform. There is a plan to create a network of college campus groups. There is a plan by the British delegation (such as it is, so far) to get members of Parliament to watch \"[Loose Change](https://www.WantToKnow.info/060407bestdocumentary9-11),\" the seminal movement DVD.** **It would even seem the Truthers are not alone in believing the whole truth has not come out.

They marched up Kinzle Street to the local affiliate of NBC where, at the plate glass windows, they chanted, \"Talking heads tell lies,\" as the news was being read. \"I hope you don't end up dead somewhere,\" a companion said to a participant, hours earlier as he dropped him at the Loop. \"Don't worry,\" the participant said. \"There's too many of us for that.\" ** Note:** The incredible 9/11 truth video \"[Loose Change](https://www.WantToKnow.info/060407bestdocumentary9-11)\" may be removed from Google due to legal challenges.

Our deepest fear is that we are powerful beyond measure. It is our light, not our darkness That most frightens us. We ask ourselves Who am I to be brilliant, gorgeous, talented, fabulous? Actually, who are you *not* to be? You are a child of God. Your playing small Does not serve the world. There's nothing enlightened about shrinking So that other people won't feel insecure around you. We are all meant to shine, As children do. We were born to make manifest The glory of God that is within us. It's not just in some of us; It's in everyone. And as we let our own light shine, We unconsciously give other people permission to do the same. As we're liberated from our own fear, Our presence automatically liberates others. ** Note:** This inspiring quote on our deepest fear is taken from Marianne Williamson's inspiring book *[A Return to Love](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0060927488/qid=1102218524/sr=2-1/ref=pd_ka_b_2_1/102-2931196-4693767?tag=wanttinfo-20)*.

I want to know if you will risk looking like a fool For love, for your dream, For the adventure of being alive. It doesn't interest me what planets are squaring your moon. I want to know if you have touched the center of your own sorrow, If you have been opened by life's betrayals, Or have become shriveled and closed from fear of further pain. I want to know if you can sit with pain, Mine or your own, Without moving To hide it or fade it or fix it.

The excessive secrecy around the investigations of both 9/11 and the London bombings raise serious questions. Why are our governments using \"national security\" to keep so many crucial documents and videos secret? Why did Tony Blair reject calls for a probe of the London bombings (see [*Financial Times*article](http://news.ft.com/cms/s/8186face-f17a-11d9-9c3e-00000e2511c8.html))?

Some people even claim this picture of the four bombers was faked.** Mark Honigsbaum, who accidentally triggered at least one of the conspiracy theories, investigates. On July 10 last year, Bridget Dunne opened the Sunday newspapers eager for information about the blasts that had brought death and mayhem to London three days earlier. Like many people that weekend, Dunne was confused by the conflicting reports surrounding what had initially been described as a series of \"power surges\" on the tube. **Why were the Metropolitan Police saying that these surges, which were now being attributed to bombs, had occurred simultaneously at 8.50am, when they had originally been described as taking place over the space of 26 minutes?** Dunne, a 51-year-old foster carer, was also having trouble squaring** the Met's statement on July 8 that there", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:060707londonbombings.txt:0:7d1d37f14929", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 7605, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "060707londonbombings.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "060707londonbombings", "chunk_index": 1, "text": "many people that weekend, Dunne was confused by the conflicting reports surrounding what had initially been described as a series of \"power surges\" on the tube. **Why were the Metropolitan Police saying that these surges, which were now being attributed to bombs, had occurred simultaneously at 8.50am, when they had originally been described as taking place over the space of 26 minutes?** Dunne, a 51-year-old foster carer, was also having trouble squaring** the Met's statement on July 8 that there was \"no evidence to suggest that the attacks were the result of suicide bombings\"** with the growing speculation that Islamic suicide bombers and al-Qaida were to blame for the blasts that had hit the London underground and a bus in Tavistock Square. The Met Commissioner, Sir Ian Blair, had talked himself of \"these people who oppose our way of life\". \"I'm not a conspiracy theorist,\" insists Dunne. \"I was just trying to make a cohesive, coherent story from the facts.\" But while the papers that Sunday were full of interviews with people who had survived the bombs, and there was plenty of speculation about Osama bin Laden's involvement, Dunne could find nothing about the times of the tube trains in and out of King's Cross on the morning of July 7. When, a few days later, police released the now famous CCTV image of Shehzad Tanweer, Mohammad Sidique Khan, Jermaine Lindsay and Hasib Hussain entering Luton station, her suspicions deepened. How had police identified the bombers so quickly? And **how was it that amid the carnage of twisted metal and bloody body parts they had been able to recover credit cards and other ID placing the men at the scene of the crime? ** Suspecting something was not right, Dunne, who lives in Camden, north London, wrote to her local paper. \"Do you think we are being told the truth over these bombings?\" she asked. \"There are so many unanswered questions that just don't make any sense.\" Dunne's letter was immediately picked up by a blogger called Blaugustine and within days she found herself the recipient, via the internet, of other intriguing snippets, such as the claim that **on the morning of 7/7 a former Scotland Yard anti-terrorism branch official had been staging a [training exercise](https://www.WantToKnow.info/050713londonbombingcoverup) based on bombs going off simultaneously at precisely the stations that had been targeted**. Convinced more than ever that something was not right, Dunne decided to share her thoughts with her new friends on the internet. **\"I have only one reason for starting [this blog](http://bridgetdunnes.blogspot.com/),\" she wrote last August. \"It is to ascertain the facts behind the events in London on and since the July 7 2005 ... That the times of trains were totally absent from the public domain was one of the factors which led to my suspicions that what we were being told happened was not what actually happened.\" ** It", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:060707londonbombings.txt:1:f431d43f8dbd", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 7606, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "060707londonbombings.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "060707londonbombings", "chunk_index": 2, "text": "decided to share her thoughts with her new friends on the internet. **\"I have only one reason for starting [this blog](http://bridgetdunnes.blogspot.com/),\" she wrote last August. \"It is to ascertain the facts behind the events in London on and since the July 7 2005 ... That the times of trains were totally absent from the public domain was one of the factors which led to my suspicions that what we were being told happened was not what actually happened.\" ** It was a few days after the blasts that I first became aware of the disconnect between what most people believe and accept happened on 7/7 - that four British-born Muslim men decided, of their own volition and for reasons that we may never fully understand, to detonate a series of suicide bombs on the London underground - and what people like Dunne suspect happened. Like many Londoners, I never reached my office on the morning of July 7 but arrived at the tube at 9.30am to find it already closed. Dispatched by the Guardian's newsdesk directly to Edgware Road, I arrived just as passengers from the bombed westbound Circle line train were emerging from the temporary triage centre that had been set up in Marks & Spencer by a former firefighter, Paul Dadge. As with other major London crime scenes - the Israeli embassy bombing in Kensington, the Paddington rail crash, the Brixton nail bombing - the situation was one of confusion and flux. The police had only just begun to cordon off the station, while the fire brigade was attributing the incident to a power surge, even though it was already obvious to all but the greenest commuter that three simultaneous incidents on the tube made little sense even by London underground's woeful performance standards. **I asked passengers what they had seen and experienced and was told by two survivors from the bombed train that, at the moment of the blast, the covers on the floor of their carriage had flown up - the phrase they used was \"raised up\".** There was no time to check their statements as moments later the police widened the cordon and I was directed to the opposite pavement, outside the Metropole hotel. Moments later, Davinia Turrell, the famous \"woman in the mask\", emerged from M&S together with other injured passengers and I followed them into the hotel. It was from there that at around 11am I phoned a hurried, and what I now know to be flawed, audio report to the Guardian. In the report, broadcast on our website, I said that it \"was believed\" there had been an explosion \"under the carriage of the train\". I also said that \"some passengers described how the tiles, the covers on the floors of the train, flew up, raised up\". **It later became clear from interviewing other passengers who had been closer to the seat", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:060707londonbombings.txt:2:cac10f51580a", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 7607, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "060707londonbombings.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "060707londonbombings", "chunk_index": 3, "text": "around 11am I phoned a hurried, and what I now know to be flawed, audio report to the Guardian.

The bombs on the underground were not in the tube carriages. They were under the floors of the carriages.\" Soon, internet chatrooms and blog sites were buzzing with even more bizarre theories: the bombers thought they were delivering drugs but were deceived, set up and murdered; or they thought they were carrying dummy \"bombs\" designed to test London's defences; or the plot was monitored by any number of secret services, from M15 to the CIA to Mossad, who let it happen in order to foment anti-Muslim feeling. Then there are the claims by 9/11 conspiracy theorists that 7/7, like the attacks on the World Trade Centre and the Pentagon, were all part of a cunning scheme to further the pro-Iraq war agenda of the Bush/Blair governments and the \"New World Order\". In the past week we have had two more claims. The first came in a book by US journalist Ron Suskind, alleging that Khan was considered so dangerous by the FBI that in 2003 the US placed him on a \"no fly list\" - a claim that was promptly rubbished by the FBI as a case of mistaken identity. Then, on Saturday, this paper reported that a computer technician who helped to encrypt emails at an Islamic bookshop in Leeds where Khan and Tanweer used to hang out became so alarmed by their calls for jihad that in October 2003 he delivered a dossier to West Yorkshire anti-terrorist police. Martin Gilbertson's claims have not been denied. West Yorkshire police simply admitted it couldn't say whether or not his dossier had \"made its way into the intelligence system\". **Given such confusion, the proliferation of 7/7 conspiracy theories is hardly surprising.

Ever since the Kennedy assassination, people's faith in the official narratives surrounding seismic political events has been steadily eroding.** In their place have come what Don DeLillo, in Libra, his brilliant psychological novel about Kennedy's assassin Lee Harvey Oswald, calls \"theories that gleam like jade idols\". Such theories are seductive precisely because, as DeLillo puts it, they are \"four-faced, graceful\". Employing a 20/20 hindsight whose starting point is always cui bono - who benefits? - they masquerade as an interrogation of the facts but are actually a labyrinth of mirrors. But whereas in 1988, when Libra was published, it took years for conspiracy theories to come together through the sluggish medium of print and telephone, today such networks can be created instantaneously with a few clicks of a mouse. At first sight, Dunne appears as far removed from this paranoid ether-world as you could imagine. Ushering me into her flat, she says she would dearly love to \"turn the clock back to before July 7, before I had all these questions\" and, for a moment, I believe her. \"Before my letter was published in the Camden New Journal, I had little idea of how the internet or blogs worked,\" she tells me. \"I was surprised to discover how many people shared my concerns.\" Today, however, Dunne appears extremely internet savvy. She has invited a colleague to our meeting - a blogger with long dark hair who gives his name only as the Antagonist. From Dunne's blog you can link directly to the Antagonist and other bookmarked sites including that of the July 7 Truth Campaign. At first glance this appears to be an objective guide to everything that happened on 7/7 and afterwards. But click a little deeper and it soon becomes apparent that the campaign, with its linked people's inquiry forum and petition calling for the release of \"all the evidence\" about 7/7, considers the official Home Office account, in which the blame is laid squarely on the four suicide bombers pictured entering Luton station, to be just a \"story\". **The first \"hole\" in the narrative is the Home Office's claim that on July 7 the quartet boarded a 7.40am Thameslink train to King's Cross. According to Dunne, when an independent researcher visited Luton and demanded a train schedule from Thameslink, he was told that the 7.40am had never run and that the next available train, the 7.48, had arrived at King's Cross at 8.42 - in other words", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:060707londonbombings.txt:4:9aea781468ef", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 7609, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "060707londonbombings.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "060707londonbombings", "chunk_index": 5, "text": "suicide bombers pictured entering Luton station, to be just a \"story\". **The first \"hole\" in the narrative is the Home Office's claim that on July 7 the quartet boarded a 7.40am Thameslink train to King's Cross. According to Dunne, when an independent researcher visited Luton and demanded a train schedule from Thameslink, he was told that the 7.40am had never run and that the next available train, the 7.48, had arrived at King's Cross at 8.42 - in other words too late for the bombers to have boarded the three tube trains that exploded, according to the official timings, eight minutes later at Aldgate, Edgware Road and Russell Square. ** **The next problem is the [CCTV picture](http://www.guardian.co.uk/attackonlondon/story/0,,1806794,00.html). If you look closely at the image, Dunne says, you will see that the railings behind Khan, the man in the white baseball cap, appear to run in front of his left arm while another rail appears to slice through his head.** \"It's just a theory but some people believe the image was faked in Photoshop,\" she tells me. **To Dunne's way of thinking, this theory is bolstered by the fact that police have never released the further CCTV footage showing the four emerging on to the concourse at King's Cross where, according to the home office narrative, they are seen hugging and appear \"euphoric\".** Then there is the \"fact\" that in the only other CCTV sequence of the bombers taken on June 28 (the day police believe they made a test run to London), only three men - Khan, Tanweer and Lindsay - are seen entering Luton station. Hasib Hussain, who would detonate a rucksack bomb on the top deck of the No 30 bus, providing the only above-ground image of what Sir Ian Blair would later call \"the largest criminal inquiry in English history\", is nowhere to be seen. \"I know people who have spoken to Hasib Hussain's family,\" says Dunne. \"He was in the middle of his college career. He was taking driving lessons. I don't have a conspiracy theory, but until I've seen all the evidence and can personally join the dots I can't say that he or any of these men were suicide bombers.\" Dunne and the Antagonist aren't the only ones who would like to see all the evidence. Rachel North, who was travelling in the front carriage of the Piccadilly line train with Lindsay when he detonated his bomb deep beneath Russell Square, and who miraculously escaped with only minor injuries, has also called for an independent public inquiry. But unlike Dunne she does not think there is any mystery about what happened. \"We all know what happened,\" she says. \"We were there. What we want to know is why it happened.\" She says that conspiracy theorists have repeatedly twisted her words to make out there was no bomb on her train and even that she", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:060707londonbombings.txt:5:3bc8ea9f7466", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 7610, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "060707londonbombings.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "060707londonbombings", "chunk_index": 6, "text": "detonated his bomb deep beneath Russell Square, and who miraculously escaped with only minor injuries, has also called for an independent public inquiry.

What we want to know is why it happened.\" She says that conspiracy theorists have repeatedly twisted her words to make out there was no bomb on her train and even that she is a professional M15 disinformation agent. When she challenged these claims, she says she was subjected to vitriolic abuse. As a consequence, she refuses to have anything to do with the July 7 Truth Campaign or related sites, arguing that they risk undermining the legitimacy of survivors' calls for a public inquiry. \"I have had endless run-ins with these people,\" she says. \"Some of them are fairly well intentioned, if eccentric, others hugely offensive. I worry that they are making all of us look like conspiracy theorists and/or traumatised people who shouldn't be taken seriously.\" She argues that given that inquests have yet to be held, and the ongoing mass-murder inquiry, it is hardly surprising that the police have withheld evidence from the public domain. Quite apart from the distress that the release of CCTV images might cause relatives, North says she has been told there are people in the background of the King's Cross CCTV sequence whom police are still trying to trace. Police have also kept back details of what the bombers were wearing in order to be sure that witness statements taken from people who may have seen them on the Thameslink train can be corroborated. \"Train timetables rarely bear any relation to real life,\" says North dismissively. \"Where conspiracy theorists go with this is that the train never ran, so the bombers were never on the train, or the bombers were lured to Luton and then taken away and killed and their body parts were placed on the tube later to incriminate Muslims. They just take these small anomalies, which is what you will get in any rolling, multi-sourced news investigation, and make it into evidence of a conspiracy.\" North isn't the only person with first-hand experience of 7/7 whose testimony has been called into question. Paul Dadge, the \"hero of Edgware Road\" (it was his idea to set up the temporary triage centre in M&S), who was photographed leading Davinia Turrell from M&S to the Metropole hotel, has also been on the receiving end. On internet bulletin boards people have questioned why he is wearing blue surgical gloves in the picture (reproduced on the cover of G2) and wonder why Turrell, who is now 25, appears \"so old\" and where she got the mask from. \"Basically, people were saying the picture was made up by the government to forward the campaign against terrorism in Iraq,\"", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:060707londonbombings.txt:6:6fd08b04f944", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 7611, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "060707londonbombings.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "060707londonbombings", "chunk_index": 7, "text": "who was photographed leading Davinia Turrell from M&S to the Metropole hotel, has also been on the receiving end.

Dadge never reached work on 7/7 but was forced to interrupt his journey at Baker Street. Travelling on a westbound Hammersmith & City line train just behind the bombed Circle line train, he left the station at 8.53am and began walking towards Paddington when he noticed the fire engines heading towards Edgware Road and decided to investigate. To this day, his abiding memory, like my own, is one of confusion and chaos. In his testimony to the London Assembly, Dadge told the inquiry team looking into the failings of the emergency response that he felt he had no choice but to take command of the situation as the police were clearly overstretched and it was \"becoming difficult to establish who was passing public, and who was involved in the incident\". For the record, Dadge who works for the internet provider AOL and whose job there, ironically, involves monitoring discussion threads, says he was not part of any \"black ops\" but obtained the gloves from a paramedic in M&S. The same paramedics provided Turrell with the mask to protect her burns. Yet although Dadge, like North, has been a target for vitriol - some objected to his being described as a hero - he doesn't seem to mind. \"I don't read the conspiracy theories and get upset,\" he says. \"I read them and I'm intrigued.\" Indeed, it is natural after an event as cataclysmic and unexpected as 7/7 to want to interrogate what happened. But interrogation is not the same as understanding, and after a certain point you must move on. **As I leave Dunne's flat, she tells me that she and [the Antagonist](http://antagonise.blogspot.com) are in the process of refining the [July 7 Truth Campaign site](http://www.julyseventh.co.uk/) and are still uncovering new \"facts\". \"I can't explain it but something shifted for me that day,\" she says. ** When I get home, I decide to take a look. Under the heading Some Hypotheses is a list of alternative theories. Number one is \"al-Qaida mastermind recruited British Muslims as suicide bombers\".

But it is the next entry that I find most alarming.

Then I press the button and loop the broadcast a second time.

Though by no means do I think you should follow my path, I invite you to read this short essay and see if there might be some gems to help you move more fully into your infinite potential.

Every one of us makes hundreds of choices every day. Every choice we make has an impact on our lives. Even insignificant choices can affect what we experience and how we feel. When hunger strikes, we can reach for a healthy, nutritious snack, or we can choose the sugar high of junk food. The more important the decision, the more profound its effect. For instance, do I choose to be passive, or do I [set clear intentions](https://www.weboflove.org/lifepurposeintentions) and create what I want in my life? And how do I act towards that person who treated me badly? Every choice we make, however big or small, affects us in some way. **How Do You Make Choices?** If you are interested in living a richer, fuller life, there is a foundation upon which you can base all of your decisions which can make life better not only for you, but also for all around you. This foundation is to choose based on what's best for all of us. Imagine a world where every parent, spouse, friend, teacher, businessperson, and politician truly did their best to choose what's best for all involved in every decision they made. We would certainly live in a much more caring, supportive world. **It's the Intention**. \"But how do I know what is really best?\" you might ask. The answer is simple. It doesn't matter. What matters is not the choice you make, but rather the intention behind your choice. What matters is that whatever decision you make, you are clear in your intention of choosing based on what's best for all. If it later turns out that you made what appears to have been a bad choice, there's no need for guilt. Knowing that you did your best to choose with a sincere desire for what's best for all, your conscience", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:060715keystolife.txt:0:636119657aa7", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 7614, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "060715keystolife.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "060715keystolife", "chunk_index": 1, "text": "It doesn't matter. What matters is not the choice you make, but rather the intention behind your choice. What matters is that whatever decision you make, you are clear in your intention of choosing based on what's best for all. If it later turns out that you made what appears to have been a bad choice, there's no need for guilt. Knowing that you did your best to choose with a sincere desire for what's best for all, your conscience stays clear and open. This then allows you to more easily learn from your mistakes, and to live with a clear heart and mind. **What's Best for Me, Too!** Choosing what's best does not mean you have to always sacrifice yourself for others. An overly exhausted mother can lose her temper easily. Some time off for this mother might seem selfish, yet in the long run, it can help her to be a better mother to her children. So let us remember as we move through each day of our lives to do our best to choose what's best for all of us. ** Divine Guidance** **Many Meanings for Divine.** Guidance can come from many sources. Yet by opening to guidance from the divine, we open to the support of powerful forces greater than ourselves. The divine clearly has different meanings for different people, whether it be God, Creator, Jehovah, Allah, or Great Spirit. Yet even if you don't believe in these, consider the possibility that there is a very wise part of yourself-a higher self or a deeper self-which can provide you with guidance. What is important is that we open to this presence, however we choose to define the divine, and that we consciously invite this powerful guidance into our daily lives. **All Requests Only if it's Best. **When seeking divine guidance with a specific result, be sure to end with \"only if this is what's best for all.\" There are times when what's best is not what's easiest or most enjoyable. Sometimes unwanted or unexpected challenges, difficult situations, and even pain can teach us important lessons that in the long run help us to enjoy life more fully. When we choose to see all experiences as gifts from the divine and opportunities for growth and understanding, we open to a deeper level of divine guidance. ** Acceptance and Understanding** **Our Core Essence. **Deep down we are all beautiful beings [worthy of love and support](https://www.momentoflove.org). The sweet innocence of babies and young children is a clear example of this. Yet for most of us, the shining essence with which we came into this life became obscured over the years as our family and others were unable to give us the kind of unconditional love and support we so craved.

The sweet innocence of babies and young children is a clear example of this. Yet for most of us, the shining essence with which we came into this life became obscured over the years as our family and others were unable to give us the kind of unconditional love and support we so craved. As children, when we were repeatedly told that we were not good enough or were punished just for being who we are, thick layers of confusion and doubt developed, clouding our divine essence. Layers of fear and insecurity were woven into our personalities. **The Mask. **By the time we are grown, most of us have developed a protective mask or persona to hide these layers of fear and insecurity from others, and at times even from ourselves. Outwardly we might appear happy or content, yet on the inside most of us to varying degrees feel unhappy with who we are. Yet beneath it all, that [shining essence](https://www.weboflove.org/050614shortinspiringpoems) is still there. No matter how much we may have forgotten, no matter how thick those overshadowing layers may be, our beautiful core essence is and has always been there. **Accepting and Understanding Myself. ** By choosing to accept and understand all of who you are-both your deep shining essence and the layers of dark clouds within-you can invite that beautiful inner essence to shine through the clouds and to shine again in your life. When fears, dark thoughts, or difficult emotions arise, first choose to accept that they that they are there. Then work towards understanding these dark clouds and where they came from. Ask for divine guidance as you explore and [transform these dark places](https://www.WantToKnow.info/coreissue). **Courage. **It takes courage to accept and work to understand our fears and weaknesses. Yet by doing our best to be fully ourselves in all our strengths and weaknesses, our relationships can grow richer, deeper, and more meaningful. This may be challenging, as some people are unable or unwilling to accept certain parts of us. Yet as those around us see us becoming more real and honest with them, they may also be inspired to be more real and honest with us. Thus, instead of continually avoiding or denying those clouds or dark layers in both ourselves and others, we open to a deeper, more authentic way of living and of relating to others. **Accepting and Understanding Others. **As you develop greater acceptance and understanding of yourself, you will notice that others, too, have lost touch with their shining core essence. As you work to accept and understand yourself, it is most important that you choose also to [give this gift](https://www.weboflove.org/transformation#seeing) to those around you.

Acceptance of what is, coupled with understanding of what we can change and what we cannot, allows us to find the courage to be all that we can be, and to empower others in doing the same. ** Love and Empowerment** **Let me start with myself.** I will do my best to love and empower myself to be the best I can be every day of my life. By making this commitment to yourself, it becomes easier to love and empower those around you. But do you really want to give this gift to all other people? What if you really don't like someone? In this case, you can remind yourself that it is usually a person's personality that you don't like-the mask or dark clouds blocking their deeper essence. Remember that beneath the mask is a shining divine essence. While acknowledging those parts you don't like, do your best to empower the shining being hidden beneath the mask or personality that you don't like. You can choose to love and empower the divine spark within all. **Negative Judgment.** Judging someone to be bad as a person does not empower or inspire anyone to be a better person. When you find yourself feeling negative judgment, first acknowledge the part of you that wants to judge-the part that wants to be right and better than others. Then do your best to learn from your judgment and let it go. Open to finding first acceptance, and then understanding and love both for your own divine essence and for that of the person you judged. Choose to let your last thought always be that of love. **Stopping harm.** What if someone does something that is clearly wrong, or is causing harm? In this case, be firm and take whatever action you feel is best to stop harm. Enforcing a serious consequence with someone who has acted grossly out of self-interest may be the most loving, empowering action you can take. Yet even as you take action, open to seeing the inner turmoil that causes people to do harm. You can act from a place of love and support, even while firmly stopping someone from doing wrong or causing harm. Through choosing to see beneath all of the pain, suffering, and hatred, and to recognize and [connect with the divine essence](https://www.weboflove.org/wingmakers#seeing) within even those who would do us harm, not only do we heal the world, we heal ourselves. **Imagine...** Imagine for a moment a world where all people truly did their best to love and empower each other.

In reality, events usually have much less exciting explanations.\" One of the first American officials to publicly acknowledge conspiracy theories in connection with 9/11 was President George Bush, who on November 10, 2001, in a speech to the General Assembly of the United Nations, said, \"Let us never tolerate outrageous conspiracy theories concerning the attacks of September 11.\" **Yet according to a [May 2006 Zogby poll](https://www.WantToKnow.info/060523newsarticles#1), 42", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:060723a9-11conspiracy.txt:0:1f0e43d8216a", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 7619, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "060723a9-11conspiracy.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "060723a9-11conspiracy", "chunk_index": 1, "text": "rarely true, even though they have great appeal and are often widely believed.

Since it appeared on the Web in April 2005, the 80-minute film has been climbing up and down Google Video's \"Top 100,\" rising to No. 1 this May, with at least 10 million viewings.** \"We beat the woman getting punched in the face,\" says its director, 22-year-old Dylan Avery, from Oneonta, New York (population 13,000), referring to an oft watched video. \"We beat the guy who beats his computer with his keyboard,\" says his producer, 23-year-old Korey Rowe, also from Oneonta and an army specialist who served in Afghanistan and Iraq. \"We beat the [Stephen] Colbert speech,\" says Jason Bermas, 26, their researcher. \"The viral videos, we dominate them.\" Told in MTV-style jump cuts, illustrated by high-end graphics, and scored with hip music written by a few of their friends, *Loose Change* is an investigation into the official story of 9/11 as told by *The 9/11 Commission Report,* asking a number of highly controversial questions: What, for example, were the explosions some witnesses heard after the towers were hit by planes? Why was the site of the collapse not treated as a crime scene, and why was the debris shipped off as waste to several foreign countries? **Why were the black boxes from American Airlines Flight 11 and United Airlines Flight 175 never found, when the passport of one of Flight 11's alleged hijackers, Satam Al Suqami, turned up unscathed a few blocks from the World Trade Center?** How did American Airlines Flight 77, which crashed into the Pentagon, disappear into a 20-foot hole, leaving no trace of its 124-foot wingspan on the building? And what's with all the forewarnings that the government ignored? **For the past three months, 20,000 people a day have been clicking on to the official *Loose Change* Web site, [loosechange911.com](http://www.loosechange911.com); more than 50,000 have placed orders for the DVD since its release.

(\"But we're not really making any money,\" says Rowe, \"because we gave away like 100,000 copies for free.\") Millions more have been downloading the film from a growing number of unaffiliated sites.** It's safe to say that, if it were a theatrical release, *Loose Change* would be one of the most popular-and incendiary-movies in the country right now. Avery and Rowe say they are talking to several major movie studios about releasing a third and \"final cut\" of the film on September 11, 2006. They wonder if the government may be watching, too. \"I hope so,\" says Avery. In the opening credits of *Loose Change,* we hear Mick O'Regan, a host on Australian radio, asking the late Hunter S. Thompson, in a 2002 interview, \"How would you rate the American media in their coverage of the events of the attack last September?\" \"Well let's see, uh, 'shamefully' is a word that comes to mind,\" says the father of gonzo journalism. \"I've spent enough time, well, on the inside of the White House and political campaigns, and I've known enough of the people who do these things, to know that the public version of the news or whatever event is never really what happened.\" **Most of what we see on-screen during *Loose Change* are actually news reports from mainstream-media outlets like CBS News, *Newsweek,* CNN, the Associated Press, even Fox News-the \"loose change\" which Avery adds up into a conspiracy theory.** \"Some people accuse me of like, Oh, you're taking quotes out of context,\" he says. \"I'm giving you the article and the date. Go look it up yourself.\" *Loose Change* runs clips from almost every major TV news organization on that horrible day, wherein we see footage of people escaping the towers, firemen, and reporters who talk of hearing explosions after the planes hit; for some this raises questions of whether there were pre-set bombs going off in the buildings. Here's Bryant Gumbel on CBS: \"We understand there has been a secondary explosion on Tower One ... \" **Freeze-frame images of the towers going down show what some say appear to be demolition \"squibs,\" or horizontal plumes of smoke and debris being ejected during the collapse, also suggesting explosions.** *Loose Change* also delves into the question of why the United States' elaborate air-defense system failed to thwart the September 11 attacks. *The 9/11 Commission Report* says \"there was no one to blame.\" The film points to a 20-page instruction from June 1, 2001, issued by the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff which", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:060723a9-11conspiracy.txt:2:6d33a061870f", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 7621, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "060723a9-11conspiracy.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "060723a9-11conspiracy", "chunk_index": 3, "text": "down show what some say appear to be demolition \"squibs,\" or horizontal plumes of smoke and debris being ejected during the collapse, also suggesting explosions.** *Loose Change* also delves into the question of why the United States' elaborate air-defense system failed to thwart the September 11 attacks. *The 9/11 Commission Report* says \"there was no one to blame.\" The film points to a 20-page instruction from June 1, 2001, issued by the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff which reassigned the authority for aircraft interceptions and shoot-downs to Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld. Titled \"Aircraft Piracy (Hijacking) and Destruction of Derelict Airborne Objects,\" the instruction states that henceforth \"the NMCC [National Military Command Center] will ... forward requests for DOD assistance to the Secretary of Defense for approval.\" Neither the president nor the vice president is mentioned in the new directive as being part of the chain of command. By military protocol, the authority belonged to Rumsfeld, who later claimed he was \"out of the loop.\" 'Are you sort of suggesting that [9/11] worked in the favor of the Bush administration?,\" Mick O'Regan asks Hunter S. Thompson in *Loose Change.* \"Oh, absolutely. Absolutely,\" Thompson says. \"You sort of wonder when something happens like this, well, who stands to benefit? Who had the opportunity and the motive?\" The film's answer to this is the September 2000 report from the Project for the New American Century, a neoconservative think tank whose members include Donald Rumsfeld, Dick Cheney, Jeb Bush, and Paul Wolfowitz. Titled \"Rebuilding America's Defenses,\" it envisions a future of burgeoning defense spending and the overthrow of Saddam Hussein. \"The process of transformation, even if it brings revolutionary change, is likely to be a long one, absent some catastrophic and catalyzing event-like a new Pearl Harbor,\" Avery reads from the report in voice-over. It's a long leap from all this, however, to claiming, \"The government did it.\" There is no conclusive evidence in *Loose Change* of U.S. government involvement in 9/11. The film relies too heavily on already published reports, some of which have been discredited. For example, the segment on United Flight 93 cites an early story from a Cincinnati ABC News affiliate, WCPO, on the plane's safe landing at a Cleveland airport on the morning of September 11. WCPO later retracted the story. For the final cut of *Loose Change,* Avery says, \"We're tracking down potential eyewitnesses to the landing of Flight 93 in Cleveland.\" He also says the third edition of the film will include more on-screen interviews; the first version had only one, with Marcel Bernard, the chief flight instructor at Freeway Airport, in Bowie, Maryland. Bernard recalls that, in early August 2001, **Hani Hanjour, one of the alleged hijackers of American Airlines Flight 77, had trouble controlling and landing a single-engine Cessna 172 when he did test runs. \"Average or below-average piloting skills,\" Bernard says.**", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:060723a9-11conspiracy.txt:3:ba6c6e96c316", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 7622, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "060723a9-11conspiracy.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "060723a9-11conspiracy", "chunk_index": 4, "text": "the landing of Flight 93 in Cleveland.\" He also says the third edition of the film will include more on-screen interviews; the first version had only one, with Marcel Bernard, the chief flight instructor at Freeway Airport, in Bowie, Maryland.

On May 16, the Department of Justice released two Pentagon videotapes of the crash of Flight 77 after a Freedom of Information Act request by Judicial Watch, a conservative government watchdog. \"Finally, we hope that this video will put to rest the conspiracy theories involving American Airlines Flight 77,\" said Judicial Watch president Tom Fitton. The video \"shows the nose cone of the plane clearly entering the picture,\" said Fox News. You can decide for yourself by watching the video at [defenselink.mil/pubs/foi/index.html](http://defenselink.mil/pubs/foi/index.html). The Pentagon crash, the collapse of the World Trade Center, the crash of Flight 93-almost every aspect of what happened on 9/11 but the sheer horror of it-have become the subject of debate the world over. Yet in America, questioners of the government's official story are often depicted as harmless loonies. (In a piece in *The New York Times* in June, the 9/11 Truthers were said to include \"professors, chain-saw operators ... and a long-haired fellow named Hummux ... who, on and off, lived in a cave for 15 years.\") **In 2002, Italy awarded its highest literary prize, the Naples Prize, to *The War on Freedom: How and Why America Was Attacked, September 11, 2001,* a book by British writer Nafeez Mosaddeq Ahmed that claims the U.S. government was complicit in the attacks. *The New Pearl Harbor: Disturbing Questions About the Bush Administration and 9/11,* by David Ray Griffin, a professor at the Claremont School of Theology, in California, has become the leading book on 9/11 conspiracy theories in this country, selling more than 100,000 copies** and popularizing among 9/11 Truth activists the expressions \"MIHOP\" and \"LIHOP\"-for the government \"made it happen on purpose\" or \"let it happen on purpose.\" But go down", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:060723a9-11conspiracy.txt:4:a541f1fd1761", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 7623, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "060723a9-11conspiracy.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "060723a9-11conspiracy", "chunk_index": 5, "text": "that claims the U.S. government was complicit in the attacks. *The New Pearl Harbor: Disturbing Questions About the Bush Administration and 9/11,* by David Ray Griffin, a professor at the Claremont School of Theology, in California, has become the leading book on 9/11 conspiracy theories in this country, selling more than 100,000 copies** and popularizing among 9/11 Truth activists the expressions \"MIHOP\" and \"LIHOP\"-for the government \"made it happen on purpose\" or \"let it happen on purpose.\" But go down the wormhole of 9/11 conspiracies and you will find *Loose Change* detractors even among 9/11 Truthers, one of whom recently called the film a \"very fine piece of CIA disinformation.\" \"That's ridiculous,\" Avery says. \"The idea that three kids from a hick town in upstate New York are part of a C.I.A. disinformation campaign would just show how desperate our government is.\" There's a blog dedicated to debunking his film ([screwloosechange.blogspot.com](http://www.screwloosechange.blogspot.com)), and detractors will point you to a widely read *Popular Mechanics* cover piece from 2005 entitled \"9/11, Debunking the Myth,\" which tackles many of the questions raised in the film. (Conspiracy buffs claim that the article's lead researcher, Benjamin Chertoff, is a cousin of Department of Homeland Security secretary Michael Chertoff. Benjamin Chertoff could not be reached for comment.) Avery and Rowe have also received a letter threatening a lawsuit by Gedeon and Jules Naudet, whose footage from the morning of the attack on the Twin Towers was used without permission in *Loose Change.* Avery's lawyer is arguing that it's permissible under \"fair use.\" (Full disclosure: The editor of this magazine was an executive producer on the Naudet brothers' CBS special, *9/11.*) Certainly, few can accept the claim on the *Loose Change* DVD box that says, \"What you will see inside will prove without a shadow of a doubt that everything you know about 9/11 is a complete fabrication.\" One thing seems sure: *Loose Change* has struck a nerve. \"Love us or hate us, we've done the movement a favor,\" Avery says. \"We've gotten 9/11 truth out there.\" Undoubtedly what has put *Loose Change* ahead of the pack of 9/11 conspiracy fare is that it's a pretty watchable movie-especially considering it cost $2,000 and was made on Avery's Compaq Presario laptop. \"I saved money serving ice cream at Friendly's,\" Avery says. He never attended college himself and was rejected from Purchase Film College twice. *Loose Change: 2nd Edition* (which has additional footage Avery bought on eBay) cost about $6,000 to make, money he saved while working at a Red Lobster and a Starbucks in Silver Springs, Maryland, where he moved in 2004 to \"get out of Oneonta.\" In 2005 he moved back to his hometown. **And now Avery, a *South Park*-watching, video-game-writing, self-described \"nerd,\" has become an Internet folk hero-at least for many young people, for whom 9/11 is the defining news event of their lives. \"This is our", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:060723a9-11conspiracy.txt:5:6017b175ff46", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 7624, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "060723a9-11conspiracy.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "060723a9-11conspiracy", "chunk_index": 6, "text": "has additional footage Avery bought on eBay) cost about $6,000 to make, money he saved while working at a Red Lobster and a Starbucks in Silver Springs, Maryland, where he moved in 2004 to \"get out of Oneonta.\" In 2005 he moved back to his hometown. **And now Avery, a *South Park*-watching, video-game-writing, self-described \"nerd,\" has become an Internet folk hero-at least for many young people, for whom 9/11 is the defining news event of their lives. \"This is our generation's Kennedy assassination,\" says Rowe.** Consider another [Zogby poll from August 2004](https://www.WantToKnow.info/zogby911), which found that 63 percent of New Yorkers under 30 believe some U.S. leaders \"knew in advance that attacks were planned on or around September 11, 2001, and that they consciously failed to act.\" For young people like these, coming of age at a time when 9/11 is being used to justify war, the slashing of civil liberties, domestic spying, and torture, Avery is a new sort of yippie, doing something outrageous in the face of power, making him the subject of boy worship and girl crushes. \"You're an amazing man,\" a young woman named \"Kaella\" recently wrote on his MySpace page, where Avery has over 2,600 \"friends.\" \"More people should see this documentary. I'm spreading the word.\" In February, after watching *Loose Change,* Samantha Woodhouse, 21, quit paramedic school in Corning, New York, to be near Avery. \"She tracked me down,\" Avery says with a shrug. Now she's his girlfriend and his secretary too. \"Awesome work, man,\" wrote \"James,\" another of Avery's MySpace fans. \"I've shown the 2nd edition to everyone I know and it's opening some eyes, even of my parents. Remember, the truth will set us free.\" \"You're my hero,\" wrote \"Ali.\" **After Mike Malloy of Air America talked up the movie on-air last year, Avery, Rowe, and Bermas were off on a tour of college campuses, including Princeton, SUNY Binghamton, and the University of Arizona. \"We went and screwed some people's minds up there,\" Rowe says.** **Lefty radio stations like KPFK, in Los Angeles, and WBAI, in New York, find they get such positive responses when they do a program on the film they're now using it during fund-raising drives. \"Every time we offer [the film as a pledge gift] it generates some excitement throughout the city,\" said WBAI program director Bernard White during a May interview with Avery, Rowe, and Bermas.** 'It's weird,\" Avery told me over Memorial Day weekend. \"It's all been so weird.\" He was standing in the field behind the dilapidated house he shares with Rowe, Bermas, and Woodhouse. They were having a party, which they called Louderfest, for their film company, Louder than Words. There was a barbecue going; a jazz band of local young guys was playing. About 40 kids were milling around, smoking and drinking, some wearing black \"Investigate 9/11\" T-shirts. \"I was supposed to be making", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:060723a9-11conspiracy.txt:6:9fc0b4dffd70", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 7625, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "060723a9-11conspiracy.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "060723a9-11conspiracy", "chunk_index": 7, "text": "Avery told me over Memorial Day weekend. \"It's all been so weird.\" He was standing in the field behind the dilapidated house he shares with Rowe, Bermas, and Woodhouse.

About 40 kids were milling around, smoking and drinking, some wearing black \"Investigate 9/11\" T-shirts. \"I was supposed to be making a fictional story about me and my friends discovering that 9/11 was an inside job, and doing something about it,\" he said, \"and basically that happened in real life.\" When he started writing this film, also called *Loose Change,* he was 18. \"I started researching 9/11 and I found an article on the World Trade Center-someone had posted a picture of a controlled demolition and then a picture of the World Trade Center collapsing. And I was like, Wow, O.K. And then you find one article and that article links to 10 others, and before you know it you're up until six in the morning. It's crazy, the information takes over.\" He started relaying the information to his childhood friend Rowe, who was stationed in Afghanistan with the 101st Airborne Division, 187th Infantry. (\"I didn't believe it at first,\" Rowe later told me. \"I was like, things are wrong, but they're not *that* wrong.\") \"It wasn't supposed to be true,\" Avery said. \"And then I started realizing that, you know, we were lied to. And then it was: Well, do I keep making this a fictional film, or do I focus on the real thing and write about what really happened? And that's where I went with it.\" He said he always knew he wanted to be a director. In 2002 he met *Sopranos* star James Gandolfini at the opening party for Vines, a restaurant in Oneonta that Gandolfini had helped finance. \"He told me if I want to be a successful director I have to say something to the entire world. I have to have a message,\" Avery said. \"I think that's one of the reasons our movie's successful, because it's a movie about something that...matters. Even if you disagree with it you still walk out thinking back to that day and at least questioning something. **\"You have to be a skeptic,\" he said. \"You can't believe anything someone tells you just because they told you to. Especially your government, and especially your media-the two institutions that are put there to control you. And you're going to tell me you're going to take their word for everything? I don't think so.\"** I asked him what he thought was going to happen with the 9/11 issue. He paused for a moment. \"Second American revolution,\" he said. \"I really think there's going to be anger.

Because when it becomes irrefutable public record that 9/11 was done by our government the sh-- is gonna hit the fan. People are going to be upset. You can't stop it. People say, Aw, we need a peaceful revolution. We need to peacefully change things. Trust me, that's a great idea-I'm all for it. But Americans are violent, especially when they've been lied to, especially over something like this. So much has been lost because of 9/11-I mean, families have been shattered. There's so much pain....\" Some of the kids were lighting a bonfire. He went off to watch it. *Nancy Jo Sales is a* Vanity Fair *contributing editor.

With best wishes, Fred Burks for [PEERS](https://www.peerservice.org) and [WantToKnow.info](https://www.WantToKnow.info) [Former language interpreter](https://www.wanttoknow.info/g/fredburks/down_the_rabbit_hole) for Presidents Bush and Clinton **WAR IS A RACKET - by General Smedley Butler ** **War is a racket. It always has been. It is possibly the oldest, easily the most profitable, surely the most vicious. It is the only one in which the profits are reckoned in dollars and the losses in lives.** In the World War [World War I] a mere handful garnered the profits of the conflict. At least 21,000 new millionaires and billionaires were made in the United States during the World War. That many admitted huge gains in their income tax returns. How many other war millionaires falsified their tax returns no one knows. *[Please note these are 1935 U.S. dollars. To adjust for inflation, multiply all figures X 10 or more]* **WHO MAKES THE PROFITS?** The World War cost the United States some $52 billion. That means $400 [*over $4,000 in today's dollars*] to every American man, woman, and child. **The normal yearly profits of a business concern in the U.S. are 6 to 12%. But war-time profits, that is another matter - 60, 100, 300, and even 1,800% - the sky is the limit.** Uncle Sam has the money. Let's get it. Of course, it isn't put that crudely in war time. It is dressed into speeches about patriotism, love of country, and \"we must all put our shoulders to the wheel,\" but the profits jump, leap, and skyrocket - and are safely pocketed.

Take our friends the du Ponts, the powder people. The average pre-war earnings of the du Ponts for the period 1910 to 1914 were $6 million a year. Now let's look at their average yearly profit during the war years, 1914 to 1918. $58 million a year profit we find! Nearly ten times that of normal times, and the profits of normal times were pretty good. An increase in profits of more than 950%. Take one of our steel companies. Their 1910-1914 yearly earnings averaged $6 million. Then came the war. And, like loyal citizens, Bethlehem Steel promptly turned to munitions making. Did their profits jump? Well, their 1914-1918 average was $49 million a year! Or, let's take United States Steel. The normal earnings during the five-year period prior to the war were $105 million a year. Then along came the war and up went the profits. The average yearly profit for the period 1914-1918 was $240 million. Not bad. **They sold your Uncle Sam 20 million mosquito nets for the use of the soldiers overseas. Well, not one of these mosquito nets ever got to France! **There were pretty good profits in mosquito netting, even if there were no mosquitoes in France. When the war was over some 4 million sets of equipment - knapsacks and the things that go to fill them - crammed warehouses on this side. Now they are being scrapped because the regulations have changed the contents. But the manufacturers collected their wartime profits on them. If anyone had the cream of the profits it was the bankers. Being partnerships rather than incorporated organizations, they do not have to report to stockholders. Their profits were as secret as they were immense. **How the bankers made their millions and their billions I do not know, because those little secrets never become public - even before a Senate investigatory body.** It has been estimated that the war cost your Uncle Sam $52 billion [*X 10 or more for inflation*]. Of this sum, $39 billion was expended in the actual war itself. This expenditure yielded $16 billion in profits. That is how the 21,000 billionaires and millionaires got that way. This $16 billion profits is not to be sneezed at. It is quite a tidy sum. And it went to a very few. **WHO PAYS THE BILLS?** Who provides these nice little profits of 20, 100, 300, 1,500 and 1,800 per cent? We all pay them - in taxation.

Or visit any of the veteran's hospitals in the United States. On a tour of the country, I visited 18 government hospitals for veterans. In them are a total of about 50,000 destroyed men - men who were the pick of the nation 18 years ago. Mortality among veterans is three times as great as those who stayed at home. Boys with a normal viewpoint were taken out of the offices, factories, and classrooms and put into the ranks. There they were remolded. **They were made to \"about face,\" to regard murder as the order of the day.** They were put through mass psychology and entirely changed. We trained them to think nothing at all of killing or of being killed. Then, suddenly, we discharged them and told them to make another \"about face!\" This time they had to do their own readjustment. We didn't need them any more. Many of these fine young boys are eventually destroyed, mentally, because they could not make that final \"about face\" alone. Beautiful ideals were painted for our boys who were sent out to die. **This was the \"war to end all wars.\" This was the \"war to make the world safe for democracy.\"** No one mentioned to them that their going and their dying would mean huge war profits. No one told these American soldiers that they might be shot down by bullets made by their own brothers here. No one told them that their ships might be torpedoed by submarines built with United States patents. They were just told it was to be a \"glorious adventure.\" **HOW TO SMASH THIS RACKET!** Well, it's a racket, all right. A few profit - and the many pay. But there is a way to stop it. You can't end it by disarmament conferences. You can't eliminate it by peace parleys at Geneva. Well-meaning but impractical groups can't wipe it out by resolutions. Three steps must be taken to smash the war racket: 1) **We must take the profit out of war;** 2) We must permit the youth of the land who would bear arms to decide whether or not there should be war; and 3) We must limit our military forces to home defense purposes.

I am not a fool as to believe that war is a thing of the past. I know the people do not want war, but there is no use in saying we cannot be pushed into another war. **Woodrow Wilson was re-elected president in 1916 on a platform that he had \"kept us out of war.\" Yet, five months later he asked Congress to declare war on Germany.** In that five-month interval the people had not been asked whether they had changed their minds. Then what caused our government to change its mind so suddenly? Money. An allied commission came over shortly before the war declaration and called on the President. The President summoned a group of advisers. The head of the commission spoke. Stripped of its diplomatic language, this is what he told the President and his group: \"There is no use kidding ourselves any longer. The cause of the allies is lost. We now owe you (American bankers, American munitions makers, American manufacturers, American speculators, American exporters) five or six billion dollars. If we lose (and without the help of the US we must lose) we, England, France and Italy, cannot pay back this money. So...\" **Had secrecy been outlawed as far as war negotiations, and had the press been invited to be present at that conference, America never would have entered the war.** But this conference, like all war discussions, was shrouded in utmost secrecy. When our boys were sent off, they were told it was a \"war to make the world safe for democracy\" and a \"war to end all wars.\" Very little, if anything, has been accomplished to assure us that the World War was really the war to end all wars. Disarmament conferences don't mean a thing. At all these conferences, lurking in the background are the sinister agents of those who profit by war. They see to it that these conferences do not seriously limit armaments. So...I say, TO HELL WITH WAR! **For an engaging 10-page summary of this book: [www.WantToKnow.info/warisaracket](https://www.WantToKnow.info/warisaracket) For powerful information on the war cover-up: [www.WantToKnow.info/warinformation](https://www.WantToKnow.info/warinformation)** ** ****Note:** For a print version of this two-page summary, see [https://www.WantToKnow.info/warcoverup](https://www.WantToKnow.info/warcoverup).

It is the stuff of parables and literature. It is a force in social history and political economy, from electoral campaigns to reform movements and revolutions. **But in the United States today, there's a new twist to the familiar plot. Income inequality used to be about rich versus poor, but now it's increasingly a matter of the ultra rich and everyone else.** The curious effect of the new divide is an economy that appears to be charging ahead, until you realize that the most of the people in it are being left in the dust. President Bush has yet to acknowledge the true state of affairs, though it's at the root of his failure to convince Americans that the good times are rolling. The president's lack of attention may be misplaced optimism, or it could be political strategy. Acknowledging what's happening would mean having to rethink his policies, not exactly his strong suit.

But there is no need to rely on anecdotal evidence. [Thomas Piketty](http://ideas.repec.org/e/ppi17.html), of the École Normale Supérieure in Paris, and [Emmanuel Saez](http://elsa.berkeley.edu/~saez) of the University of California at Berkeley recently updated their [groundbreaking study on income inequality](http://elsa.berkeley.edu/~saez/pikettyqje.pdf)(pdf), and their findings are striking. **The new figures show that from 2003 to 2004, the latest year for which there is data, the richest Americans pulled far ahead of everyone else. In the space of that one year, real average income for the top 1 percent of households - those making more than $315,000 in 2004 - grew by nearly 17 percent. For the remaining 99 percent, the average gain was less than 3 percent**, and that probably makes things look better than they really are, since other data, most notably from the Census Bureau, indicate that the average is bolstered by large gains among the top 20 percent of households. In all, the top 1 percent of households enjoyed 36 percent of all income gains in 2004, on top of an already stunning 30 percent in 2003. Some of the gains at the top reflect capitalism's robust reward for the founders of companies like Microsoft, Google and Dell. But most of it is due to the unprecedented largesse being heaped on executives and professionals, in the form of salary, bonuses and stock options. **A [recent study done for the Business Roundtable](http://www.businessroundtable.org/pdf/20060705002ExecutiveCompensationResearch_FWC_62906.pdf)(pdf), a lobbying group for chief executives, shows that median executive pay at 350 large public companies was $6.8 million in 2005**. According to the Wall Street Journal, that's 179 times the pay of the average American worker. The study is intended to rebut much higher estimates made by other researchers, but it does little to quell the sense that executive pay is out of whack. As the Journal's Alan Murray pointed out recently, the study's calculation of executive pay is widely criticized as an understatement because, as a measurement of the median, it is largely unaffected by the eight or nine-digit pay packages that have dominated the headlines of late. Rich people are also being made richer, [recent government data shows](http://www.nytimes.com/2006/01/29/national/29rich.html?ex=1296190800&en=784822e4b0735ee5&ei=5090&partner=rssuserland&emc=rss), by strong returns on investment income.

In 2003, the latest year for which figures are available, **the top 1 percent of households owned 57.5 percent of corporate wealth, generally dividends and capital gains, up from 53.4 percent a year earlier. ** The Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a Washington think tank, compared the latest data from Mr. Piketty and Mr. Saez to [comprehensive reports](http://cbo.gov/showdoc.cfm?index=7000&sequence=0) on income trends from the Congressional Budget Office. Every way it sliced the data, it found [a striking share of total income concentrated at the top](http://www.cbpp.org/7-10-06inc.pdf)(pdf) of the income ladder as of 2004. • The top 10 percent of households had 46 percent of the nation's income, their biggest share in all but two of the last 70 years. • The top 1 percent of households had 19.5 percent ([see graph](http://www.nytimes.com/imagepages/2006/07/18/opinion/19firstgraph.html)). **• The top one-tenth of 1 percent of households actually received nearly half of the increased share going to the top 1 percent. ** These disparaties seem large, and they are. (Though the latest availabe data is from 2004, there are virtually no signs that the basic trend has changed since then.) The top 1 percent held a bigger share of total income than at any time since 1929, except for 1999 and 2000 during the tech stock bubble. But what makes today's disparities particularly brutal is that unlike the last bull market of the late 1990's - when a proverbial rising tide was lifting all boats - the rich have been the only winners lately. According to an analysis by Goldman Sachs, **for most American households - the bottom 60 percent - average income grew by less than 20 percent from 1979 to 2004, *with virtually all of those gains occurring from the mid- to late 1990's.* Before and since, real incomes for that group have basically flatlined. ** The best-off Americans are not only winning by an extraordinary margin right now. They are the only ones who are winning at all. The result has been, as [Andrew Hacker](http://www.nybooks.com/articles/18995), a political science professor at Queens College, has observed in a recent article in the New York Review of Books, \"more billionaires, more millionaires and more six-figure families.\" As income has become more concentrated at the top, overall wealth has also become more skewed. According to the [latest installation of a survey](http://www.federalreserve.gov/pubs/feds/2006/200613/200613pap.pdf)(pdf) that the Federal Reserve has conducted every three years since 1989, **the wealthiest 1 percent of Americans accounted for 33.4 percent of total net worth in 2004,", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:060807incomeinequality.txt:2:c872dcc53b40", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 7635, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "060807incomeinequality.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "060807incomeinequality", "chunk_index": 3, "text": "Hacker](http://www.nybooks.com/articles/18995), a political science professor at Queens College, has observed in a recent article in the New York Review of Books, \"more billionaires, more millionaires and more six-figure families.\" As income has become more concentrated at the top, overall wealth has also become more skewed.

Over the same period, the other Americans in the top 10 percent saw their share of the nation's net worth basically stagnate, at about 36 percent, while the bottom 50 percent accounted for just 2.5 percent of the wealth in 2004, compared to 3.0 percent in 1989.** **II. A Brief History of Income Inequality ** While it has long been the case that the rich do better than everyone else, it has not always been true that, in the process, the poor get poorer and the middle class gets squeezed. In post-World War II America, between 1947 and the early 1970's, all income groups shared in the nation's economic growth. Poor families actually had a higher growth in real annual income than other groups. Part of the reason was a sharp rise in labor productivity. As workers produced more, the economy grew and so did compensation - wages, salaries and benefits ([see graph](http://www.nytimes.com/imagepages/2006/07/18/opinion/19secondgraph.html)). This link between productivity gains and income gains was not automatic. Government policies worked to ensure that productivity gains translated into more pay for Americans at all levels, including [regular increases in the minimum wage](http://www.bls.gov/opub/cwc/cm20030124ar04p1.htm) and greater investment in the social safety net. Full employment was also a government priority. And, of course, unions were strong back then, giving workers bargaining power. **From the mid-1970's until 1995, the trend reversed. The gap between the rich and poor widened at a rapid clip. The upper echelons - generally the top 20 percent of American households - experienced steady gains, while families in the bottom 40 percent were faced with declining or stagnating incomes. ** The growing divide coincided with a slowdown in productivity growth and a reversal in the government policies that had been promoting income equality. Legislators balked at raising the minimum wage and the earned income tax credit, a feature of the tax code that rewards the working poor by ensuring that work pays better than welfare. During the \"supply side\" era in the 1980's, fostered by the policies of Ronald Reagan, taxes became less progressive. The goal of full employment was eclipsed by a focus on inflation fighting that remains to this day. As trade began to play an ever bigger role in the American economy, manufacturing jobs diminished and labor unions declined, reducing workers' clout in setting compensation. Regulatory laxness reached its apex in [the fiscal disaster of", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:060807incomeinequality.txt:3:6b783cb4dedc", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 7636, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "060807incomeinequality.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "060807incomeinequality", "chunk_index": 4, "text": "ensuring that work pays better than welfare.

The trend toward increasing inequality was interrupted, briefly, in the late 1990's. Productivity growth rebounded, and for a half decade, all income groups participated in the prosperity. Even then, the richest Americans had the best run, propelled largely by stock market gains. In fact, when the stock market hit its all time high in 2000, post-war income concentration also peaked. But government policies of the day helped to ensure that the lower rungs also had a boost. Clinton-era welfare reforms are often cast as a success story of market-based incentives. But in fact, they were supported by a big increase in the earned income tax credit to help solidify the transition from welfare to work. At the same time, budget deficits were conquered by shared sacrifice - a mix of tax increases and spending cuts affecting all groups. The combination of economic growth and fiscal discipline spurred robust hiring and, if it had endured, could also have strengthened the Social Security safety net by allowing the government to pay down its debts. That seems like ancient history now. Nearly everyone's income fell in 2001 and 2002, due to the bursting of the Internet bubble in 2000, recession in 2001 and the ensuing jobless recovery. In the last few years, though, the trend toward inequality has reasserted itself - with a vengeance. **III. Inequality During the Bush Years ** For the last few years, the tide has been rising again, but most boats have been staying where they are, or sinking. One key reason is that the link between rising productivity and broad economic prosperity has been severed. Take another look [at this graph](http://www.nytimes.com/imagepages/2006/07/18/opinion/19secondgraph.html). **During the years that George W. Bush has been in the White House, productivity growth has been stronger than ever. But the real compensation of all but the top 20 percent of income earners has been flat or falling. Gains in wages, salaries and benefits have been increasingly concentrated at the uppermost rungs of the income ladder. ** The Bush administration would like you to believe that the situation will correct itself. Most recently, the new Treasury secretary, Henry M. Paulson, Jr., reiterated the administration's viewpoint at his confirmation hearing in June when he said that \"economic growth, job growth, productivity growth, hopefully will be followed by increases in wage", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:060807incomeinequality.txt:4:7ec87545d0ed", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 7637, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "060807incomeinequality.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "060807incomeinequality", "chunk_index": 5, "text": "percent of income earners has been flat or falling. Gains in wages, salaries and benefits have been increasingly concentrated at the uppermost rungs of the income ladder. ** The Bush administration would like you to believe that the situation will correct itself. Most recently, the new Treasury secretary, Henry M. Paulson, Jr., reiterated the administration's viewpoint at his confirmation hearing in June when he said that \"economic growth, job growth, productivity growth, hopefully will be followed by increases in wage income.\" Well, hoping certainly won't make it so. Neither will growth alone. As the post-World War II history of income inequality illustrates, productivity improvement is only one piece of the prosperity puzzle. The economic health of most American families also depends greatly on what government does. If it merely \"gets out of the way,\" inequality is bound to persist and - if recent results are any indication of future performance - worsen. The Bush administration, though, has not even done anything as benign as get out of the way. The policies it has pursued - affirmatively and aggressively - have widened the gap between rich and poor. **A. The Tax Wedge** Tax cuts are the most obvious example. The Urban Institute-Brookings Institution Tax Policy Center computed the combined effects of tax cut legislation from 2001, 2003 and 2006. The tax cuts' contribution to the income gap was significant. **In 2006, the average tax cut for households with incomes of more than $1 million - the top two-tenths of 1 percent - is $112,000 which works out to a boost of 5.7 percent in after tax income. That's considerably higher than the 5 percent boost garnered by the top 1 percent. It's far greater than the 2.5 percent increase of the middle fifth of households, and fully 19 times greater than the 0.3 percent gain of the poorest fifth of households. ** The disparities are driven by tax cuts that overwhelmingly benefit the most affluent. In 2006, for instance, a tax cut took effect that allows high income households - those with incomes above $200,000 - to take bigger write offs for their children and other expenses, like mortgage interest on a second home. And **increasingly, tax cuts are aimed at allowing America's wealthiest families to amass dynastic wealth - estates to transfer from one generation to the next virtually untouched by taxes.** The most obvious example is the gradual reduction in the estate tax that is scheduled through 2010 (and regular attempts to abolish the estate tax altogether). Another huge, though lesser noted example, is the law passed last May allowing all Americans to shelter money in a tax-favored Roth I.R.A. Under previous law, Roths had been off limits to wealthy Americans, precisely because the government did not want to help people amass big estates under the guise of saving for retirement. That sound principle has now been turned on", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:060807incomeinequality.txt:5:68542c70cb46", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 7638, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "060807incomeinequality.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "060807incomeinequality", "chunk_index": 6, "text": "in the estate tax that is scheduled through 2010 (and regular attempts to abolish the estate tax altogether).

That sound principle has now been turned on its head. **B. The Assault on Programs for the Poor and Middle Class** Tax cuts are not the only policies widening the gap between the rich and other Americans. Earlier this year, President Bush signed into law [a measure](http://www.nytimes.com/2006/01/30/politics/30budget.html) that will cut $39 billion over the next five years from domestic programs like Medicaid and food stamps, and $99.3 billion from 2006 to 2015. **The president and the Republican Congress have also done harm to the finances of the poorest Americans - and to the notion of basic fairness - by [not increasing the federal minimum wage](http://www.nytimes.com/2006/06/23/opinion/23fri2.html?ex=1308715200&en=fd9912629da79bdc&ei=5090&partner=rssuserland&emc=rss) - it has been $5.15 since 1997 While C.E.O. salaries have been soaring, the take-home pay of waitresses and janitors has been hit hard by inflation.** The Bush administration has also been trying, with mixed success so far, to pursue other policies that would have the effect of shifting money to the rich. The most ominous is its often-repeated desire to \"address our long-term unfunded entitlement obligations.\" That's code for making tax cuts for the wealthy permanent while cutting Social Security, which has for 70 years been a major factor in keeping Americans financially secure in their old age. In 2004, over the objections of Congress, [the administration overturned time-and-a-half regulation for overtime](http://www.nytimes.com/2004/08/31/national/31overtime.html?ex=1251691200&en=93683705060f853f&ei=5090&partner=rssuserland). For a brief period after Hurricane Katrina, the president [suspended by executive proclamation](http://www.nytimes.com/2005/10/17/national/nationalspecial/17immig.html?ex=1287201600&en=db6b434a1a5f0e86&ei=5090&partner=rssuserland&emc=rss) the law that requires federal contractors to pay workers the locally prevailing wage, until Congress objected. For three months after Katrina, the Labor Department suspended the law requiring federal contractors to have an affirmative action hiring plan - an invitation to discrimination and, as such, to income inequality. **C. The Too-Easy Answer** When confronted with evidence of growing income inequality, Bush administration officials invariably say the answer is more and better education. \"We are starting to see that the income gap is largely an education gap,\" said Trent Duffy, a White House spokesman, in a typical retort last January when tax data showed an increasing concentration of wealth among the highest-income Americans. Education is critically important to individuals, society, the economy and democracy itself, and deserves strong government support. But it is neither a satisfactory explanation, nor a remedy, for today's income inequality. There is a strong correlation between one's level of education and one's earning power. The Bush administration is assuming that the correlation will continue to hold in an ever more globalized economy.

But it is neither a satisfactory explanation, nor a remedy, for today's income inequality. There is a strong correlation between one's level of education and one's earning power. The Bush administration is assuming that the correlation will continue to hold in an ever more globalized economy. Writing in the March/April issue of Foreign Affairs, Princeton economist Alan S. Blinder, a former vice-chairman of the Federal Reserve, explains why that view may be mistaken: \"Other things being equal, education and skills are, of course, good things; education yields higher returns in advanced societies, and more schooling probably makes workers more flexible and more adaptable to change. But the problem with relying on education as the remedy for job losses is that 'other things' are not remotely close to equal. The critical divide in the future may instead be between those types of work that are easily deliverable through a wire (or via a wireless connection) with little or no diminution in quality and those that are not. And this unconventional divide does not correspond well to traditional distinctions between jobs that require high levels of education and jobs that don't.\" There is already evidence that the benefits of education are not as straightforward as many people seem to believe they are. In his review of \"Inequality Matters,\" a collection essays commissioned by Demos, a public policy research and advocacy organization, Mr. Hacker, the Queens College political science professor, cited findings from the Bureau of Labor Statistics to show that many college graduates now hold jobs that once required only a high school diploma. Today, according to the bureau, 37 percent of flight attendants have completed college, as have 35 percent of tour escorts, 21 percent of embalmers, and 13 percent of both security guards and casino dealers. Mr. Hacker notes that more people are expected to earn college degrees in preparation for well-paying professions. \"But we cannot expect the economy will automatically create better-paid positions to match the cohort acquiring higher education,\" he writes. Underscoring the point, **the Bush administration's own Economic Report of the President in 2006 shows that average annual earnings of college graduates fell by 5 percent from 2000 to 2004.** In those four years, the difference between the average yearly pay of a college graduate and a high school graduate shrank from 93 percent to 80 percent. Education is vital. But as Mr. Blinder put it, it \"is far from a panacea.\" **IV.

The Future of Income Inequality** The fast-growing gap between the rich and poor and middle-class Americans is not something that has just happened. The Bush policies are an attempt to dismantle the institutions and norms that have long worked to ameliorate inequities - progressive taxation, the minimum wage, Social Security, Medicaid and so on. The aims that can't be accomplished outright - like cuts in Social Security - are being teed up by running deficits that could force the shrinkage of government programs, even though the public would not likely condone many such cuts unless compelled to by a fiscal crisis. Such policies are grounded in an ideology that began taking shape some 30 years ago, when economic policy makers began to disdain the notion of harnessing and protecting society's collective potential in favor of crafting incentives to align individuals' interests with those of the market. This campaign has gone by many names - \"starve the beast,\" or \"repeal the New Deal.\" Economist [Jared Bernstein](http://www.epi.org/author_details.cfm?author_id=115) of [the Economic Policy Institute](http://www.epi.org/), a Washington think tank, calls that approach \"you're on your own,\" or YOYO, and has written a book calling for a new way, dubbed \"we're in this together,\" or WITT. ([Click here for excerpts from \"All Together Now: Common Sense for a Fair Economy,\" by Jared Bernstein](http://www.nytimes.com/2006/07/19/opinion/TPRICHexcerpt.html?pagewanted=all).) At issue, in economic terms, is the tradeoff between equality and efficiency: **It can be difficult to divide the economic pie more equally without reducing the size of the pie. But it's not impossible, and doing so is crucial for widespread prosperity. A fair and well-functioning economy will always involve some inequality, which acts a motivator and can be explained by differences in risk-taking, ability and work intensity. But inequality is generally deemed to be dangerous - socially, economically, (and, perhaps, politically)** - when it becomes so extreme as to be self-reinforcing, as many researchers suggest is currently the case. The problem now is that most any attempt to reduce inequality - even a measly increase in the minimum wage - is rejected as misguided. And policies that under one set of economic conditions might allow for a justifiable modicum of inequality are pursued beyond all reason. For instance, **the rationale for the tax cuts in 2001 was to return the budget surplus that Mr. Bush inherited from President Clinton. The rationale for the tax cuts in 2002 and 2003 and 2006 was to stimulate the economy. The surplus has long since been replaced by big deficits, the jobless recovery ended three years ago and inequality is on the rise.

A new book by 9/11 commission co-chairmen Tom Kean and Lee Hamilton outlines repeated misstatements by the Pentagon and Federal Aviation Administration. They write, \"Fog of war could explain why some people were confused on the day of 9/11. But it could not explain why all of the after-action reports, accident investigations and public testimony by FAA and NORAD officials advanced an account of 9/11 that was untrue.\" Untrue, the military's original timeline of United Flight 93. The military said FAA notified NORAD of a hijacked plane at 9:16 a.m., 47 minutes before the plane crashed in Pennsylvania. In fact, the military found out three minutes after the plane crashed. And equally untrue, the government's timeline for American Flight 77 and details about fighter jets scrambled to intercept it. The book also alleges government officials weren't forthcoming with the investigation and it took interviews and subpoenas to shake loose valuable information. A Pentagon audit declassified last year found \"DOD did not accurately report to the 9/11 Commission on the response to the September 11th, 2001 hijackings.\" Pentagon investigators blamed \"insufficient forensic capabilities\" and worse. Admits, \"DOD might not be able to sufficiently capture and report on actions taken in response to a future significant air event.\" Still, so far government investigators stopped short of calling all these inaccuracies lies. ROMANS: Investigations are under way by the inspectors general of the Pentagon and the Department of Transportation to find out just why the FAA and NORAD didn't tell the truth. Now, Kean and Hamilton say all the inaccuracies have fueled conspiracy theorists, they've stymied the investigation, and Lou, damaged the credibility of this government.

In 1976, [Muhammad Yunus](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muhammad_Yunus) founded the Grameen Bank to make small loans of about $100 to poor people with a business plan in his home country of Bangladesh. **Since then the Grameen Bank has issued [more than US$ 5 billion](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grameen_Bank) to help literally millions of poor around the globe to pull out of poverty.** To ensure repayment, the bank uses a system of \"solidarity groups.\" These small informal groups apply together for loans and its members act as co-guarantors of repayment and support one another's efforts at economic self-advancement. The system has been tremendously successful. I have little doubt that once enough people see the incredible value of this system, we can and eventually will end poverty in this world. Below is an engaging interview with Mr. Yunus in my very favorite magazine-*[Ode](http://www.odemagazine.com)*. For those who don't know about the microlending movement started by Yunus, a microloan of $100 can very often pull an entire family in the developing world out of poverty in as little as one year. As this is by far the most powerful way of investing money for a better world I've found, I have invested all of my retirement money in microlending. **To learn how you can pull several families out of poverty every year with only a $1,000 investment and still make a return on your investment, see [https://www.weboflove.org/051023microcredit](https://www.weboflove.org/051023microcredit).** By each of us choosing to use our money to better the world, we can powerfully build a brighter future for us all.

If you want to solve poverty, you have to put people in a position to build their own life. Unfortunately, this is not how the aid industry works. Western governments and development organizations think they need to offer permanent charity. As a result, they keep entire economies in poverty and families in an inhuman situation.\"** Well that's something! Over the past 30 plus years, Bangladesh has received more than 23 billion euros ($30 billion U.S.) in aid and loans-and now an ungrateful Bangladeshi banker is criticizing the West for its generosity? But beware. It's unfair to judge Muhammad Yunus as a man spreading rebellious ideas about development aid. Yunus is the undisputed leader of a radical new counteroffensive in the battle against poverty. **As founder of the Grameen Bank, he is the creator of a concept that now represents an emerging force in the financial world: microcredit, small loans for poor people. Grameen has become a model for banks in nearly 100 countries, both in the West and the developing world. ** A former economics professor, who holds honorary doctorates from 22 universities in 11 countries, Yunus has seen for himself what works and what doesn't work in Bangladesh, just about the poorest country in the world. He has witnessed how billions of dollars in foreign aid have created colossal projects (dams, bridges, huge industrial plants) but not created a situation in which the local population had to organize itself to solve its own problems.

And that, according to Yunus, holds the key to a world without poverty. He outlined these ideas quite boldly and eloquently during our interview, quoted below: \"Poor people are not the authors of their poverty. Poverty is a creation of a complex system of conceptions, rules and attitudes we have thought up ourselves. Therefore, if you want to eradicate poverty you have to go back to the drawing board, discover where we have planted the seeds of poverty and make changes there.\" \"This is how I figured out that our financial institutions have incorporated an enormously high threshold-collateral, which means that poor people, who so desperately need credit to escape their poverty, never set foot in a bank. They'd be laughed at. **We believe that poor people will never repay their loans. We consider it normal that banks-like other companies-must turn a profit and that they exclude some 70, 80 percent of the world population.** Those assumptions are not up for discussion; this is simply the way it is. In reality, no one has ever tested those ideas. After all, what bank lends money to poor people?\" \"The approach to poverty is thwarted by our fixed convictions. Poor people are helpless, unhealthy, illiterate and thus stupid, they have nothing, they know nothing, we must take care of them, we must give them food... It is completely wrong to think like this.** I am convinced that poor people are just as human as anyone else.** They have just as much potential as anyone. They are simply shoved into a box marked POOR! And it's written in giant letters so that everyone simply treats them the way poor people are treated, because we think this is the way we should treat them. This means it isn't easy to get out of the box.\" \"This applies to individuals just as it does to countries. Governments in developing countries receive money from wealthy governments that are kind enough to contribute a portion of their national income to what is referred to as \"development aid.\" This required charity towards poorer countries has become a credential that is not questioned nearly enough.

I'm also talking about the wealthy, western countries where you have designed a great big box called \"social welfare.\" You say: oh, he is ill, he is handicapped, he can't take care of himself, it is society's responsibility to keep him alive. I think that's completely wrong. That way of thinking creates a divide between those who work and can take care of themselves and those who cannot.\" \"And what happens? If you're one of the unlucky few, you'll get a benefit payment every month. **The message is clear: you can't do anything, the government has to take care of you. So you become dependent.** You get used to having society give you money. You get it, you don't have to do anything for it, you don't have to justify it. That is deadly to your initiative and you start waiting for more aid. That's when they've broken your creativity. They've taken away a fundamental human element.\" \"This social welfare system creates a human zoo. The animals in the zoo are given their meals on time and a doctor comes by when they're sick, but they are living in captivity. They still have a vague instinct that tells them they should hunt, but they aren't challenged to go hungry for days on end and hunt prey. The animals aren't as sharp and inventive as they would be in nature. What about them is actually still animalistic? They have become a poor imitation of themselves. By the same token, people who are swallowed up in the western social welfare system are also no longer themselves. They aren't stimulated to discover their possibilities, talents and creativity. They are robbed of every challenge. They are curbed in their development.\" \"Poor people don't need to think of themselves as poor and sit and wait for charity that won't ultimately save them. We can dispel poverty. And we were making good progress. The United Nations had established the Millennium Development Goals: poverty was to be cut in half by 2015 and completely eradicated by 2050. Never before had mankind set such a courageous goal for itself. We had a joint goal we were excited about, with which we ushered in a new millennium.\" \"And then came \"9/11.\" That day plunged the entire world into confusion.

And I'm not just saying that because it sounds positive. I really mean it.** Every country, every city, every village can halve the number of poor people. Come on, 10 years is a long time!\" \"To solve the problem of poverty, you have to start thinking differently. You have to treat poor people the way you want to be treated. You have to offer them the same facilities you have access to.

For centuries, the supply of news has been dominated by journalists: an elite, in fact, that decided which information was appropriate to pass on and which was not.

But thanks to the internet, a whole range of news sources has emerged that I can look to for information-from independent organizations to private weblogs around the world.

They are now plugged in to the rest of the world.\"** \"It is a good development that farmers are involved in the world economy, but it is not a panacea. Our textbooks have greatly simplified the world economy: it's an open market, it's a free world. But just try and launch a medicine on the Japanese market; they'll tell you all about the rules.

I'm talking about a new sector: companies that don't want to make a loss, so they can continue to do business that contributes to the community as a whole.

You signed up to work at a social service institution or became a researcher so you could develop medicines to cure people's ills-and which, by the way, would lavishly line the pockets of others. But there is another, more challenging, way: via the business community. Because I believe there is no better way to combine your desire for a better world with effectiveness than through a company.\" Effectiveness. That's the key word coming from Muhammad Yunus. Effectiveness is an idea remarkably absent from many discussions about combating global poverty. All too often, efforts to bring prosperity to developing countries stall in good intentions, bureaucracy, pricey consultants and results that make too little difference in the actual lives of poor people. Muhammad Yunus refuses to accept this as the best we can do. **Yunus has demonstrated that combating poverty starts with action. And that these actions can sometimes even make a profit. ** \"Sometimes I dream of an international stock exchange where 'social companies' are listed,\" Yunus continues. \"If you want to help poor women in Latin America, you can invest in a Bolivian internet company that sells clothing made by local women. If you have more affinity with new technology, you can invest in a Vietnamese company that brings computers with speech technology to villages. **Universities should set up business schools for young social entrepreneurs who don't learn how to make as much money as possible but the best way to realize a social goal.** And there should be a Wall Street Journal that reports on this new group of companies.

With two years completely immersed in another world away from family and friends, I'd had plenty of opportunities to reflect on my life back home. In those periods of contemplation, **I felt a deep sense of satisfaction in realizing that I had come to really enjoy my relationships with all of my friends and family back home with only one major exception - Dad. ** As a child, I had very mixed feelings about my father. He took us on wonderful, exciting vacations car camping around the country for a month out of each year. In his engaging moments with me and my sister and two brothers, he could be adventurous, enthusiastic, and a lot of fun. Yet, like so many fathers out there, most of the time he was distant and unavailable. As a minister and a fighter for peace and justice, dad's work was by far his greatest passion, with family a distant second. What's more, at meals - our only regular gathering time each day - dad would all too often preach politics to us, his unwilling captive audience. There was no debating him, either. He was always right. Yet in looking back, **I could see now what I once would never have admitted - that I was just as stubborn as dad.** There was no way I would acknowledge that he was right in a debate or argument. I would argue with him fiercely, yet still he managed to get me every time. I remember countless times when our interactions ended with me stalking off frustrated and angry, as dad settled back triumphantly into his chair reading the newspaper. Sometimes I just hated him. His righteous attitude seemed so hypocritical and just wrong! After moving away from home at age 18, I had dedicated myself to improving my relationships with my family and others in my life.

Thanks to some wonderful divine guidance, I had been successful with everyone except dad. He was the one person I still just couldn't get along with. As I contemplated leaving the wonderfully rich experience in China, I knew that the time had come to change this. I knew that on getting home after having been away for two years, if I wanted to get along better with him, my job was to learn to let dad be dad. I realized that I could not change him, but I could change myself by letting go of my need to be right and of my harsh judgments of him and his behavior. I knew that If I wanted to change our frustrating dynamic, I was the one who would have to change. The idea came to me that the best way to heal this old family wound was to move in with dad and make a commitment to opening my heart and to becoming friends with him for the first time in my life. I knew it would not be easy. Yet I also knew that if I could hold fast to my intention of not letting his comments get to me and not needing to be right, we could have a breakthrough. I wrote dad a letter asking if he was interested in becoming friends, and if he would be open to my living with him on return from China to work on this. **Dad was thrilled at the idea of us becoming friends and warmly welcomed me into his home.** He was very supportive of my desire to move through our difficulties. He even spruced up a little room in his house for me. Yet after a brief, enjoyable \"honeymoon\" period of about two months, I found those same old patterns staring me right in the face again. Dad again was always right and I ended up leaving frustrated, knowing that I was actually right - just like old times. Why did it always have to end up that way? Yet I held to my commitment.

Even though I still didn't agree with him, I slowly learned to simply listen and to be OK with letting dad have the last word. I couldn't change his behavior or beliefs, but I was gradually changing mine. **Those few months were tough. It's not easy to break deeply ingrained family patterns, but I was committed.** Every time things spun out of control, I reminded myself of my deep intention to become friends with dad and even to love him. By holding strong to that commitment, I got increasingly better at pulling back whenever our talks didn't feel supportive. By the end of six months, I had done it! I could sit through a conversation where dad was telling me how I was wrong and feel no need to engage or respond. When he challenged or blamed me, I could just let him have his say. I learned to just acknowledge that I heard him, remembering not to take anything personally and to just let dad be dad. As I got better at this, **I eventually came to understand that dad was not consciously trying to attack me. He was just playing out old patterns and programming within himself.** I could accept and even love him just the way he was - even the part of him that wouldn't admit he was wrong. Dad seemed to notice the difference, too. I especially remember one particular day when dad was doing his thing. I simply nodded my head occasionally and said \"I hear you, dad,\" without feeling any need to defend myself. At one point he fell silent and I just sat quietly waiting. Then I heard words I don't think I'd ever heard him say in these circumstances, \"Well Fred, what do you think?\" And for the first time, I felt my dad was really listening to me. From that point on, though we still would hit occasional rough spots, dad and I began having meaningful conversations. He became increasingly interested in my opinion and his tone of voice lost that cutting edge. For the first time ever, we were actually friends!

Your eye will naturally jump to the top of the screen, where huge fountains of dark debris erupt out of the falling towers. But fight your natural instincts. Look farther down, at the stories that haven't collapsed yet. In almost every clip you'll see little puffs of dust spurting out from the sides of the towers. There are two competing explanations for these puffs of dust: 1) the force of the collapsing upper floors raised the air pressure in the lower ones so dramatically that it actually blew out the windows. And 2) the towers did not collapse from the impact of two Boeing 767s and the ensuing fires. They were destroyed in a planned, controlled demolition. The dust puffs you see on film are the detonations of explosives planted there before the attacks. People who believe the second explanation live in a very different world from those who believe the first. In world No. 2, al-Qaeda is not responsible for the destruction of the World Trade Center. The U.S. government is. The Pentagon was not hit by a commercial jet; it was hit by a cruise missile. United Flight 93 did not crash after its occupants rushed the cockpit; it was deliberately taken down by a U.S. Air Force fighter. The entire catastrophe was planned and executed by federal officials in order to provide the U.S. with a pretext for going to war in the Middle East and, by extension, as a means of consolidating and extending the power of the Bush Administration. The population of world No. 2 is larger than you might think. **A Scripps-Howard poll of 1,010 adults last month found that 36% of Americans consider it \"very likely\" or \"somewhat likely\" that government officials either allowed the attacks to be carried out or carried out the attacks themselves.

Thirty-six percent adds up to a lot of people. This is not a fringe phenomenon. It is a mainstream political reality.** **Although the 9/11 Truth Movement, as many conspiracy believers refer to their passion, has been largely ignored by the mainstream media, it is flourishing on the Internet. One of the most popular conspiracy videos online is [Loose Change](https://www.WantToKnow.info/060407bestdocumentary9-11), a 90-min. blizzard of statistics, photographs, documents, eyewitness accounts and expert testimony set to a trippy hip-hop backbeat. It's designed to pick apart, point by point, the conventional narrative of what happened on Sept. 11, 2001.** For all its amateur production values--it was created by a pair of industrious twentysomethings using a laptop, pizza money and footage scavenged from the Internet--Loose Change is a compelling experience. Take the section about the attack on the Pentagon. As the film points out--and this is a tent-pole issue among 9/11 conspiracists--the crash site doesn't look right. There's not enough damage. The hole smashed in the Pentagon's outer wall was 75 ft. wide, but a Boeing 757 has a 124-ft. wingspan. Why wasn't the hole wider? Why does it look so neat? Experts will tell you that the hole was punched by the plane's fuselage, not its wings, which sheared off on impact. But then what happened to the wings? And the tail and the engines? Images of the crash site show hardly any of the wreckage you would expect from a building that's been rammed by a commercial jet. The lawn, where the plane supposedly dragged a wing on approach, is practically pristine. The plane supposedly clipped five lampposts on its way in, but the lampposts in question show surprisingly little damage. And could Hani Hanjour, the man supposedly at the controls, have executed the maneuvers that the plane performed? He failed a flight test just weeks before the attack. And Pentagon employees reported smelling cordite after the hit, the kind of high explosive a cruise missile carries. There's something empowering about just exploring such questions.** Loose Change appeals to the viewer's common sense: it tells you to forget the official explanations and the expert testimony, and trust your eyes and your brain instead. It implies that the world can be grasped by laymen without any help or interference from the talking heads. Watching Loose Change, you feel as if you are participating in the great American tradition of self-reliance and nonconformist, antiauthoritarian dissent.** You're fighting the power.

You're thinking different. (Conspiracists call people who follow the government line \"sheeple.\") \"The goal of the movie was just really to get out there and show that there are alternate stories to what the mainstream media and the government will tell you,\" says Korey Rowe, 23, who produced the movie. \"That 19 hijackers are going to completely bypass security and crash four commercial airliners in a span of two hours, with no interruption from the military forces, in the most guarded airspace in the United States and the world? That to me is a conspiracy theory.\" It's also not much of a story line. As a narrative, the official story that the government--echoed by the media--is trying to sell shows an almost embarrassing lack of novelistic flair, whereas the story the conspiracy theorists tell about what happened on Sept. 11 is positively Dan Brownesque in its rich, exciting complexity. Rowe and his collaborator, Dylan Avery, 22, actually started writing Loose Change as a fictional screenplay--\"loosely based around us discovering that 9/11 was an inside job,\" Rowe says--before they became convinced that the evidence of conspiracy was overwhelming. The Administration is certainly playing its part in the drama with admirable zeal. If we went to war to root out fictional weapons of mass destruction, is staging a fictional terrorist attack such a stretch? But there's a big problem with Loose Change and with most other conspiracy theories. The more you think about them, the more you realize how much they depend on circumstantial evidence, facts without analysis or documentation, quotes taken out of context and the scattered testimony of traumatized eyewitnesses. (For what it's worth, the National Institute of Standards and Technology has published a fact sheet responding to some of the conspiracy theorists' ideas on its website, [www.nist.gov.](http://www.nist.gov.) The theories prompt small, reasonable questions that demand answers that are just too large and unreasonable to swallow. Granted, the Pentagon crash site looks odd in photographs. But if the Pentagon was hit by a cruise missile, then what happened to American Airlines Flight 77? Where did all the real, documented people on it go? Assassinated? Relocated? What about eyewitnesses who saw a plane, not a missile? And what are the chances that an operation of such size--it would surely have involved hundreds of military and civilian personnel--could be carried out without a single leak? Without leaving behind a single piece of evidence hard enough to stand up to scrutiny in a court? People, the feds just aren't", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:060903time.911conspiracies.txt:2:1cfd88d3004c", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 7661, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "060903time.911conspiracies.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "060903time.911conspiracies", "chunk_index": 3, "text": "what happened to American Airlines Flight 77?

Without leaving behind a single piece of evidence hard enough to stand up to scrutiny in a court? People, the feds just aren't that slick. Nobody is. There are psychological explanations for why conspiracy theories are so seductive. Academics who study them argue that they meet a basic human need: to have the magnitude of any given effect be balanced by the magnitude of the cause behind it. A world in which tiny causes can have huge consequences feels scary and unreliable. Therefore a grand disaster like Sept. 11 needs a grand conspiracy behind it. \"We tend to associate major events--a President or princess dying--with major causes,\" says Patrick Leman, a lecturer in psychology at Royal Holloway University of London, who has conducted studies on conspiracy belief. \"If we think big events like a President being assassinated can happen at the hands of a minor individual, that points to the unpredictability and randomness of life and unsettles us.\" In that sense, the idea that there is a malevolent controlling force orchestrating global events is, in a perverse way, comforting. You would have thought the age of conspiracy theories might have declined with the rise of digital media. The assassination of President John F. Kennedy was a private, intimate affair compared with the attack on the World Trade Center, which was witnessed by millions of bystanders and television viewers and documented by hundreds of Zapruders. You would think there was enough footage and enough forensics to get us past the grassy knoll and the magic bullet, to create a consensus reality, a single version of the truth, a single world we can all live in together. But there is no event so plain and clear that a determined human being can't find ambiguity in it. And as divisive as they are, conspiracy theories are part of the process by which Americans deal with traumatic public events like Sept. 11. Conspiracy theories form around them like scar tissue. In a curious way, they're an American form of national mourning. They'll be with us as long as we fear lone gunmen, and feel the pain of losses like the one we suffered on Sept. 11, and as long as the past, even the immediate past, is ultimately unknowable. That is to say, forever. ** **For a 10-page summary of 9/11 conspiracies, [www.WantToKnow.info/9-11cover-up10pg](https://www.WantToKnow.info/911/9-11-facts)** **For a powerful video on 9/11: [www.WantToKnow.info/060407bestdocumentary9-11](https://www.WantToKnow.info/060407bestdocumentary9-11)** **For reliable resources on 9/11 conspiracies and what you can do: [9/11 information center](https://www.WantToKnow.info/911information)**** **See our [exceptional archive](https://www.WantToKnow.info/indexnewsarticles) of revealing news articles.** **Please support this important work:", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:060903time.911conspiracies.txt:3:a74f9f5a9f32", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 7662, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "060903time.911conspiracies.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "060903time.911conspiracies", "chunk_index": 4, "text": "as we fear lone gunmen, and feel the pain of losses like the one we suffered on Sept. 11, and as long as the past, even the immediate past, is ultimately unknowable.

But unreasonable questions resonate with the reasonable. Colleen Kelly's brother, a salesman, had breakfast at the Windows on the World restaurant on Sept. 11. After he died she founded September Eleventh Families for Peaceful Tomorrows to oppose the Iraq war. She lives in the Bronx and gives a gingerly embrace to the conspiracy crowd. \"Sometimes I listen to them and I think that's *sooooo* outlandish and bizarre,\" she says. \"But that day had such disastrous geopolitical consequences. If David Ray Griffin asks uncomfortable questions and points out painful discrepancies? Good for him.\" **Griffin's book, \"The New Pearl Harbor: Disturbing Questions About the Bush Administration and 9/11,\" never reviewed in a major U.S. newspaper, sold more than 100,000 copies and became a movement founding stone. Last year he traveled through New England, giving speeches in whitewashed churches and gymnasiums. He came to West Hartford, Conn., on a rainy autumn evening. Four hundred mostly middle-aged and upper-middle-class doctors and lawyers, teachers and social workers sat waiting.** ****'Domestic terrorists'**** Griffin took the podium and laid down his ideas with calm and cool. He concluded: \"It is already possible to know beyond a reasonable doubt one very important thing: The destruction of the World Trade Center was an inside job, orchestrated by domestic terrorists,\" he says. \"The welfare of our republic and perhaps even the survival of our civilization depend on getting the truth about 9/11 exposed.\" The audience rose and applauded for more than a minute. *\"Reality is a thin line between denial and paranoia.\"* -- Author unknown, but often quoted by the 9/11 truth movement \"Me?\" You've asked the Rev. Frank Morales, the bohemian Episcopalian minister with the hipster goatee, where he stands on the nature of the conspiracy. We're standing in the ancient graveyard of St. Mark's Church in the Bowery on Second Avenue. \"I lean to LIHOP.\" The 9/11 truthers share a lieutenant colonel's love of acronyms. They divide themselves into LIHOPS and MIHOPS and differences are not trifling. LIHOP stands for \"Let It Happen On Purpose,\" which means someone inside the U.S. government intentionally let the terror conspiracy go. MIHOP means \"Made It Happen On Purpose,\" and its gradations center on whether Bush was in or out of the loop (a surprising number believe he was clueless) and whether the Mossad or British intelligence was dealt into the deal. Morales, 57, who came out of the Lower East Side housing projects, spent days at Ground Zero performing last rites for the dead, many little more than a collection of body parts. \"I didn't presume to know who did it,\" he says. \"There was a lot of shucking and jiving.

I wonder at what point massive incompetence crosses over into negligent homicide.\" To make sense of the truth movement's anger, you need to hit the rewind button to early 2001, with the hindsight of today. There was, as the 9/11 Commission hearings made clear, a bad moon rising. Warnings kept coming of a \"high probability\" of a \"spectacular\" terrorist attack. A national security adviser warned Condoleezza Rice there were terrorist cells, probably al-Qaeda guys, in the country. CIA chief George Tenet said the \"system was blinking red.\" A presidential bulletin on Aug. 6 had a catchy title: \"Bin Laden Determined to Strike in U.S.\" Bush did not discuss it again with Tenet before Sept. 11. So give the truth movement, many of whom are based in New York City, their props. They may be paranoid, but something nasty came our way. They pore over the paper trail with a Sherlock Holmesian intensity, alert to intriguing discrepancy. Such as: **Former transporation secretary Norman Mineta told the commission he arrived in the presidential operations center -- under the White House -- at 9:20 a.m. on Sept. 11 and found Vice President Cheney. When an aide asked Cheney about the hijacked plane fast approaching the Pentagon, Mineta says the vice president snapped that the \"orders still stand.\" Mineta assumed the orders were to shoot the plane down. Conspiracy theorists interpret this to mean: Don't shoot it down.** **Cheney later said he was not in the operations center until after the plane hit. The commission never mentioned Mineta's contradictory version.** In September 2001, NORAD generals said they learned of the hijackings in time to scramble fighter jets. But the government recently released tapes claiming to show the FAA did not tell the military about the hijackings until three of the four planes had crashed. **That would mean the FAA repeatedly lied. It would also mean, as Griffin points out, that the entire military chain of command stayed quiet about huge inaccuracies for four years \"even though . . . the true story would put the military in a better light.\"** More mysteries pile up. The 9/11 Commission says Flight 77 hit the Pentagon at 9:37. But Honegger says clocks stopped at the Pentagon at 9:32. Then there's the collapse of the twin towers, which Jones, the physics professor, timed at just short of free fall.

Then there's the collapse of the twin towers, which Jones, the physics professor, timed at just short of free fall. Griffin cites firefighters, including a captain, who said in hearings and on tapes from that day that they saw flashes and heard the sound of explosions before the collapse. \"It's like the Nazi-facilitated Reichstag fire,\" Honegger says from her home in California. \"They guided and secretly protected it to justify their global agenda.\" Let's put aside the could-anyone-do-something-that-spectacularly-twisted? question and touch on practicalities. Isn't the problem with big ugly conspiracies -- from the Gulf of Tonkin to My Lai to the 1961 [Pentagon plan to provoke a war by attacking Americans](https://www.WantToKnow.info/010501operationnorthwoods) and blaming it on Castro -- that they are too big and ugly to keep secret? Griffin shrugs. History is littered with government black-bag jobs. \"How do you know they can't keep big secrets? Can you be sure you know what you don't know?\" There is a \"morning after\" quality to the conspiratorial romance. One moment you groove on the epiphanies and the next moment you're lost in a dull haze of \"this cannot be a coincidence,\" \"perhaps significantly\" and \"if so . . .\" What of incompetence? Or the raw absurdity of life? The truth movement makes much of a [2001 BBC report](https://www.WantToKnow.info/9-11timeline60pg#hijackersalive)that a half-dozen of the hijackers were still alive. They mention Waleed al Shehri, a pilot who still flies commercial runs in Morocco. But the BBC retracted that. It turns out the live guy and the dead hijacker spelled their names differently. Then there's the theory that Flight 77 did not hit the Pentagon and United 93 did not crash in Shanksville, Pa. But, like, what happened to the passengers? (Among the passengers on Flight 77 was Barbara Olson, wife of former U.S. solicitor general Ted Olson). ****'They don't do their homework'**** \"Why should any of us know where it went?\" Griffin says. \"It could have been it crashed in Kentucky. We don't need a theory where it went.\" Chip Berlet, senior analyst at Political Research Associates, a Boston-based left-leaning think tank, is no fan of the 9/11 Commission. He believes a serious investigation should have led to indictments and the firing of incompetent generals and civilian officials. But he has no patience with the conspiracy theorists. \"They don't do their homework; it's a kind of charlatanism,\" Berlet says over the phone. \"They say there's no debris on the lawn in front of the Pentagon, but they base their analysis on *a photo on the* *Internet* .

Bull!\" Eager says. \"What's the technique? If 200,000 tons gives way, where do you think it's going? Straight down.\" In the days after Sept. 11, experts claimed temperatures reached 2,000 degrees on the upper floors. Others claimed steel melted. Nope. What happened, Eager says, is that jet fuel sloshed around and beams got rubbery. \"It's not too much to think that you could have some regions at 900 degrees and others at 1,200 degrees, and that will distort the beams.\" The truth movement doesn't really care for Eager. A Web site casts a fisheye of suspicion at the professor and his colleagues. \"Did the MIT have prior knowledge?\" notes one chat room. \"This is for sure another speculative topic . . . \" *\"It is no measure of health to be sane in an insane society.\"* -- Krishnamurti Nico Haupt, a gaunt fellow in black sneakers, black socks, black jeans and black T-shirt, stands up in St. Mark's Church in the Bowery. He holds aloft two blue Oreos boxes taped to resemble the twin towers. A pen juts out, kind of like a Boeing airplane. For an hour he's shown videos of planes hitting the towers. If you note the glinting sunlight and angle of wings and you're honest about vectors and maybe the hashish is kicking in, you'll realize *there were no planes* . Truth movement veterans distance themselves from Haupt, who has a bit of a temper. But Reynolds, the former Labor Department economist, also is a \"no-planer.\" \"There were no planes, there were no hijackers,\" Reynolds insists. \"I know, I know, I'm out of the mainstream, but that's the way it is.\" But what about all those New Yorkers who saw airplanes hitting the twin towers? A chuckle rumbles down the phone line. \"I don't believe anyone in Lower Manhattan,\" he says. \"You hire three dozen Actors' Equity dudes and they'll say *anything*.\" Some days the 9/11 truth movement resembles an Italian coalition government -- dissolution is a certainty.

After many rich years working for global peace in various capacities, David and colleague Mel Duncan conceived the idea of the [Nonviolent Peaceforce](http://www.nonviolentpeaceforce.org) in 1999. This empowering organization has grown to become a federation of over 100 member and supporting organizations from around the world that is endorsed by nine Nobel Peace Laureates. The Nonviolent Peaceforce believes that through promoting and facilitating meaningful dialogue and mutual understanding, it is possible to address and resolve global conflicts without resorting to war. **David's life is filled with miraculous stories rooted in his unwavering commitment to resolve conflict in a peaceful, caring manner.** Below are excerpts from a 2002 article in the *Bangkok Post* about David and the Nonviolent Peaceforce. The story there of David's life or death confrontation during the civil rights movement of the '60s is one of the most moving stories ever told. Read the article below and open to the possibility that when any one of us [deeply believes in something](https://www.weboflove.org/lifepurposeintentions), we can make a big difference in our world. **Marching in Gandhi's footsteps** By Kate Rope for the *Bangkok Post * David Hartsough is quietly building an army. A veteran of the civil rights struggle in the US and a peace activist who's been on the front lines of some of the most destructive clashes of the last half century, **Hartsough is traveling the globe to rally a force that will march into the danger zones of the world armed with only a commitment to peace.** Born from the work left unfinished by Mahatma Gandhi some 70 years ago, it's a hard-sell in times like these, but Hartsough is an experienced and persuasive salesman. He knows nonviolence can work because he has spent his life in the field. Hartsough's early teachers were Gandhi, whom he read as a child, Martin Luther King, whom he met as a teenager, and his father, who risked his life in the early years of the Israeli-Palestinian crisis. A Congregationalist minister who later became a Quaker, Hartsough's father went to the Middle East when David was eight years old to bring tents and medicine to refugees displaced by the first Israel-Palestine war. \"My father gave sermons in church", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:060922nonviolentpeaceforce.txt:0:22b1c53aa487", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 7677, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "060922nonviolentpeaceforce.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "060922nonviolentpeaceforce", "chunk_index": 1, "text": "his life in the field. Hartsough's early teachers were Gandhi, whom he read as a child, Martin Luther King, whom he met as a teenager, and his father, who risked his life in the early years of the Israeli-Palestinian crisis. A Congregationalist minister who later became a Quaker, Hartsough's father went to the Middle East when David was eight years old to bring tents and medicine to refugees displaced by the first Israel-Palestine war. \"My father gave sermons in church on the Good Samaritan story, and it really impressed me that he was not just preaching it but was willing to risk his life on the belief that 'everyone is my neighbor','' he recalls. Hartsough's father also took his teenage son to see the work Martin Luther King was doing in Montgomery, Alabama, to secure equal rights for black citizens of the United States. \"I was very deeply moved that these people, who were facing such oppression, were determined to get justice, but they were determined to do that non-violently, even against people who were bombing their churches and their homes. That put me on the road to a much deeper understanding of non-violence,'' says Hartsough. After a year spent at an elite, almost entirely white college on the East Coast of the United States, Hartsough heard that Howard University, a black college in Washington, DC, needed white students. Deciding to practice what he was preaching, he transferred to Howard in 1959, and there he received a lesson more valuable than anything else he could have learned: the power of peaceful resistance. In 1960, all across the southern states of the US, people began protesting the [racial] segregation of lunch counters. So, **every Saturday, Hartsough and his black friends would leave DC, which had already been desegregated, and cross into Maryland. They would sit at a lunch counter there until they were arrested.** After spending the weekend in jail singing freedom songs, they'd be released in time for classes on Monday, only to be back in action the following Saturday. Hartsough stayed clear of nearby Virginia, which was home not only to the American Nazi Party, but also to a law that mandated a year's prison sentence and a thousand-dollar fine to anyone who protested at a lunch counter. \"We didn't have a thousand dollars, and we didn't want to spend a year in prison,'' says Hartsough laughing. But when months passed and no one challenged the racist law there, he and his friends mustered their courage, did some extra training in nonviolence, and crossed the state line. ** \"Twelve of us went in and sat down at this lunch counter at the People's Drugstore in Arlington, Virginia, and within minutes there were cars and sirens coming from all directions. They didn't arrest us, but neither were they going to serve us any food. We stayed there for two days,", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:060922nonviolentpeaceforce.txt:1:1f7b7c437367", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 7678, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "060922nonviolentpeaceforce.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "060922nonviolentpeaceforce", "chunk_index": 2, "text": "months passed and no one challenged the racist law there, he and his friends mustered their courage, did some extra training in nonviolence, and crossed the state line. ** \"Twelve of us went in and sat down at this lunch counter at the People's Drugstore in Arlington, Virginia, and within minutes there were cars and sirens coming from all directions. They didn't arrest us, but neither were they going to serve us any food. We stayed there for two days, and it was the most difficult two days of my life.'' Hartsough and his friends endured vicious name-calling, lit cigarettes being dropped down their shirts, punches so hard they were knocked off their stools to the floor where they were kicked, and members of the American Nazi Party sporting swastikas and brandishing photos of apes, asking malevolently, \"Is we or is we ain't equal?''** ** At the end of the second day, as Hartsough sat in meditation trying to think about loving his enemies, a man approached him from behind. \"He said to me, 'you nigger-lover', and he had this horrible look of hatred on his face; 'if you don't get out of this store in two seconds, I'm going to stab this through your heart'.'' In the man's hand was a switchblade. \"I had two seconds to decide if I really believed in nonviolence, and I looked this man right in the eye, and I said, 'Friend, do what you believe is right, and I'll still try and love you.' It was quite amazing, because his jaw began to fall and his hand began to drop and then he left the store.''** The most difficult part was to come. The protest had been on newspaper front pages. An angry crowd of 500 had gathered outside the drugstore, armed with rocks and firecrackers and threatening to kill the 12. \"Some friendly newspaper reporters had their cars outside and got us out of there alive.\" For their part, Hartsough and his friends decided to write to Arlington's religious and political leaders asking for local eating establishments to be opened to everyone. \"We said that if nothing changed in a week, we'd come back. We went back to Washington and for six days we were shaking and wondering, 'Do we have the courage to go back and do it again?''' But they didn't have to make that choice. **On the sixth day, the call came that the lunch counters in Arlington were now open to all. \"That taught me a very powerful lesson,'' says Hartsough, \"That by acting on our conscience, we got those people to act on their conscience, and those people got the society to act on its conscience. You don't need millions of people ... even a few can make change.''** Having this and many more experiences like it under his belt, Hartsough and others have created the Global", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:060922nonviolentpeaceforce.txt:2:2632dd14381d", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 7679, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "060922nonviolentpeaceforce.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "060922nonviolentpeaceforce", "chunk_index": 3, "text": "the call came that the lunch counters in Arlington were now open to all. \"That taught me a very powerful lesson,'' says Hartsough, \"That by acting on our conscience, we got those people to act on their conscience, and those people got the society to act on its conscience. You don't need millions of people ... even a few can make change.''** Having this and many more experiences like it under his belt, Hartsough and others have created the Global Nonviolent Peace Force with the belief that small numbers can make a big difference. The Peace Force is a corps of civilians trained in active nonviolent techniques that will be sent to areas of conflict around the world to protect human rights and create the space for peaceful resolution of differences. At the invitation of NGOs or other parties, the corps will enter combat areas to provide unarmed escorts for peaceworkers and training in active nonviolence, as well as summon the attention of the world. Hartsough already has 10 informal invitations from places including Sri Lanka, Burma, Korea, Mindanao in the Philippines, Columbia, and Zimbabwe. Hartsough wants his peace force to march right down the middle path between doing nothing and bombing, so that places like Sri Lanka, now possibly on the precipice of peace, can be delivered there rather than disintegrate into further acts of death and destruction. ** Peace doesn't come cheap. Hartsough and his colleagues need to raise a pretty penny by peace-movement standards - $8 million a year - a sum that may be even harder to gather in the wake of Sept. 11. He is quick to point out, however, that this amount is equal to what the world spends on the military every four minutes. If they can secure the funding, they hope to have the force fully operational with 2,000 active members, 4,000 reservists by 2010. ** **Hartsough reasons, \"The United States has spent trillions of dollars on military security, bombers, planes, nuclear weapons, the CIA, FBI ... and that got us zero security. It didn't protect one person on September 11. Isn't it time to look at an alternative way to get security?\"** \"After Martin Luther King was killed, I was devastated, because he gave so much hope for a new kind of America with him as a leader.

Severely injured after a long fall while backpacking alone many miles deep in a remote wilderness area, she made a decision to live. Against all odds she not only survived, but developed a newfound appreciation for life. Her inspiring story below, as related in the *San Francisco Chronicle*, has inspired many to live life more fully in each precious moment.

It wasn't always that way, but crashing 60 feet into a granite ravine changed her perspective. A seasoned backpacker, [Racina] was on a solo trip two years ago in the Tehipite Valley, a seldom-visited area of Kings Canyon National Park, which is in the southern end of the Sierra Nevada. She was 12 days into a 162-mile trip when she lost the trail she was on. As she carefully crisscrossed down the valley looking for the trail, the ground suddenly gave way and she found herself careering through the air. **\"So this is how it ends,\" she thought in the seconds before she slammed into a granite ravine. ** **The fall nearly killed Racina, but the miracle -- the first of many -- was that it didn't. ** Racina has published a book recounting her rescue and arduous recovery. [*Angels in the Wilderness*](http://www.amazon.com/Angels-Wilderness-Woman%92s-Survival-Against/dp/0971088896/sr=8-1/qid=1160172386/ref=sr_1_1/104-3462640-4229555?tag=wanttinfo-20&ie=UTF8&s=books) ... is titled for the three hikers who saved her life after they came upon her even though she had been off-trail when she fell in a remote area visited only by a handful of people each season. Racina, 48, has been backpacking since she was 16. She frequently hikes in the Sierra, logging thousands of miles, many of them alone. She is a backpacker's backpacker, so obsessive about reducing the weight in her pack that she cuts the edges off maps. She is a single mom of a teenage son and runs two small businesses ... out of her home with a determined, no-nonsense personality. So after the fall, she calmly assessed the damage: Her legs were shattered -- one with an open wound exposing bone and tissue, and although she didn't yet know it, her left hip was fractured in two places; her face was badly bruised -- a front tooth", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:061007lifeanddeathencounter.txt:0:59a6ccbd48a8", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 7682, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "061007lifeanddeathencounter.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "061007lifeanddeathencounter", "chunk_index": 1, "text": "her pack that she cuts the edges off maps.

So after the fall, she calmly assessed the damage: Her legs were shattered -- one with an open wound exposing bone and tissue, and although she didn't yet know it, her left hip was fractured in two places; her face was badly bruised -- a front tooth had been chipped; and her hands and arms were bruised but not broken. In what she considered a stroke of luck, her pack had fallen next to her in the ravine. She used her limited first-aid supplies to clean and dress her wounds and a sarong she always carried to wrap her right knee, which was now a gaping wound. She set her mind to the task at hand: survival. She planned tasks she could accomplish: make soup, get water, keep warm. She even read a book she had brought, a historical novel about Aztec culture. **But Racina says her desire to stay alive kept her motivated. \"I had been ambivalent about life at times and been very depressed ... but now I knew I really wanted to live,\" she said. ** \"I knew that the chances of anyone coming to my rescue were very remote,\" she said. For three days and nights, she held despair at bay. Although she now believes she was in shock the entire time, she kept herself on a regimented schedule and spent most of her waning energy dragging her limp body a few hundred feet downstream toward where she thought was the nearest trail. The nearest trail head was some 20 miles away. Every now and then she called out -- against all odds that someone would pass by and hear her. On the fourth day, amazingly, someone did. **In another of what Racina calls \"miracles,\" Jake, a man with hearing loss who was hiking nearby with his wife and a friend, heard her calls. These three -- Jake Van Akkeren, his wife, Leslie Bartholic, and their friend Walter Keiser -- are the \"angels in the wilderness.\" ** It took awhile because she was so far from the trail, but Van Akkeren finally found her. Racina had not let herself feel the fear, despair and pain of her ordeal until that point. \"I couldn't afford to (feel) ... but when I saw Jake, I burst into tears for the first time,\" she said. The next morning, Keiser -- a former marathon runner with a heart condition -- ran 10 miles uphill out of the valley to get help. He came upon a group of campers -- firefighters from nearby Reedley (Fresno County) on vacation. When they heard his story, they bolted into action.

He came upon a group of campers -- firefighters from nearby Reedley (Fresno County) on vacation. When they heard his story, they bolted into action. One of them saddled a horse and raced off to his car, 10 miles away through the mountains, where he used his cell phone to alert the park service to the emergency. By the late afternoon, just before nightfall, Racina was airlifted out of the ravine by helicopter and flown to a hospital. **Doctors said if her rescue had come one day later she probably would have died from her injuries, or at the very least lost her right leg.** Despite her best efforts, she had lost blood, was dehydrated and fighting an infection. Yet rangers and medical personnel, while noting Racina's severe injuries, remarked on her demeanor: She was beaming. Racina was happy to be given another chance at life. \"This was one of the more amazing rescues because so many things fell into place to get her out that night,\" said Kings Canyon park ranger Debbie Brenchly, who was the first ranger to come to her rescue. \"When I first saw Amy, she had an amazing smile, and a great attitude, and that is so important in making sure they get out OK,\" Brenchly said. She said the park conducts 60 to 80 search-and-rescue missions a year. On average there are four deaths in Kings Canyon each year, according to park spokeswoman Alexandra Picavet. Many are from drownings, and alcohol is often a factor, she said. **Racina's rescue was only the beginning of her odyssey. She went through many operations -- seven on her mangled knee alone -- and spent three weeks in University Medical Center in Fresno. \"I have enough metal in me to set off metal detectors at most airports,\" she says gleefully. ** When she returned home to Sonoma County, she was in a wheelchair and still on IV fluids. Racina spent the next 10 months in a grueling physical therapy routine. Despite her doctors' prognosis -- that she might always walk with a limp -- Racina was determined to prove them wrong. And she did. Less than a year after her fall, she was back hiking in her beloved Sierra Nevada -- even solo hiking. Racina isn't swayed by the argument that it is too risky to hike alone. \"I don't consider it extreme risk. It's more dangerous to drive a car,\" she says. \"I love this kind of experience enough so that even if I had died ... I would consider my time well spent.\" Understandably, Racina often waxes philosophical about her second chance", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:061007lifeanddeathencounter.txt:2:225b350fcee3", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 7684, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "061007lifeanddeathencounter.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "061007lifeanddeathencounter", "chunk_index": 3, "text": "Less than a year after her fall, she was back hiking in her beloved Sierra Nevada -- even solo hiking.

For Racina, who had suffered depression and had had a rather dim view of humankind, the first lesson was that she wanted to live. That realization, she says, makes her happy to be alive every day. ** \"No day is as bad as one of those days in the ravine,\" she says with a laugh, adding that the \"small stuff\" just doesn't bother her anymore. Another lesson for her was that people would love her even if she wasn't strong and capable all the time. Her friends and family mobilized to support her during her protracted recovery: shepherding her around in cars, changing her IV and her bed pans, cooking her meals, and generally showering her with love. Complete strangers pitched in to help or contributed to a Web site a friend had set up for her (www.helpingamy.com), which was closed after Racina no longer needed help. \"No one was more surprised than me,\" she said of the outpouring of support. \"My relationship to humans has changed. ... I now think that people are good.\" **Racina says she believes her life was spared so she could tell her story. ** \"People who have read my book have told me, 'You had this experience so that I wouldn't have to.' I hope that other people can learn (these lessons) without slamming into rock!\" she says with a laugh. **Note:** Amy's book is rated five stars out of five on [amazon.com](http://www.amazon.com/Angels-Wilderness-Woman%92s-Survival-Against/dp/0971088896/sr=8-1/qid=1160172386/ref=sr_1_1/104-3462640-4229555?tag=wanttinfo-20&ie=UTF8&s=books).

What can allow us to be most effective in our life is a willingness to identify and transform our core life challenges. **Below is a short, powerful guide to personal transformation through identifying and working with core fears and life challenges.** By reminding ourselves that the most powerful change starts inside each one of us, we can develop more balance and strength in our work towards positive change out in the world. **Transform Fear Through Life Challenge Work** Most of us have one or more core issues or life challenges which surface repeatedly over the course of our lives. These issues are usually rooted in deep unexpressed fears. Depending on your perspective, core life challenges either cause all sorts of problems, or present many opportunities for transformation. **When you choose to look at core life challenges as an opportunity, you are much more likely to transform your fears into learning tools which lead to a better life.** Below are the most common life challenges, their related fears, and suggestions for dealing with them. **Examples of Common Core Life Challenges and Associated Fears** Abandonment - Nobody cares about me. I'm all alone. I don't matter. Arrogance - I'm better than all of you. I'm too much. I'm right and you're wrong. Damaged - Something is wrong with me. I'm a failure. I'm damaged. Inferiority - I'm not good enough. I'm stupid. I'm worthless. I'm boring. I'm hopeless. Rejection - I'm a burden. I'm unwanted. Nobody wants to spend time with me. Shame - I'm bad. I'm evil. I'm a mistake. I'm a monster. I'm disgusting. I'm possessed. Our these life challenges often originate from childhood family scenarios. They can be a result of negative messages that were repeated many times to us by our parents or other significant people in our lives. Or one of these beliefs may have been driven deep into us during one or more traumatic experiences. **Was one of the above statements drilled into you in your early years? ** Note that some people are overcompensators. If you are in this category, you may unconsciously do everything you can to make it appear as if you are anything but your core life challenge. For instance, someone with inferiority as a core life challenge might outwardly appear very macho or domineering. Yet deep inside, this is covering up a fear of being inferior. A person dealing with shame may be overly nice and giving to cover up a fear that they are really bad. Particularly if you are having trouble finding a core life challenge, notice if any of your behavior is opposite of the life challenges above. **Examples of Behavior of Overcompensators** Abandonment - Always need to be included, join everything to avoid deeper feelings. Arrogance - Act very humble, hiding their deeper", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:061119lifechallenges.txt:0:d8d9e82ca215", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 7686, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "061119lifechallenges.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "061119lifechallenges", "chunk_index": 1, "text": "this is covering up a fear of being inferior.

Arrogance - Act very humble, hiding their deeper belief that no one can match them. Damaged - Present themselves as always great, avoid talking about their problems. Inferiority - Macho, domineering, need to prove they are better than others. Rejection - Present themselves as incredibly desirable, yet reject others easily. Shame - Overly nice and giving. Overcompetency Secretly fear being exposed as fraud. Whether you are an overcompensator or not, **by exploring the deep, underlying fears of your core life challenges, you can transform your life for the better**. Though you may find that you have more than one core challenge, generally one will be more prominent than the others. Particularly if this is new to you, we highly recommend that you first focus on exploring your most prominent life challenge. To deal with this life challenge, you can design intentions to gradually shift this deeply ingrained fear. **Suggested Intentions for Transforming Fears, Core Life Challenges ** Abandonment - I am worthy of love. I can find ways to safely share myself with others. Arrogance - I can learn from all around me. I can see goodness in everyone I meet. Damaged - I am whole and complete just as I am. I can choose to love all of me. Inferiority - I am a good, valuable person. I can make meaningful contributions to the world. Rejection - I am an attractive, interesting person. People can enjoy getting to know me. Shame - I can be gentle with myself. I can hold the best intentions for all deep in my heart. **At the root of all of these core life challenges is a lack of acceptance and a deep feeling of being disconnected, whether it be from ourselves, from others, from our spiritual nature, or from any combination of these.** Here are two empowering intentions for dealing with these most basic core challenges: May I ever deepen my acceptance of myself and all around me. May I choose ever deeper connection with myself and all around me. The above intentions are merely suggestions which you may or may not choose to use. By developing your own statements that resonate more strongly with your personal experience, you can transform your fears on a deeper level. Set aside time to explore these challenges. Change the wording any time you find something more appropriate. You might also invite close friends or family members to give suggestions.

Change the wording any time you find something more appropriate. You might also invite close friends or family members to give suggestions. Writing down your intentions is highly recommended. Consider [writing a set of life intentions](https://www.WantToKnow.info/lifepurposeintentions), and review them frequently to help keep you on track. Once you have developed your intentions, cultivate an awareness of how and when your core life challenge is triggered. Notice when you are telling yourself that same old story. Each time this happens, remind yourself of your deeper intention and open to shifting from your old self-image into a new, fuller way of being. **You can continually choose transformation by remembering to recognize fear as an invitation to growth.** This is not to suggest that you avoid or suppress your fears and core life challenges. Working to accept and understand all parts of yourself, including your life challenges, opens the door to transformation and allows you more easily and naturally to access your beautiful deeper essence. This, in turn, can help you to live a much fuller and richer life. For overcompensators, who often have a strong tendency to avoid their fears, this is particularly important. For some empowering ideas on developing acceptance and understanding, [click here](https://www.weboflove.org/keystolife#acceptance). **Don't be surprised if after having a significant breakthrough in transforming a core life challenge, you eventually find the same challenge rearing its ugly head again in a different form.** Most people find that transforming fear through working with their life challenges is like peeling away layers of an onion. You make a significant breakthrough, only to eventually find the same challenge manifesting in another, more subtle form. Yet as each layer is peeled away, you will very likely find your life to be richer, more meaningful, and more enjoyable than it was before. By identifying and choosing to deal with our core life challenges, we transform our deepest fears and end up feeling more alive and more connected with ourselves and with those around us.

Future of Internet Debate Ignored by Media** (For full story, [click here](http://www.projectcensored.org/censored_2007/index.htm#1)) The Supreme Court ruled that giant cable companies aren't required to share their wires with other Internet service providers. The issue was misleadingly framed as an argument over regulation, when it's really a case of the Federal Communications Commission and Congress talking about giving cable and telephone companies the freedom to control supply and content - a decision that could have them playing favorites and forcing consumers to pay to get information and services that currently are free. **Source:** \"Web of Deceit: How Internet Freedom Got the Federal Ax, and Why Corporate News Censored the Story,\" Elliot D.

The story is particularly important because Vice President Dick Cheney, who now claims to want to stop Iran from getting nukes, was president of Halliburton in the mid-1990s, at which time he may have advocated business dealings with Iran, in violation of U.S. law. **Source:** \"Halliburton Secretly Doing Business", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:061222projectcensored2006.txt:0:4795b18340a7", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 7693, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "061222projectcensored2006.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "061222projectcensored2006", "chunk_index": 1, "text": "Halliburton, the notorious U.S. energy company, sold key nuclear-reactor components to a private Iranian oil company called Oriental Oil Kish as recently as 2005, using offshore subsidiaries to circumvent U.S. sanctions.

Researchers at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography and the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in 2005 found \"the first clear evidence that the world ocean is growing warmer,\" including the discovery \"that the top half-mile of the ocean has warmed dramatically in the past 40 years as the result of human-induced greenhouse gases.\" **Source:** \"The Fate of the Ocean,\" Julia Whitty, Mother Jones, March-April 2006.

Hunger and Homelessness Increasing in the United States** (For full story, [click here](http://www.projectcensored.org/censored_2007/index.htm#4)) As hunger and homelessness rise in the United States, the Bush administration plans to get rid of a data source that supports this embarrassing reality, a survey that's been used to improve state and federal programs for retired and low-income Americans. In 2003, the Bush Administration tried to whack the Bureau of Labor Statistics report on mass layoffs and in 2004 and 2005 attempted to drop the bureau's questions on the hiring and firing of women from its employment data. **Sources:** \"New Report Shows Increase in Urban Hunger, Homelessness,\" Brendan Coyne, New Standard, December 2005 ([Click here](http://newstandardnews.net/content/index.cfm/items/2691) for article); \"U.S. Plan to Eliminate Survey of Needy Families Draws Fire,\" Abid Aslam, OneWorld.net, March 2006.

High-tech Genocide in Congo** (For full story, [click here](http://www.projectcensored.org/censored_2007/index.htm#5)) If you believe the corporate media, then the ongoing genocide in the Democratic Republic of the Congo is all just a case of ugly tribal warfare. But that is a superficial, simplistic explanation that fails to connect this terrible suffering with the immense fortunes that stand to be made from manufacturing cell phones, laptop computers and other high-tech equipment. What's really at stake in this bloodbath is control of natural resources such as diamonds, tin, and copper, as well as cobalt - which is essential for the nuclear, chemical, aerospace, and defense industries - and coltan and niobium, which is most important for the high-tech industries. **Sources:** \"The World's Most Neglected Emergency: Phil Taylor talks to Keith Harmon Snow,\" The Taylor Report, March 28, 2005 ([Click here](http://www.taylor-report.com/audio/index.php?month=2005-03) for", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:061222projectcensored2006.txt:1:6aa4605398fc", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 7694, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "061222projectcensored2006.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "061222projectcensored2006", "chunk_index": 2, "text": "made from manufacturing cell phones, laptop computers and other high-tech equipment.

Federal Whistleblower Protection in Jeopardy** (For full story, [click here](http://www.projectcensored.org/censored_2007/index.htm#6)) Though record numbers of federal workers have been sounding the alarm on waste, fraud, and other financial abuse since George W. Bush became president, the agency charged with defending government whistleblowers has reportedly been throwing out hundreds of cases - and advancing almost none. Statistics released at the end of 2005 by Public Employees for Environmental Responsibility led to claims that special counsel Scott Bloch, who was appointed by Bush in 2004, is overseeing the systematic elimination of whistleblower rights. **Sources:** \"Whistleblowers Get No Help from Bush Administration,\" Public Employees for Environmental Responsibility (PEER) Web site, Dec. 5, 2005 ([Click here](http://www.peer.org/news/news_id.php?row_id=615) for article); \"Long-Delayed Investigation of Special Counsel Finally Begins,\" PEER Web site, Oct. 18, 2005 ([Click here](http://www.peer.org/news/news_id.php?row_id=600) for article); \"Back Door Rollback of Federal Whistleblower Protections,\" PEER Web site, Sept. 22, 2005 ([Click here](http://www.peer.org/news/news_id.php?row_id=591) for article). **7. US Operatives Torture Detainees to Death in Afghanistan and Iraq** (For full story, [click here](http://www.projectcensored.org/censored_2007/index.htm#7)) While reports of torture aren't new, the documents are evidence of using torture as a policy, raising a whole bunch of uncomfortable questions, such as: Who authorized such techniques? And why have the resulting deaths been covered up? Of the 44 death reports released under ACLU's FOIA request, 21 were homicides and eight appear to have been the result of these abusive torture techniques. **Sources:** \"U.S. Operatives Killed Detainees During Interrogations in Afghanistan and Iraq, \"American Civil Liberties Union Web site, Oct. 24, 2005 ([Click here](http://www.aclu.org/intlhumanrights/gen/21236prs20051024.html) for article); \"Tracing the Trail of Torture: Embedding Torture as Policy from Guantanamo to Iraq,\" Dahr Jamail, TomDispatch.com, March 5, 2006 ([Click here](http://www.tomdispatch.com/index.mhtml?pid=65894) for article). **8. Pentagon Exempt from Freedom of Information Act** (For full story, [click here](http://www.projectcensored.org/censored_2007/index.htm#8)) In 2005, the Department of Defense pushed for and was granted exemption from Freedom of Information Act requests, a crucial law that allows journalists and watchdogs access to federal documents. The ruling could hamper the efforts of groups like the ACLU, which relied on FOIA to uncover more than 30,000 documents on the US military's torture of detainees in Afghanistan Iraq, and Guantanamo Bay, including the Abu Ghraib torture scandal. **Sources:** \"Pentagon Seeks Greater Immunity from", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:061222projectcensored2006.txt:2:5aed159d207b", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 7695, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "061222projectcensored2006.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "061222projectcensored2006", "chunk_index": 3, "text": "full story, [click here](http://www.projectcensored.org/censored_2007/index.htm#8)) In 2005, the Department of Defense pushed for and was granted exemption from Freedom of Information Act requests, a crucial law that allows journalists and watchdogs access to federal documents.

World Bank Funds Israel-Palestine Wall** (For full story, [click here](http://www.projectcensored.org/censored_2007/index.htm#9)) In 2004, the International Court of Justice ruled that the wall Israel is building deep into Palestinian territory should be torn down. Instead, construction of this cement barrier, which annexes Israeli settlements and breaks the continuity of Palestinian territory, has accelerated. In the interim, the World Bank has come up with a framework for a Middle Eastern Free Trade Area, which would be financed by the World Bank and built on Palestinian land around the wall to encourage export-oriented economic development. But with Israel ineligible for World Bank loans, the plan seems to translate into Palestinians paying for the modernization of checkpoints around a wall that they've always opposed, a wall that will help lock in and exploit their labor. **Sources:** \"Cementing Israeli Apartheid: The Role of World Bank,\" Jamal Juma', Left Turn ([Click here](http://www.leftturn.org/Articles/Viewer.aspx?id=766&type=M) for article); \"U.S. Free Trade Agreements Split Arab Opinion,\" Linda Heard, Aljazeera, March 9, 2005 ([Click here](http://www.aljazeerah.info/Opinion%20editorials/2005%20Opinion%20Editorials/March/9o/US%20Free%20Trade%20Agreements%20Split%20Arab%20Opinion%20By%20Linda%20Heard.htm) for article). **10.

The American Chemical Council is now the EPA's leading research partner. The EPA is diverting funds from basic health and environmental research towards research that addresses regulatory concerns of corporate funders. **16) Ecuador and Mexico Defy USA on International Criminal Court** (For full story, [click here](http://www.projectcensored.org/censored_2007/index.htm#16)) Ecuador and Mexico have refused to sign bilateral immunity agreements (BIA) with the USA in ratification of the International Criminal Court (ICC) treaty. Despite the Bush administration's threat to withhold economic aid, both countries confirmed allegiance to the ICC, the international body established to try individuals accused of war crimes and crimes against humanity. **17) Iraq Invasion Promotes OPEC Agenda** (For full story, [click here](http://www.projectcensored.org/censored_2007/index.htm#17)) According to a report from journalist Greg Palast, the US invasion of Iraq was indeed about the oil. However, the US wasn't out to destroy OPEC, as claimed by neo-conservative writers, but to take part in it and increase US oil company profits. **18) Physicist Challenges Official 9/11 Story** (For full story, [click here](http://www.projectcensored.org/censored_2007/index.htm#18)) Research into the events of 9/11 by BrighamYoung University physics professor Steven E.

He asks her out to a movie; she accepts; they have a pretty good time. A few nights later he asks her out to dinner, and again they enjoy themselves. They continue to see each other regularly, and after a while neither one of them is seeing anybody else. And then, one evening when they're driving home, a thought occurs to Elaine, and, without really thinking, she says it aloud: \"Do you realize that, as of tonight, we've been seeing each other for exactly six months?\" And then there is silence in the car. To Elaine, it seems like a very loud silence. She thinks to herself: gee, I wonder if it bothers him that I said that. Maybe he's been feeling confined by our relationship; maybe he thinks I'm trying to push him into some kind of obligation that he doesn't want, or isn't sure of. And Roger is thinking: gosh. Six months? And Elaine is thinking: but, hey, I'm not so sure I want this kind of relationship, either. Sometimes I wish I had a little more space, so I'd have time to think about whether I really want us to keep going the way we are, moving steadily toward... I mean, where are we going? Are we just going to keep seeing each other at this level of intimacy? Are we heading toward marriage? Toward children? Toward a lifetime together? Am I ready for that level of commitment? Do I really even know this person? And Roger is thinking... so that means it was... let's see... February when we started going out, which was right after I had the car at the dealer's, which means... lemme check the odometer... Whoa! I am way over due for an oil change here! And Elaine is thinking: he's upset. I can see it on his face. Maybe I'm reading this completely wrong. Maybe he wants more from our relationship, more intimacy, more commitment; maybe he has sensed -- even before I sensed it -- that I was feeling some reservations. Yes, I bet that's it. That's why he's so reluctant to say anything about his own feelings. He's afraid of being rejected. And Roger is thinking: and I'm gonna have them look at the transmission again.

That's why he's so reluctant to say anything about his own feelings. He's afraid of being rejected. And Roger is thinking: and I'm gonna have them look at the transmission again. I don't care what those morons say, it's still not shifting right. And they better not try to blame it on the cold weather this time. What cold weather? It's 87 degrees out, and this thing is shifting like a darn garbage truck, and I paid those incompetent thieves $600. And Elaine is thinking: he's angry. And I don't blame him. I'd be angry, too. God, I feel so guilty, putting him through this, but I can't help the way I feel. I'm just not sure. And Roger is thinking: they'll probably say it's only a 90-day warranty. That's exactly what they're gonna say, the scumbags. And Elaine is thinking: maybe I'm just too idealistic, waiting for a knight to come riding up on his white horse, when I'm sitting right next to a perfectly good person, a person I enjoy being with, a person I truly do care about, a person who seems to truly care about me. A person who is in pain because of my self-centered, school girl romantic fantasy. And Roger is thinking: warranty? They want a warranty? I'll give them a warranty. I'll take their warranty and stick it right up... \"Roger,\" Elaine says aloud. \"What?\" says Roger, startled. \"Please don't torture yourself like this,\" she says, her eyes beginning to brim with tears. \"Maybe I should never have... Oh God, I feel so...\" (She breaks down, sobbing.) \"What?\" says Roger. \"I'm such a fool,\" Elaine sobs... \"I mean, I know there's no knight. I really know that. It's silly. There's no knight, and there's no horse.\" \"There's no horse?\" says Roger. \"You think I'm a fool, don't you?\" Elaine says. \"No!\" says Roger, glad to finally know the correct answer. \"It's just that... It's that I... I need some time,\" Elaine says. There is a 15-second pause while Roger, thinking as fast as he can, tries to come up with a safe response. Finally he comes up with one that he thinks might work. \"Yes,\" he says. Elaine, deeply moved, touches his hand. \"Oh, Roger, do you really feel that way?\" she says. \"What way?\" says Roger. \"That way about time,\" says Elaine. \"Oh,\" says Roger. \"Yes.\" Elaine turns to face him and gazes deeply into his eyes, causing him to become very nervous about what she might say next, especially if it involves a horse. At last she speaks. \"Thank you, Roger,\" she says.", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:070103differencesbetweenmenwomen.txt:1:f43f00c0d5d9", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 7701, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "070103differencesbetweenmenwomen.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "070103differencesbetweenmenwomen", "chunk_index": 2, "text": "comes up with one that he thinks might work. \"Yes,\" he says.

At last she speaks. \"Thank you, Roger,\" she says. \"Thank you,\" says Roger. Then he takes her home, and she lies on her bed, a conflicted, tortured soul, and weeps until dawn, whereas when Roger gets back to his place, he opens a bag of Doritos, turns on the TV, and immediately becomes deeply involved in a re-run of a tennis match between two Czechoslovakians he never heard of. A tiny voice in the far recesses of his mind tells him that something major was going on back there in the car, but he is pretty sure there is no way he would ever understand what, and so he figures it's better if he doesn't think about it. (This is also Roger's policy regarding [world hunger](https://www.WantToKnow.info/051023microcredit).) The next day Elaine will call her closest friend, or perhaps two of them, and they will talk about this situation for six straight hours. In painstaking detail, they will analyze everything she said and everything he said, going over it time and time again, exploring every word, expression, and gesture for nuances of meaning, considering every possible ramification. They will continue to discuss this subject, off and on, for weeks, maybe months, never reaching any definite conclusions, but never getting bored with it, either. Meanwhile, Roger, while playing racquetball one day with a mutual friend of his and Elaine's, will pause just before serving, frown, and say: \"Norm, did Elaine ever own a horse?\" **Note:** For a humorous photo showing the differences between men and women, [click here](https://www.WantToKnow.info/manwomandifferences).

Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. was born January 15, 1929 and assassinated at the young age of 39 on April 4, 1968. **I've Been To The Mountain Top By Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. ** *[Delivered April 3, 1968](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixfwGLxRJU8) in Memphis, Tennessee by Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. This was Dr. King's last speech before he was assassinated the following day. * Several years ago, I was in New York City autographing the first book that I had written. And while sitting there autographing books, a demented black woman came up. The only question I heard from her was, \"Are you Martin Luther King?\" And I was looking down writing, and I said yes. And the next minute I felt something beating on my chest. **Before I knew it I had been stabbed by this demented woman. I was rushed to Harlem Hospital.** It was a dark Saturday afternoon. And that blade had gone through, and the X-rays revealed that the tip of the blade was on the edge of my aorta, the main artery. And once that's punctured, you drown in your own blood - that's the end of you. It came out in the *New York Times* the next morning, that if I had sneezed, I would have died. Well, about four days later, they allowed me - after the operation, after my chest had been opened, and the blade had been taken out - to move around in the wheel chair in the hospital. They allowed me to read some of the mail that came in. And from all over the states, and the world, kind letters came in. I read a few, but one of them I will never forget. I had received one from the President and the Vice-President. I've forgotten what those telegrams said. I'd received a visit and a letter from the Governor of New York, but I've forgotten what the letter said. But there was another letter that came from a little girl, a young girl who was a student at the White Plains High School. And I looked", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:070114drmartinlutherkingjrquotesvideo.txt:2:c6a7dc9f44b4", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 7705, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "070114drmartinlutherkingjrquotesvideo.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "070114drmartinlutherkingjrquotesvideo", "chunk_index": 3, "text": "world, kind letters came in.

But there was another letter that came from a little girl, a young girl who was a student at the White Plains High School. And I looked at that letter, and I'll never forget it. It said simply, **\"Dear Dr. King: I am a ninth-grade student at the White Plains High School.\" She said, \"While it should not matter, I would like to mention that I am a white girl. I read in the paper of your misfortune, and of your suffering. And I read that if you had sneezed, you would have died. And I'm simply writing you to say that I'm so happy that you didn't sneeze.\" ** And I want to say tonight ... that I am happy that I didn't sneeze. Because if I had sneezed, I wouldn't have been around here in 1960, when students all over the South started [sitting-in at lunch counters](https://www.WantToKnow.info/060922nonviolentpeaceforce). And I knew that as they were sitting in, they were really standing up for the best in the American dream. [They were] taking the whole nation back to those great wells of democracy which were dug deep by the Founding Fathers in the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution. If I had sneezed, I wouldn't have been around in 1962, when Negroes in Albany, Georgia, decided to straighten their backs up. And whenever men and women straighten their backs up, they are going somewhere, because a man can't ride your back unless it is bent. If I had sneezed, I wouldn't have been here in 1963, when the black people of Birmingham, Alabama, aroused the conscience of this nation, and brought into being the Civil Rights Bill. If I had sneezed, I wouldn't have had a chance later that year, in August, to try to tell America about a dream that I had had. If I had sneezed, I wouldn't have been down in Selma, Alabama, been in Memphis to see the community rally around those brothers and sisters who are suffering. I'm so happy that I didn't sneeze. It really doesn't matter what happens now.

Below is an amazing, little-known excerpt from this Wikipedia entry describing a 1999 Memphis court trial involving a lawsuit by the King family questioning who was involved in the assassination of Dr. King. The U.S. media completely failed to cover this riveting trail and it's most astonishing outcome. \"In 1999, [Coretta Scott King](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coretta_Scott_King), King's widow (and a civil rights leader herself), along with the rest of King's family, won a wrongful death civil trial against [Loyd Jowers](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loyd_Jowers) and \"other unknown co-conspirators\". Jowers claimed to have received $100,000 to arrange King's assassination. The jury of six whites and six blacks found Jowers guilty and that \"governmental agencies were parties\" to the assassination plot. [William Pepper](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_F._Pepper) represented the King family in the trial.\" Mr. Pepper later wrote a highly revealing book, [*An Act of State*](http://www.amazon.com/Act-State-Execution-Martin-Luther/dp/1859846955/sr=1-1/qid=1168748135/ref=sr_1_1/102-1859328-2876949?tag=wanttinfo-20&ie=UTF8&s=books), detailing what the U.S. press refused to present. **The trial lasted four weeks and produced over", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:070114drmartinlutherkingjrquotesvideo.txt:4:2cc33e6d26a9", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 7707, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "070114drmartinlutherkingjrquotesvideo.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "070114drmartinlutherkingjrquotesvideo", "chunk_index": 5, "text": "a wrongful death civil trial against [Loyd Jowers](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loyd_Jowers) and \"other unknown co-conspirators\".

Those of us who've been developing inner peace all these years, time to let it all out. Time to affirm everyone's right to bear arms - provided those arms are used for hugging. Instead of giving in to \"fear gnomes\" - those little gnomes of gnawing fear that have been injected into the body politic - let's get right to the heart of the matter. Let's declare an emerge 'n see. Time to emerge from beliefs that no longer serve us and see how we humans have been [tricked into behaving foolishly](https://www.WantToKnow.info/brighterfuture). Time to emerge 'n see [beyond the dueling dualities](https://www.insightcourse.net/lessons/20a_beyond_duality) to find solutions bigger than the problem. Time to emerge n' see there's no escape. God has us surrounded. Might as well surrender. We are all part of the inescapable Oneness. One Spirit, many paths. One Planet, great diversity. One humanity, each of us totally unique ... just like everyone else. I have often said that if we keep doing what we've always done, we will only get what we've always gotten. It stands to reason that if we try doing something new, we increase our chances of getting different results. So while it makes no sense to take up arms against warfare, it makes all the sense in the world to lift up arms and embrace anything that nourishes peace. Now in this shrinking world that could definitely use a good shrink, it is understandable to look upward in hopes of the Messiah. But I say, we need to look at each other instead, and face the truth that we are looking the Messiah in the face. We have met the Savior and he is us! Here are all these children of God praying for Jesus to intervene, but we cannot expect to be fed intervenously forever.

The Creator created us to evolve in consciousness. Otherwise Jesus would have said, \"Now, don't do a thing until I return.\" I have a dream, so allow me to tell a vision. Each year at Passover, the Jewish people affirm the possibility of the Messiah: \"Next year in Jerusalem.\" Next year always comes, and the Messiah never seems to come with it. Maybe it's time to make a break with the past and actually act as if the Messiah is already here. You know, fake it till you make it. So put it on your calendars. Next year let's celebrate Past Over in Jerusalem, and declare that the past is over and a new day has begun. Hold this vision with me please: Leaders of the Christian, Jewish and Muslim faiths together in celebration - doing the Hokey Pokey. They put their whole selves in ... that is commitment. They pull their whole selves out ... that is detachment. They turn themselves around ... that is transformation.

And now the world wide web is being used as a platform for a wide range of conspiracy theories - more than 50 at the last count - which allege that the US government was somehow involved in the attacks on the World Trade Centre and the Pentagon. In the past, you needed the backing of a Hollywood studio or a major broadcaster to reach a global audience. Now, all you need is a bargain basement computer and a little technical know-how. Dylan Avery is a case in point. He's the 23-year-old documentary maker behind an internet phenomenon. When he was turned down by film school, he decided to make his own movie - and distribute it over the world wide web. **Loose Change has been viewed tens of millions of times and pulls no punches when it comes to saying who he believes is behind 9/11.** \"Our government will willingly kill its own citizens for whatever gain it deems necessary,\" he told The Conspiracy Files, \"and then lie as much as they need to cover it up.\" An accusation the US Government categorically denies.

Those who question the official account of 9/11 form a broad coalition. At the other extreme to Dylan Avery is Professor Jim Fetzer. **Scientific views** **Fetzer is a former US Marine officer and retired professor of philosophy. Puzzled by the apparent discrepancies in the official account of 9/11, he founded a coalition of like-minded academics called [Scholars For 9/11 Truth](http://www.scholarsfor911truth.org).** **Its purpose is to research exactly what happened that day, using the principles of scientific research.** \"Sometimes truth is stranger than fiction,\" says Professor Fetzer. \"As Sherlock Holmes was fond of observing, 'when you have eliminated the impossible whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth.'\" The members of Scholars for 9/11 Truth refuse to accept that the attacks were just down to Al Qaeda. \"The very idea,\" says Fetzer, \"that 19 Islamic fundamentalists could have hijacked these four commercial airliners, outfoxed the most sophisticated air defence system in the world, under control of a man in a cave in Afghanistan is only the most outrageous of the conspiracy theories.\" \"That has forced us in the direction of a deeper and darker complicity by officials of our own government.\" Conspiracy theorists are tapping in to a rich vein of cynicism across America. Alex Jones, a nationally syndicated radio talk show host, is a leading voice in the self-styled 9/11 Truth Movement. He believes 9/11 was \"an inside job.\" \"It's a self inflicted wound, it's a false-flag terror operation,\" he claims. \"We're going to expose the lies one by one, we're never going to stop and we will prevail, we will win, we will never surrender.\" **Fighting back** But the US Government is fighting back. President Bush has said: \"We must speak the truth about terror. Let us never tolerate outrageous conspiracy theories concerning the attacks of Sept 11th.\" And to try and fight the internet bloggers on their own territory, the US State Department has launched a website to debunk conspiracy theories - not just about 9/11 but a whole range of urban myths and inaccurate stories circulating on the internet. After the attacks, government officials were summoned to give evidence before a Congressional Inquiry set up to investigate the intelligence failure before 9/11. **Co-chairman Senator Bob Graham told The Conspiracy Files of his frustration at the lack of co-operation from the FBI in that inquiry, and by the government's decision to censor over 30 pages of his report which [related to Saudi Arabia](https://www.WantToKnow.info/9-11timeline60pg#saudigovt).** **\"Within", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:070307bbc911conspiracymovement.txt:1:1969c7233d19", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 7714, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "070307bbc911conspiracymovement.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "070307bbc911conspiracymovement", "chunk_index": 2, "text": "about 9/11 but a whole range of urban myths and inaccurate stories circulating on the internet.

The first clip from a Dutch documentary shows top Dutch demolitions expert [Danny Jowenko](http://web.archive.org/web/20070328190011/http://www.jowenko.nl/) viewing the collapse of World Trade Center 7 (WTC 7). He is not aware, however, that what he is watching is WTC 7 and that the date of the video clip is September 11, 2001. After viewing the video of the collapse, he states that he is certain that the building was demolished with explosives by a team of demolition experts. When Mr. Jowenko is then informed that the building collapse which he had just viewed was World Trade Center 7 filmed on 9/11, he is stunned. He is clearly confused and bewildered. Yet after recovering, he states that he is still certain that it was a planned demolition.** He can give no explanation and it makes no sense to him, yet he is certain WTC 7 was brought down with explosives by a team of experts.** To watch this revealing three-minute video clip, click below.

In this clip, the owner of building 7, Larry Silverstein, talks about the World Trade Center 7 collapse on 9/11, stating \"I remember getting a call from the fire department commander telling me that they were not sure they were going to able to contain the fire.\" Silverstein then relates his conversation with the fire commander: \"I said 'you know, we've had such terrible loss of life. Maybe the smartest thing to do is pull it.'\" Silverstein follows this with, \"and they made that decision to pull, and then we watched the building collapse.\" To see this clip: [**http://www.personalgrowthcourses.net/video/911/9-11_silvertein_world_trade_center_7**](http://www.personalgrowthcourses.net/video/911/9-11_silvertein_world_trade_center_7) ** WTC 7 owner Larry Silverstein in PBS Documentary *America Rebuilds ***** When later challenged about this, Mr. Silverstein has claimed that by \"pull it,\" he meant pull the firefighters from the building. But if that is true, why did he link the pulling of the building with watching it collapse?

Three simple, yet powerful principles presented here can lead to both self improvement and meaningful personal transformation. These pearls of wisdom have helped me many times to navigate the sometimes stormy waters of life and to move into ever-deeper, more meaningful connection with myself and with all around me. I invite you to open to divine guidance as you welcome in the deep wisdom and inspiration of these insightful words. With very best wishes for your self improvement, [Fred Burks](https://www.WantToKnow.info/aboutus#burks) for [PEERS](https://www.peerservice.org) and [WantToKnow.info](https://www.WantToKnow.info) [Former language interpreter](https://www.wanttoknow.info/g/fredburks/down_the_rabbit_hole) for Presidents Bush and Clinton **Principles for Self Improvement ** Profound self improvement is initiated by the realization that you are capable of direct access to the Divine. This is the realization that the wisdom of the Divine is discovered deep within you. There is a wide range of means that can facilitate self-mastery through meaningful self improvement. Though the means may vary, the intent behind the means is quite narrowly defined as the intent to expand into a state of integration whereby all aspects of your conscious self become increasingly aligned with your divine essence. There are three particular life principles that help to align your perspective with the perspective of divine essence and thus inspire meaningful self improvement. They are: 1) seeing the Divine in all; 2) nurturance of life; and 3) gratitude. When you apply these principles, a deeper meaning will be revealed to the seemingly random events of your life experience. This is the principle that the Divine is present and can be seen everywhere and in all manifestations of life. It is interwoven in all things like an intricate mosaic whose pieces adhere to the same wall, and are thus unified. However, it is not the picture that unifies the mosaic, but the wall upon which its pieces adhere. Similarly, the Divine paints a picture so diverse and seemingly unrelated that there appears to be no unification. Yet it is not the outward manifestations that unify. It is the inward center of divine energy that unifies all life. Seeing the Divine in all is the principle that all manifestations of life convey an expression of All That Is. It does not matter how far the unifying energy has been distorted; the Divine can be observed. It is the action of perceiving unification even when the outward manifestations appear random, distorted, or chaotic. The principle of seeing the Divine in all is the perception that life is perfect in its expression because it flows from perfection, and that no matter how divergent its manifestations are, all life is an extension of the Divine. In light of the obvious turmoil and destruction that are apparent on Earth,", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:070401selfimprovement.txt:0:dc0e3f62fe76", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 7719, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "070401selfimprovement.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "070401selfimprovement", "chunk_index": 1, "text": "unifying energy has been distorted; the Divine can be observed.

The principle of seeing the Divine in all is the perception that life is perfect in its expression because it flows from perfection, and that no matter how divergent its manifestations are, all life is an extension of the Divine. In light of the obvious turmoil and destruction that are apparent on Earth, this is an outlook or perception that may seem naive. How can life in all its forms and expressions be perceived as optimal or perfect? This is the great paradox of life, and it cannot be reconciled with your mental or emotional capabilities. It can only be understood in the context of the soul, which is deathless, timeless, limitless, and sovereign. **Calling forth the divine perceptions of the soul is actualized through looking for both the inward and outward manifestations of the Divine.** It is not only that the Divine is found within you and within every individual manifestation of life; it is also in itself the wholeness of all life. Thus, this principle of self improvement calls for seeing the Divine in all its diverse forms of manifestation, as well as in the wholeness of life itself. Life, in this definition, is an individual's sovereign reality. It is subjective and impressionable. Life is the wholeness of experience flowing past the individual's field of perception in the present moment. Nurturance of life is the principle whereby an individual is in alignment with the natural expansion of intelligence inherent within all life. This alignment enhances the life energy that flows past the individual with the clear intent of gentle support. **It is the action of opening to the highest motive in all people and in all life and supporting the flow of this highest intention towards its ultimate expression.** In so doing, the action is performed without judgment, analysis, or attachment to outcome. It involves simply nurturing the highest energy that flows from all people and all beings, and thus supporting their fullest expression of life. This is a departure from the normal perception that nurturing support can only be granted when others are in alignment with your personal will and desires. When, instead, you view everything in your life as an integrated energy flowing as an expression of ever-expanding divine intelligence, all life is honored as an extension of the Divine. All people and all forms of life can be nurtured and supported to their highest expression. Energy is an element of life that is so subtly interwoven with form that it is one, in much the same manner as space and time are inextricably linked in union. Life energy is always in a state of becoming. It is never static or regressive in its natural state. You are very", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:070401selfimprovement.txt:1:6a1c52a745da", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 7720, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "070401selfimprovement.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "070401selfimprovement", "chunk_index": 2, "text": "intelligence, all life is honored as an extension of the Divine. All people and all forms of life can be nurtured and supported to their highest expression. Energy is an element of life that is so subtly interwoven with form that it is one, in much the same manner as space and time are inextricably linked in union. Life energy is always in a state of becoming. It is never static or regressive in its natural state. You are very capable of nurturing this natural expansion of energy to forge new channels of expression and experience. There are many specific actions that can be taken to nurture life. Each soul can transform energy through a wide variety of means. Working through your body, your soul is able to collect and store energy and redirect its purpose or application. This transformation of energy can occur on both personal and universal levels of expression. That is, within an individual's field of awareness, energy can be transformed to conform to a vision of personal welfare, or aligned with a vision of universal welfare and goodwill, or a combination of these two. One of the best methods to transform energy is through exploring one's belief system. **All beliefs have energy systems that act like birthing chambers for the manifestation of beliefs.** Within these energy systems are currents that direct life experience. Your soul is aware of these currents either consciously or unconsciously and allows them to carry you into the realm of experience that exemplifies your core belief system. By cultivating beliefs that expand and transform energy, you are able to engage energy systems that are nurturing to life in all its myriad forms. When your beliefs are clearly defined as intentions, your life energy engages fully in the present moment. [Clarity of intention](https://www.weboflove.org/lifepurposeintentions) is essential to engaging the energy system of your core beliefs, and to allowing the nurturance of life to prevail in all activities. **Gratitude** If you are aware-or at least interested in having the awareness-of how perfectly the Divine supports your sovereign reality, there is a powerful and natural sense of gratitude that flows from you to the Divine. It is this wellspring of gratitude that opens the channel of support from the Divine to the individual and establishes a collaboration of purpose to transform the individual soul into a pure expression of divine essence. It is principally gratitude that opens you to connection and alignment with your divine essence. When you project gratitude, regardless of circumstance or condition, life becomes increasingly supportive. This feeling of gratitude coupled with the mental concept of appreciation is expressed like an invisible message in all directions and at all times. **Gratitude is an essential facet of love that opens you to redefine your purpose as a supportive extension of the Divine, rather than the whimsical outreach of fate or the exacting reaction of", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:070401selfimprovement.txt:2:911314e2bc2a", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 7721, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "070401selfimprovement.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "070401selfimprovement", "chunk_index": 3, "text": "opens you to connection and alignment with your divine essence.

When you are aligned with divine essence and live from this perspective as part of an ever-unfolding reality, you attract a natural state of harmony. This does not mean that your life is without problems or discomforts; rather it signifies a perception that there is an integral purpose in what life reveals. Natural harmony perceives that life experience is meaningful to the extent that you are aligned with your divine essence. When your personal reality flows in alignment with divine essence, you create lasting joy and inner peace. It is the perspective of divine essence that all life is pure love in its fullest expression, and that in this single concept, all life is conceived and forever exists. This becomes the core belief from which all other beliefs arise. And as these beliefs expand outward, this core belief system emerges with a clear intent of supporting a fundamental perspective of seeing, nurturing, and appreciating the universe as the divine cradle from which all life is created and evolves. **These life principles are merely symbols represented in words and served to you as a potential recipe to stir awake the embers of light that tirelessly burn within.** There are no specific techniques or rituals that are required to invoke their power. They are simply perspectives. In a real sense, they are intentions that attract experience that expands consciousness. They do not provide quick fixes or instant realizations. They are amplifiers of personal will and intention that clarify how one lives. Their profound transformative power is contained exclusively in the intent of their application. Through these principles of self improvement, you can become a master of empowering your deeper self. If you apply these life principles with clear intent, you have the tools to accelerate the emergence of divine essence. You can awaken the perspective, insights, and empowered abilities of your divine essence to create new realms of possibility and shape them as learning adventures that expand and transform your consciousness. This is the underlying purpose of these principles, and perhaps the best reason to explore them. **For a print version of these principles of self improvement, [click here](https://www.WantToKnow.info/transformation).

Thank you very much to the many supporters who called and emailed AOL and their political and media representatives. You have made a difference. We leave the message below for those who want to know all that happened. Together, we are making a big difference in the world! Dear friends, **AOL is now engaging in censorship by blocking all emails from non-AOL users which include the term \"WantToKnow.info.\"** To verify this, simply send an email to any friend who uses AOL for their email service and type WantToKnow.info anywhere in the message. The email will bounce back to you. Strangely, this only applies to non-AOL users. If AOL subscribers send emails with \"WantToKnow.info\" included, they go through. As a result of this, all of the almost 300 subscribers to our email list who use aol.com can no longer receive our information-packed newsletters. As you know, [WantToKnow.info](https://www.WantToKnow.info) specializes in providing reliable, verifiable information on major cover-ups of which few are aware. The website calls on all of us to join together in exposing corruption so that we might strengthen democracy and build a better world together. Apparently, someone at AOL does not like this. After checking with a number of our AOL subscribers, we have determined that the blocking went into effect shortly after we sent an email to our over 3,000 subscribers on March 24th revealing a major [banking cover-up](https://www.WantToKnow.info/financialbankingcoverup). **What gives AOL the right to block all emails sent by the general public which mention a particular website, as they did with WantToKnow.info?** I am convinced that blocking all emails which mention a designated website is not only unethical, it is illegal. AOL claims there were complaints of spam. Websites don't send out spam. Spam is generated through email. AOL certainly would be within its rights legally and ethically to block all email addresses from a website known to be generating spam, but only the emails. This has nothing to do with spam. I suspect the spam claim is being used as an excuse to disguise censorship. What's more, AOL doesn't even attempt to contact the website being blocked to give an opportunity for the suspected website to explain what is happening. It is even more egregious when -- as in the case of WantToKnow.info -- the website and associated emails lists have never engaged in practices which would be considered spamming. Our email lists use a double opt-in subscription process, and we include information on how to unsubscribe from our lists at both the top and bottom of every email sent. This is above and beyond what is required to avoid being labeled as spam. **AOL's practice of blocking any mention of websites", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:070406aolcensorsemaillist.txt:0:ac0a12feee11", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 7724, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "070406aolcensorsemaillist.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "070406aolcensorsemaillist", "chunk_index": 1, "text": "even more egregious when -- as in the case of WantToKnow.info -- the website and associated emails lists have never engaged in practices which would be considered spamming.

This is above and beyond what is required to avoid being labeled as spam. **AOL's practice of blocking any mention of websites in emails sent by the general public is clearly censorship. It is not only unethical, but I believe it could be shown to be illegal, as it prohibits the free flow of information in a democratic society.** This could easily be proven to be an infringement on the free speech rights of the public guaranteed under the first amendment of the U.S. Constitution. On what legal grounds did AOL have the right to block all emails from anyone in the public mentioning our website, WantToKnow.info? Many of us suspect that this is one of those shady areas through which certain individuals and groups with ulterior motives are able to exert censorship under the guise of stopping spam. We all know that there are many people and groups at all levels of industry and government who place their own interests above the interests of the public. Some of these could easily leverage their influence to cause public services like AOL to accuse someone they want to target of being a spammer, and with this excuse block any mention of their website in emails sent by the public. In fact, accusations of spam should be dealt with by blocking the spam emails and not blocking any mention of the website. This clearly amounts to deceptive use (blocking websites) of a legitimate function (blocking spam) and thus blocks free speech. **I invite you to join in a mass email campaign informing people of this infringement on our rights.

Thank you very much to the many supporters who called and emailed AOL and their political and media representatives. You have made a difference. We leave the message below for those who want to know all that happened. Together, we are making a big difference in the world! Dear friends, **AOL is now engaging in censorship by blocking emails from all non-AOL users which include the term \"want to know (dot) info\" (without the spaces).** If you add a www. in front of the above term and don't use spaces, it is the Internet address of a popular website which exposes major corruption and calls us to work together to strengthen democracy. As the manager of this website, I am avoiding using the website address directly here so that this message can get through to those who use AOL as their email service provider. To verify that this email blocking is indeed happening, simply send an email to any friend who uses AOL for their email service and type the above term anywhere in the message without the spaces. Don't forget to include the \".info\" immediately after the term. You will find that the email bounces back to you. Strangely, this only applies to non-AOL users. If AOL subscribers send emails with the website address in question included, they go through. In order to go to the website without triggering the AOL filter by including a direct link, we've set up bypass. To be redirected to our home page now, [click here](https://www.peerservice.org/redirectwtk). As a result this blocking, all of the almost 300 subscribers to our email list who use aol.com can no longer receive our information-packed newsletters.** After checking with a number of our AOL subscribers, we have determined that the blocking went into effect shortly after we sent an email**** revealing a major banking cover-up**** to our over 3,000 subscribers on March 24, 2007. ** Our website (which I won't mention throughout this message) specializes in providing reliable, verifiable information on major corruption and cover-ups of which few are aware. Apparently, someone at AOL does not like this.** What gives AOL the right to block all emails sent by the general public which mention a particular website?** I am convinced that blocking all emails which mention a designated website is not only unethical, it is illegal. AOL claims there were complaints of spam. Websites don't send out spam. Spam is generated through email. AOL certainly would be within its rights legally and ethically to block all email addresses from a website known to be generating spam, but only the emails.

AOL certainly would be within its rights legally and ethically to block all email addresses from a website known to be generating spam, but only the emails. This has nothing to do with spam. I suspect the spam claim is being used as an excuse to disguise censorship. What's more, AOL doesn't even attempt to contact the website being blocked to give an opportunity for the suspected website to explain what is happening. It is even more egregious when -- as in the case of Want To Know (dot) info -- the website and associated emails lists have never engaged in practices which would be considered spamming. Our email lists use a double opt-in subscription process, and we include information on how to unsubscribe from our lists at both the top and bottom of every email sent. This is above and beyond what is required to avoid being labeled as spam. **AOL's practice of blocking any mention of websites in emails sent by the general public is clearly censorship. It is not only unethical, but I believe it could be shown to be illegal, as it prohibits the free flow of information in a democratic society.** This could easily be proven to be an infringement on the free speech rights of the public guaranteed under the first amendment of the U.S. Constitution. On what legal grounds did AOL have the right to block all emails from anyone in the public mentioning our website? Many of us suspect that this is one of those shady areas through which certain individuals and groups with ulterior motives are able to exert censorship under the guise of stopping spam. We all know that there are many people and groups at all levels of industry and government who place their own interests above the interests of the public. Some of these could easily leverage their influence to cause public services like AOL to accuse someone they want to target of being a spammer, and with this excuse block any mention of their website in emails sent by the public. In fact, accusations of spam should be dealt with by blocking the spam emails and not blocking any mention of the website.

You have made a difference. **We leave the message below for those who want to know all that happened.** Together, we are making a big difference in the world! Dear friends, Thank you for the widespread response we've gotten to AOL's blocking of emails which include mention of our website Want To Know .info (without the spaces) anywhere in the email message. I will again avoid making any mention here of the website without the spaces to avoid triggering a block for our subscribers who use AOL as their email service. On links to the website in this message, we've placed an automatic forwarder on one of our other websites, so that the link functions without using the Internet address of Want To Know. Thanks to the much appreciated help of many of our subscribers, we have further refined what is happening at AOL. **We've also received many reports of AOL censorship of other political websites, a few of which are listed towards the end of this message.** I was mistaken in saying in a previous message that all emails mentioning our website and sent to AOL users are blocked. It appears that for some strange reason, those who use AOL as their email service are able to send emails using our website address. Yet all who do not use AOL are consistently blocked when they try to send an email to AOL users which include Want To Know .info anywhere in the message. Try it yourself to verify what we've found. I contacted AOL by phone to find out what is going on, and unlike many who shared their stories of problems with contacting AOL, a very friendly, competent man named Anthony helped to process the problem. Anthony checked his database and could find no block of our website address there. He could come up with no explanation for our problem. He did not doubt that we were having the problem, however, and wrote up a problem ticket to send to his superiors. He said we should hear back from someone within 48 hours and gave a ticket number and reference number for me to call back should we not receive a response. Shortly after the phone conversation with Anthony, I received an email from AOL providing our ticket number and describing how I could send further information on the issue. I wrote up and sent a detailed message asking how this blocking could have happened.

And there could be another explanation of which we are unaware. We will have to wait and see what AOL has to say. In the meantime, thanks for the tremendous support and many emails of concern we have received. Thanks also to the many people who posted messages on their websites, [called AOL](http://postmaster.info.aol.com/contact/), spread the news to their friends and colleagues, and [contacted their political and media representatives](https://www.peerservice.org/contactmediapoliticalrepresentatives).

Anthony in your support center was very helpful in dealing with our problem today when I called him at 4 PM. I just wanted to add a few comments in order to help resolve our issue. I am the executive director of a small nonprofit named PEERS ([https://www.peerservice.org](https://www.peerservice.org)), which manages several websites and email lists. We have over 4,000 subscribers to our email lists. The subscription process for all of our email lists is double opt-in, so that after subscribing, each new subscriber is sent an email and must confirm that they indeed want to subscribe before they are added to our subscriber database. This is to avoid any unintentional or unwanted subscriptions, and to avoid any accusations of spam. We also have instructions on how to unsubscribe from the list at both the top and bottom of every email we send out. Approximately 10% or 400 of our 4,000 subscribers use AOL for their email service. We send out emails to our main email list every four days on average. We never send out any emails to those who are not subscribed and never engage in any activity which would be considered spam. A short while ago, we discovered that our subscribers who used AOL for their email service stopped receiving our emails. After contacting about a dozen of these subscribers, all agreed that the last email they received from us was on 3/24/07. None of them received the next email we sent on 3/28/07, nor have they received any of the emails we have sent since. Thus it appears this problem began sometime between 3/24 and 3/28. After running a variety of tests with a number of our subscribers who use AOL, we discovered that though they, as AOL users, could send out email with the URL of one of our websites - WantToKnow.info - mentioned in the email, anyone who was not an AOL user who tried to send an email to an AOL user which included the term \"WantToKnow.info\" anywhere in the message found that their email was blocked and returned with a 554 error message. So it appears for some reason that a block or filter has been placed on the term WantToKnow.info for emails from non-AOL users to AOL users. I understand that if several AOL users were to make a complaint about our website, it might be blocked. I would like to recommend that before a block is placed on any website like this, you contact the website first to see if there might be a legitimate reason or resolution to the problem being mentioned by AOL users who have made a complaint. Otherwise, it appears that you are censoring that website. I cannot imagine any reason any AOL", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:070409aolblockingwebsites.txt:0:cf5c72db9dd4", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 7733, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "070409aolblockingwebsites.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "070409aolblockingwebsites", "chunk_index": 1, "text": "I understand that if several AOL users were to make a complaint about our website, it might be blocked.

Otherwise, it appears that you are censoring that website. I cannot imagine any reason any AOL users would complain about our work other than political, as our website does deal with political issues. We've received many emails of support from our AOL users for our work, so the vast majority very much support us. If they don't like our work, it is very easy to unsubscribe, as mentioned above. Because of what happened, I have to wonder if we are either being censored by AOL for our political work, or if a group of people who do not like our work have staged a complaint campaign with AOL to get us black listed. You could avoid accusations of censorship by communicating with any website before blocking it. After calling your support desk today, Anthony checked your system and could find no block of the WantToKnow.info URL. Yet we've had confirmation from over 40 people who are not AOL users that all emails they send to AOL users which mention WantToKnow.info in the text are returned unsent with a 554 error message. We would very much appreciate your help in resolving this matter and letting us know what we might do to avoid this problem in the future. Thanks much for you help, and please let us know if you need any further information.

Having received a total of over two million visits, the WantToKnow.info website with its 800+ webpages is now very easy to navigate with dropdown menus and submenus so that you or any visitor can quickly find engaging, reliable news articles, videos, summaries, and other key resources on any of the vital topics we cover. The informative WantToKnow.info email list currently has more than 3,600 subscribers from over 75 countries around the globe. We are now excited at the possibility of taking our vision to a new level. **One invaluable addition to the website we'd like to develop is a special section on analysis of each of the key topics we cover from a global perspective.** Using reliable, verifiable information and our pool of respected experts and insiders, this critical analysis section would provide incisive essays which take our current information several levels deeper by placing it within a greater context. As we have such an abundance of excellent information on a number of vital topics, we'd also like to start work on a series of new websites. Each of these would focus on providing in-depth information on one of the major cover-ups which we have helped to expose. Yet in order to make all this happen, we need your help. Until this February, though a number of key volunteers provided invaluable support, I was the only person working full-time on WantToKnow.info. Because of my deep belief that one person can make a big difference, I decided in early 2004 to greatly reduce my paid professional work, to forget about the need for a retirement nest-egg, and to dedicate all of my savings to bring the vision of WantToKnow.info and the other websites I founded into reality. I worked entirely as a volunteer as the driving force to develop the websites to their current form. Then just this February, eminent theologian [David Ray Griffin](https://www.WantToKnow.info/050504davidraygriffin) (who first learned of the 9/11 cover-up through WantToKnow.info) contacted me to suggest that when our newly formed nonprofit organization PEERS had the available budget, we consider hiring a very capable, well informed man named Tod Fletcher to join in this important work. **Even though PEERS had only received about $10,000 in donations in our first year (2006) - far from enough to pay anyone's salary - the all-volunteer leadership of PEERS and WantToKnow.info decided to take a risk and hire Tod as our first paid employee.** I committed to use my own dwindling savings to pay his salary if sufficient donations do", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:070510supporttransformation.txt:0:1d0c17211f41", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 7735, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "070510supporttransformation.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "070510supporttransformation", "chunk_index": 1, "text": "available budget, we consider hiring a very capable, well informed man named Tod Fletcher to join in this important work. **Even though PEERS had only received about $10,000 in donations in our first year (2006) - far from enough to pay anyone's salary - the all-volunteer leadership of PEERS and WantToKnow.info decided to take a risk and hire Tod as our first paid employee.** I committed to use my own dwindling savings to pay his salary if sufficient donations do not come in. Shortly after this decision, two wonderful supporters contributed a total of over $10,000, which will cover four months of Tod's salary. Tod and I have very much enjoyed working together in the past two months. We see incredible potential in further developing WantToKnow.info and creating new specialized websites. Tod is fully capable and excited about using his writing, analysis and many other talents to take our work to a new level. **We hope to be able to raise the needed money to cover Tod's future salary and even to hire a few more individuals to join us, so that we can more effectively help to build the critical mass we believe is necessary to turn this juggernaut around, and to create a world which works for all of us.** You can play a key role in helping us to reach our vision. We invite you to consider the value of what we are doing and ask yourself if you would like to contribute to this crucial work. Your contribution will help us to spread the word far and wide and to awaken an ever increasing number of citizens on the need to return to the basic principles of democracy, so that government of the people, by the people, and for the people shall not perish from the Earth. We are making a big difference, and with your support we can take it to the next level. Since January 2006, the WantToKnow.info website has been under the management of PEERS (Public Education and Empowerment Resource Service), a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization that I and some close colleagues formed to promote this work. This means that any donation you give PEERS by check, credit card, stock, or any other form, is tax deductible to the fullest extent permitted by law. Automatic [monthly contributions](https://www.WantToKnow.info/donationswtk#monthly) are particularly valuable as they enable us to have some certainty in our long-range planning. In addition to WantToKnow.info, PEERS maintains several other websites under my management to fulfill its mission of reducing social conflict and economic inequalities and inspiring global community based on love and cooperation. I personally am most excited to currently be developing a new website for all who feel called to be part of a planetary transformation team. This inspiring community action website should be ready for launch in a few months. For more on this, see [https://www.transformationteam.net](https://www.transformationteam.net).

One thing after another. **The downward spiral continued when a large pitcher of orange juice slid from my hands and smashed to the floor.** Glass and sticky juice spewed to the farthest corners of the kitchen, slithering down cabinets and appliances, puddling at my feet. Stunned, I looked at the mess. Then I dropped dejectedly down to the floor, my eyes filling with overdue tears. The tears came from begrudging and angry acceptance that \"today is just not my day.\" Bad day or not, errands had to be done. Filled with angst and negative mental baggage, I got in my car to drive into town. In the few minutes it took to travel to the bank I made a decision. I would be careful not to pass my bad day off to anyone else. I would be cordial and polite. And I would NOT retaliate when that harried driver pulled quickly and rudely in front of me causing me to slam on my breaks, dumping the contents of my drink onto the front car seat! **Standing in line at the bank, I was silently talking to myself. Actually, I was scolding myself. All of the events that had accumulated and contributed to my bad day were, in reality, so very minor and trivial.** I was over-reacting. I was indulging in self-pity. I tried to imagine the innumerable, individual lives that had been affected by 9/11, by war, by hurricanes, earthquakes, and other natural disasters. For the second time that day my eyes filled with tears as I realized how disconnected I felt from all those individuals who are trying to cope with truly traumatic events in their lives. They all seemed so distant and unknowable, and this justified and intensified my belief that I was being self-centered and selfish. I was sure that all my efforts to be a caring and loving person were for naught.

I was sure that all my efforts to be a caring and loving person were for naught. A voice broke through my mental distractions. Somehow I had mechanically finished my bank transaction and the teller was trying to get my attention. \"Young lady,\" she was saying, \"Young lady!\" I looked up and into the eyes of the bank teller, a silver-haired grandmother with a gentle beauty. Her keen eyes reflected concern as she leaned forward and softly said, \"I don't know what is happening inside of you, but please, believe me when I tell you that - everything will be okay.\" And then she did something quite marvelous. My hands were resting on the counter. She took her hands and placed them gently on top of mine. The touch was quick but electric. And in that moment my world shifted. **In the moment of her touch my self-doubt vanished. I found understanding and acceptance. I knew that love was being channeled through the heart of this beautiful woman directly into my heart.** I was infused with a profound awareness - that I am loved. I was speechless. I smiled. It was my first smile of the day. But it would not be my last, as from that moment on my entire day was transformed. Perhaps without even knowing it, the kind-hearted bank teller allowed herself to be a conduit of divine love. She was instrumental in transforming a day that seemed destined to be a day of tears into a day of smiles. The seemingly small gesture of a this gentle woman not only changed the course of my day, it became a powerful reminder in my life. The profound effect of that one simple, loving touch remains in my heart to this day. More people than not scoff at the idea of world peace. Laugh if you wish. As for myself, I believe it is possible to transform our world ... one act of loving kindness at a time. **Remember: A simple smile. A warm handshake. A kind word. A gentle hug. Through these, we open the transformative power of love.** **Note:** The above essay is taken from Annie's book, *[Love: My Search for Truth](http://www.amazon.com/Love-My-Search-Truth-Annie/dp/0533145546)*. **What Will Matter** By Michael Josephson Some day it will all come to an end.

There will be no more sunrises, no more minutes, hours or days. All the things you collected, whether treasured or forgotten, will pass to someone else. Your wealth, fame and temporal power will shrivel to irrelevance. It will not matter what you owned or what you were owed. Your grudges, resentments, frustrations and jealousies will finally disappear. So, too, your hopes, ambitions, plans and to-do lists will expire. The wins and losses that once seemed so important will fade away. It won't matter where you came from or what side of the tracks you lived on at the end. It won't matter whether you were beautiful or brilliant. Even your gender and skin color will be irrelevant. So what will matter? How will the value of your days be measured? What will matter is not what you bought, but what you built, Not what you got, but what you gave. What will matter is not your success, but your significance. What will matter is not what you learned, but what you taught. What will matter is every act of integrity, compassion, courage or sacrifice that enriched, empowered or encouraged others to emulate your example. What will matter is not your competence, but your character, Not how many people you knew, but how many will feel a lasting loss when you're gone. What will matter is not your memories, but the memories of those who loved you. What will matter is how long you will be remembered, by whom and for what. Living a life that matters doesn't happen by accident. It's not a matter of circumstance but of choice. Choose to live a life that matters. **Note:** Visit the author's website at [http://www.josephsoninstitute.org](http://www.josephsoninstitute.org) **Grandma Was a Shaolin Monk ** By Antonio Graceffo *I was a successful investment banker in New York City, but I quit my job to follow my dreams and live an adventure life in Asia.

The woman I was with refused to take me to the fair till I put some clothes on. I stomped my foot and shouted, \"But grandma, I don't want to put any clothes on.\" It was the feast day of Santo Antonio, my patron saint, which for me was like a second birthday that I looked forward to all year. My grandma took me by the hand, and walked me - after I had dressed, of course - what seemed a long, long way to the festival at Our Lady of Perpetual Suffering Church. Pink cotton candy melted on my tongue as I stood in a crowd of excited children, our noses pressed up against the fence, each waiting impatiently for our turn to ride the carousel. The carousel went round and round. Amid the flashes of red, white, and green, each of us secretly selected that horse, that perfect horse that we would mount when the time came. ** For me, the choice was easy. There was a tremendous white stallion which looked identical to the Lone Ranger's horse, Silver. The Lone Ranger was a major hero for me.** I lived with my grandmother because my mother had died when I was a baby. I always felt small and weak. But the Lone Ranger was big and strong. I had no control over who I was or where I went, which is another reason I idolized the Lone Ranger. He was so fiercely independent and could ride his horse anywhere he wanted any time. When the attendant raised the red velvet rope, it was like opening the starting gate at Belmont raceway. A throng of laughing, screaming children sprinted to the carousel, praying that they would get the horse they wanted. Unbelievably, no one had taken my horse. When I got close enough, I vaulted onto his back. Well actually, the attendant had to help me. In my child's imagination, the only thing that separated me from the Lone Ranger was my clothes and my lack of a horse. I believed that riding that horse, wearing my hat, pistols, and boots would change me into the Lone Ranger. \"Hi Yo, Silver!!!\" I screamed with excitement. There was a mirror at the side of the carousel. **As we came around, I fully expected to see a reflection of myself transformed into a magnificent Lone Ranger. But to my great disappointment, what I saw instead was the same small, weak boy I had been when I started.** By the third time we had gone around, I was forced fully back into my sad reality by the small image", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:070518inspirationalstories.txt:3:e799f9a017c6", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 7741, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "070518inspirationalstories.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "070518inspirationalstories", "chunk_index": 4, "text": "Lone Ranger. \"Hi Yo, Silver!!!\" I screamed with excitement.

But to my great disappointment, what I saw instead was the same small, weak boy I had been when I started.** By the third time we had gone around, I was forced fully back into my sad reality by the small image in the mirror. I threw my hat on the ground in despair. When the ride finished, my grandmother picked me up off of the horse. Seeing my profound disappointment, she encouraged me, \"Anthony, no matter where you go, or what you do, no matter how far you ride on any horse, you will always be you. You are wonderful, and I love you just the way you are.\" Then she smiled and added, \"but if it makes you happy to dream you're the Lone Ranger, then do it. Don't ever stop dreaming for the rest of your life.\" She put the hat back on my head, and I fell asleep in her arms on the subway ride home. When I woke up, I was thirty-four years old. I was a successful investment banker working on Wall Street. Money had become the guiding principle of my life. Most of my day was spent sending out letters or calling people on the phone and asking them to buy my products. **Mired in paper and consumed by visions of wealth, I had forgotten who I was. Yet I still had a picture of the Lone Ranger on the wall in my office. ** The feast of Santo Antonio had just passed and rather than celebrating, I had worked twelve hours that day. But on a quiet Tuesday morning just days later, the concussion of two planes crashing into the side of the World Trade Center woke me from my slumber. Ironically, it was like awakening from my life and falling into a horrific dream. When the buildings in Manhattan were evacuated, I joined the press of terrified humanity, wandering aimlessly through the silent and crowded streets. The air was full of a white powder, which I believed was anthrax or some other chemical or biological agent. Thinking I had been sentenced to death, I made my way to Saint Patrick's Cathedral. The pews were full, and the doors were jammed with people praying silently, tears streaming down their faces. I would later learn that the dust that clogged my nostrils, burned my lungs, and gummed up my eyes, was not some poison, but rather the charred remains of 3,000 innocent people who lived like me, concerned only with the rise and fall of the stock market.

For many, the single legacy they would leave behind was the money they had earned. Faced with death, money means nothing. We are all mortal, which by definition means we are all faced with possibility of death every minute of every day, whether we are aware of it or not. **Awakened from the slumber of what had been, I saw for the first time that money has no real meaning any moment of any day. ** I vowed to change my life, to become a different person. And so, I flew to Asia in search of another path. My first stop was Taiwan, where I soon settled in with my newfound Kung Fu team. They took me in and gave me a place to sleep. They fed me. They gave me clothing. They trained me. They taught me kung fu and culture. And most especially, they taught me about their religion. My teammates here weren't considered monks, yet as Kung Fu practitioners, they were deeply devoted to their practice of Buddhism. In the west, when we feel indebted to someone, we can assuage our guilt by paying them. But there was nothing I could give these avowed ascetics. When I tried to give them money, they refused to accept it. This confused me, because back in New York, I didn't know anyone who refused money. Later, after I learned to speak their language, I talked to them about it. \"Why do you always refuse when I try to give you money?\" I asked. Using my Chinese name, they said, \"An Dong Ni, money is a prison. The things we own wind up owning us.\" Over a period of months, as my understanding of the language, the culture and the religion grew, they explained further. The Buddhists believe that each time we die, we will be reincarnated at a higher or lower level, depending upon the balance of our good and bad deeds in our last life. Their ultimate goal is to reach the highest level, and they believe that the things we own will weigh us down and keep us from that highest goal. **They told me that if I took all of my money and possessions, wrapped my arms around them and jumped in a swimming pool, I would sink to the bottom and die. The only way to save myself would be to let go of those things.

The only way to save myself would be to let go of those things. Only then would I be free.** Money and possessions form golden chains, they said, which prevent the soul from soaring to the next level. The only way to get free is to cut those chains. I determined to cut all of the chains with my old life. The first chain I had already cut when I left my country. Next, I cut my money, my job, my language, and my culture. I lived like my Chinese brothers, and I learned to love them. The one chain I still maintained was my religion. I was still Catholic. And, as much as I loved studying with my friends, and even going to prayers with them, in my heart I just didn't feel that I could ever give up my religion. I sought advice from my Buddhist advisor on this, \"Gwo Su, you are the best person I know, serene, peaceful, kind, generous. I want to be like you. Should I become Buddhist?\" Gwo Su shook his head with a soft smile. \"Have you learned nothing from us? We weren't teaching you to become one of us. We were teaching you a lesson in tolerance. If I ask you to become like me, to take my religion, this is not tolerance.\" \"Tolerance,\" he said, \"is learning to accept people who are different. If you can learn to accept and love people who are different, if you can learn to see their differences as beautiful, then you have achieved tolerance.\" After two years with these spiritual warriors, Gwo Su's wise words helped me to realize that although I had been going through the motions, I had failed to learn this central lesson. **They had always given me the freedom to live as an American Catholic among Chinese Buddhists without ever asking me to change. This was a truly profound lesson. ** \"How could I have been so stupid?\" I asked. \"You Americans are so full of yourselves that it is nearly impossible for you to learn anything new,\" Gwo Su said flatly. \"If your glass is full of water, you cannot put something more tasty into it. **You must first empty your glass that it may be filled.

So a cruel king may be reborn as a beggar in order that he may learn humility. Thus if you are born as a man, a woman, a horse, disabled, rich, or poor, it is because these are the lessons that you need to learn through taking on these roles. These martial arts masters also believe that your race, your religion, and sometimes even your profession - the core aspects of who you are - are all carefully chosen, and you cannot change them. They feel that the way you are born is the way you should be. Yes, you can change your actions. You can change your behavior. But you cannot change the core of who you are. Through my extraordinary journey with these people, I learned that acceptance and tolerance both of myself and of those around me opens the door to incredible new possibilities. My next stop was Mainland China, where I lived with the monks in Shaolin Temple, the birth place of Chinese martial arts. None of us worked or went to school there. We spent all of our time learning Kung Fu and learning more lessons in Buddhism. After departing Shaolin, I took up residence in Hong Kong where I wrote a book called *The Monk from Brooklyn* - a daily account of my many fascinating experiences in the presence of these masters. I decided that I wanted to dedicate my life to adventure and to learning and studying. Through my writing and public speaking, I wanted to pass the valuable lessons I learned on to others. But to do that, I would need money. And the only way I could think of to get money was to sell my books and magazine articles. The next thing I knew, I found myself sitting in an office I had set up in Starbucks of all places, in Hong Kong. I had my computer and my cell phone, a Mocha Frapuccino and my Lone Ranger screen saver.

I spent all day sending email or calling people on the phone asking them to buy my books and magazine articles. One day, in the midst of a heavy negotiation with a publisher, I burst out laughing as it suddenly hit me. I had traveled half way around the world only to wind up back where I started! I was a salesman again, doing exactly what I had done on Wall Street. But the monks had taught me that this, too, was OK. I am a salesman, and that is who I am. **If I had just listened to my grandma all those years ago at the Feast of Santo Antonio, I could have saved myself a lot of miles and a lot of heartache. She had told me, \"Anthony, no matter where you go or what you do, no matter how far you ride on any horse, you will always be you. You are wonderful, and I love you just the way you are.\" ** Then she smiled and she said, \"but if it makes you happy to dream you are the Lone Ranger, then you do it.\" I guess my grandma would be happy because sometimes, if the work gets too monotonous, I step away from my desk, put on the cowboy hat, the boots, the two pistols, and nothing else. My grandma also told me, \"don't ever stop dreaming, for the rest of your life.\" Those words reminded me of stories the monks had told me. My grandmother somehow already knew the lessons that the Shaolin monks had taught me so well. Sometimes, I believe I will wake up from this crazy dream and discover that I really am just a little boy sleeping in her arms on the subway, dreaming that I am this man. And the monks would tell me, I am truly both. It is just another form of the same person. **The one lesson that I wish to give is this: You are who you are, and that is OK.** Whether you are a man or a woman, rich or poor, fat or skinny, old or young, you are fine just the way you are. It doesn't matter if you are Black, White, Asian, Latino, Hindu, Sikh, Jewish, Christian, Buddhist, Muslim, or whatever else. It is our differences that make us special. Celebrate your uniqueness!

They even proposed that the US military secretly blow up an American ship and hijack US planes as a false pretext for war.** For the entire shocking article: [http://abcnews.go.com/US/story?id=92662](http://abcnews.go.com/US/story?id=92662).

The only reason these plans weren't implemented is that they were rejected by the Kennedy administration. Had the administration approved, these secret manipulations would almost certainly have fooled the American public into supporting war. These plans for government-sponsored terrorism were classified top secret so that the American public would never know how it was being manipulated. They came to light only because of a Freedom of Information Act request in the late 1990s. Had the plans been used, they would have been given operational status, and thus would never have been released to the public in accordance with secrecy laws. **Below are key passages quoted directly from the Operation Northwoods documents, which you can verify at the above links.** Page numbers are listed to assist in finding the quotes in the original documents.

It is assumed that a single agency will be given the primary responsibility for developing military and para-military aspects of the basic plan. It is recommended that this responsibility for both overt and covert military operations be assigned the Joint Chiefs of Staff. **Page 5 of File** (page 2 of Joint Chiefs report) World opinion, and the United Nations forum should be favorably affected by developing the international image of the Cuban government as rash and irresponsible, and as an alarming and unpredictable threat to the peace of the Western Hemisphere. **Page 8 of File** (page 5 of Joint Chiefs report) This plan ... should be developed to focus all efforts on a specific ultimate objective which would provide adequate justification for US military intervention. Such a plan would enable a logical build-up of incidents to be combined with other seemingly unrelated events to camouflage the ultimate objective. **Page 10-11 of File** (page 7-8 of Joint Chiefs report) A series of well coordinated incidents will be planned to take place in and around Guantanamo to give genuine appearance of being done by hostile Cuban forces. (1) Start rumors (many). Use clandestine radio. (2) Land friendly Cubans in uniform \"over-the-fence\" to stage attack on base. (3) Capture Cuban (friendly) saboteurs inside the base. (4) Start riots near the base main gate (friendly Cubans). (5) Blow up ammunition inside the base: start fires. (6) Burn aircraft on air base (sabotage). (7) Lob mortar shells from outside of base into base. (8) Capture assault teams approaching from the sea or vicinity of Guantanamo City. (9) Capture militia group which storms base. (10) Sabotage ship in harbor; large fires - naphthalene. (11) Sink ship near harbor entrance. Conduct funerals for mock-victims. **We could blow up a US ship in Guantanamo Bay and blame Cuba.

Attacks on surface shipping and destruction of US military drone aircraft by MIG type planes would be useful as complementary actions. Reasonable copies of the MIG could be produced from US resources in about three months. **Page 13 of File** (page 10 of Joint Chiefs report) Hijacking attempts against civil air and surface craft should appear to continue as harassing measures condoned by the government of Cuba. **It is possible to create an incident which will demonstrate convincingly that a Cuban aircraft has attacked and shot down a chartered civil airliner enroute from the United States.** The destination would be chosen only to cause the flight plan to cross Cuba. The passengers could be a group of college students off on a holiday. An aircraft at Eglin AFB would be painted and numbered as an exact duplicate for a civil registered aircraft belonging to a CIA proprietary organization in the Miami area. At the designated time the duplicate would be substituted for the actual civil aircraft and would be loaded with selected passengers, all boarded under carefully prepared aliases. The actual aircraft would be converted to a drone. The drone aircraft and the actual aircraft will be scheduled to allow a rendezvous south of Florida. From the rendezvous point the passenger-carrying aircraft will descend to minimum altitude and go directly into an auxiliary field at Eglin AFB where arrangements will have been made to evacuate the passengers and return the aircraft to its original status. The drone aircraft meanwhile will continue to fly the filed flight plan. When over Cuba the drone will be transmitting on the international distress frequency a \"MAY DAY\" message stating he is under attack by Cuban MIG aircraft. The transmission will be interrupted by destruction of the aircraft which will be triggered by radio signal. **What We Can Do** **Remember that government and military leaders think of world politics like a chess game. Sometimes you have to sacrifice your own pieces in order to win the game.** Zbigniew Brzezinski, former U.S. National Security Advisor and co-founder of the Trilateral Commission, titled his 1997 book *The Grand Chessboard: American Primacy and Its Geostrategic Imperatives*.

Consider also that in September 2000, a think-tank named Project for the New American Century published a blueprint for maintaining global U.S. preeminence and shaping the international security order in line with U.S. interests. Written before the 2000 Presidential election, this revealing report was commissioned by future Vice President Cheney, Defense Secretary Rumsfeld, Deputy Defense Secretary Wolfowitz, and Governor Jeb Bush. The report shows that even before 9/11, the Bush administration intended to take military control of Persian Gulf oil whether or not Saddam Hussein was in power. [Article on BBC website and original report both [available here](https://www.WantToKnow.info/9-11cover-up10pg#pnac)] Considering the above information, is it beyond comprehension that tactics similar to Operation Northwoods might have been used in relation to the 9/11 attacks in order to create \"a truly massive and widely perceived direct external threat?\" **Could 9/11 have been the pretext upon which to build a War on Terror in order to \"maintain global US preeminence?\"** Might the 9/11 attacks have been allowed to happen, or even facilitated and manipulated by elements of the U.S. government and military?

More difficult than discovering the truth, however, is convincing most of the public to accept [it]. When it comes to 9/11, we face the strong belief that only al-Qaeda caused 9/11. But analyses by many experts reveal the collapse of the three WTC buildings was not caused by the two airplanes exploding into the twin towers. The general view is that the buildings were brought down by controlled demolition. It would have taken considerable effort by a number of people with expertise and access to the buildings to rig them so that they could be intentionally collapsed when the two jets hit. Tough questions flood in: Who could have engineered all this? Could foreign agents accomplish such complex actions - and if they did, why not take credit? If Americans did it, why would they intentionally inflict inevitable mass death and devastation? Worse, they seemingly knew about the plan to fly the jets into the towers. Post-9/11, why have the government and official investigations not come to the same controlled demolition conclusion? This makes sense if the government was involved. **Blog:** [http://dailyscare.com/blog/joel_hirschhorn](http://dailyscare.com/blog/joel_hirschhorn) A. K. Dewdney, PhD ** A. K.

The attack on the World Trade Center was a tragedy for the people in the towers and in the airplanes, and a tragedy for their families. It also marked the beginning of the tragic war on terror. The current trends in Western society towards greater surveillance and the loss of civil rights can also only be called tragic. If we have also been lied to, the tragedy is complete.

Steel could have only have melted (assuming no explosives were used) if it gained additional energy in falling. I shall show that this gravitational energy is insufficient to cause melting. Conclusions: Since there was molten steel in the wreckage of the World Trade Center, and since the temperatures of the fires were insufficient to melt steel, and since the gravitational energy was shown to be very much smaller than the energy needed to melt steel, the Twin Towers and 7 WTC could only have been brought down by explosives or cutter charges.\" [http://journalof911studies.com/volume/200704/ProfMorrone...](http://www.journalof911studies.com/volume/200704/ProfMorroneOnMeltingWTCsteel.pdf) **Member:** *[Scholars for 9/11 Truth and Justice](http://stj911.org/).* Association Statement: \"Scholars for 9/11 Truth and Justice is a non-partisan organization consisting of independent researchers and activists engaged in uncovering the true nature of the 9/11 attacks.\" **Mike Hawryluk, MAT** **No photo available ** ** Mike Hawryluk,", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:070618professorsquestion911.txt:12:c22c26c3519c", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 7765, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "070618professorsquestion911.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "070618professorsquestion911", "chunk_index": 13, "text": "the gravitational energy was shown to be very much smaller than the energy needed to melt steel, the Twin Towers and 7 WTC could only have been brought down by explosives or cutter charges.\" [http://journalof911studies.com/volume/200704/ProfMorrone...](http://www.journalof911studies.com/volume/200704/ProfMorroneOnMeltingWTCsteel.pdf) **Member:** *[Scholars for 9/11 Truth and Justice](http://stj911.org/).* Association Statement: \"Scholars for 9/11 Truth and Justice is a non-partisan organization consisting of independent researchers and activists engaged in uncovering the true nature of the 9/11 attacks.\" **Mike Hawryluk, MAT** **No photo available ** ** Mike Hawryluk, MAT** - Professor Emeritus of Physics and former Division Chairman, Suffolk County Community College, NY. **Statement to this website 3/30/07:** \"My wife and I, transfixed in front of a TV as the horror of 9/11 unfolded, watched as the topmost, undamaged floors of the WTC South Tower started to gradually lean (rotate) in the direction of the damage due to impact.

Careful scrutiny of video of the collapse of the South Tower (WTC2) shows the upper segment (above the airplane strike) listing, then dropping, then disintegrating or pulverizing. There was a massive explosion near ground level immediately before those events. The tilt-then-drop sequence shows the building's central structural steel core ... had by some agency been made insubstantial and unable to bear weight. Putting that together with the ground level blast and the subsequent pulverization it is clear very powerful explosives had to have been in play. The airplane strike was a mere smokescreen. Who planted the explosives? What kind of explosives were used? When were they planted? And for what reasons would someone destroy ... the Twin Towers? Simple logic requires of a credible account of the 9/11 events that it explain ALL details clearly shown in documentary footage, together with all other known facts.

Registered Professional Civil Engineer who worked on structural steel and concrete buildings in Boston, New York, and Philadelphia. **Essay *Vermont Guardian* 3/1/07:** \"Having worked on structural steel buildings as a civil engineer in the era when the Twin Towers were designed and constructed, I found some disturbing discrepancies and omissions concerning their collapse on 9/11. The interesting fact is that each of these 110-story Twin Towers fell upon itself in about ten seconds at nearly free-fall speed. This violates Newton's Law of Conservation of Momentum that would require that as the stationary inertia of each floor is overcome by being hit, the mass (weight) increases and the free-fall speed decreases. Even if Newton's Law is ignored, the prevailing theory would have us believe that each of the Twin Towers inexplicably collapsed upon itself crushing all 287 massive columns on each floor while maintaining a free-fall speed as if the 100,000, or more, tons of supporting structural-steel framework underneath didn't exist. Controlled demolition is so politically unthinkable that the media not only demeans the messenger but also ridicules and \"debunks\" the message rather than provide investigative reporting. Curiously, it took 441 days for the president's 9/11 Commission to start an \"investigation\" into a tragedy where more than 2,500 WTC lives were taken. The Commission's investigation also didn't include the possibility of controlled-demolition, nor did it include an investigation into the \"unusual and unprecedented\" manner in which WTC Building #7 collapsed.

It is difficult to overestimate the importance of this book in bringing to our attention facts that challenge any attempt of the administration to explain away its responsibility, or even complicity, in the events of 9/11. Whatever you now think of the Bush administration and its handling of 9/11, this book is must, essential reading because it presents in careful, scholarly manner facts that have to be dealt with in any further analysis of the 9/11 tragedy and its aftermath, the war on terrorism. ... In closing this review I want to make two comments. First is to commend Professor Griffin for an independent, careful and systematic examination of the evidence. Secondly, the conclusions of this book make it abundantly clear that we have the greatest problem in our history on our hands, far greater than the Nixon Watergate scandal.

He begins with a table of eight levels of complicity, from little to overwhelming and lets the reader decide where along the scale reality may lie. Two reminders of my Yale training jumped to mind: one was Leslie Weatherhead's distinction between the permissive and ordaining wills of God; some things God allows to happen; other things God directs to happen. (Application. Since it is overwhelmingly clear the Bushies knew such an attack was coming, did they--so overwhelmed with a passion to get into a war with Iraq--simply allow the events of 9/11 or actually conspire and were involved in various ways in their happening?) The other \"ancient artifact\" is Griffin's style of presentation. It reminded me deeply of St. Thomas' Summas, more Contra Gentiles than Theologica. Griffin methodically lays out the argument, gives you counter arguments and leads you to the profoundly disturbing conclusion that not only was there complicity, there was conspiracy.\" [http://www.amazon.com](http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A2D73RD2OMD47A/ref=cm_cr_auth/105-8009672-4038058?tag=wanttinfo-20) **Bio:** [http://www.race-democracy.org/ABOUT_BIOS.htm](http://www.race-democracy.org/ABOUT_BIOS.htm) John Rensenbrink, PhD ** John Rensenbrink, PhD** - Professor Emeritus and former Chair of the Department of Government, Bowdoin College.

Furthermore, if you have studied that investigation, you know there is no disputing that while investigators may have struggled with the identity of the paymaster, they were clear about one thing, he was Al Qaeda's finance chief. For this reason alone you have to ask why the 9/11 Commission Report never mentions the finance chief's role as the 9/11 paymaster.\" [http://www.vt911.org](http://www.vt911.org/McKinneyReport20050722transcript.pdf) Michael M.

Al Queda as an effective* international terrorist organization never existed* - nor has it even come into existence under conditions of maximum Western terrorist assault on a Muslim population. The idea of an 'international terrorist conspiracy' was completely fabricated by Washington and embellished by the empty bellicose rhetoric of Bin Laden, a leader without a following, a leader created by the mass media, a leader incapable of directing a single operative terrorist attack. If there is no evidence of the operative existence of Al Queda, and if Bin Laden has no effective following, it is clear there never was any terrorist conspiracy. The idea was fabricated by Washington to justify previous plans designed by Wolfowitz and Perle (1992, 1998) to conquer the Middle East. The fact that the 'worldwide terrorist conspiracy' is a clear fabrication, raises fundamental questions about *the event which triggered* the US drive for military conquest - 9/11.

Significantly, FEMA and NIST have failed to offer any plausible alternative explanation of this collapse. As to the questions of how, when, or by whom demolition charges may have been planted: there is evidence, though Cockburn may not be interested in exploring it, of activity on unoccupied floors of the Twin Towers just prior to 9/11 that is consistent with the placing of such charges.\" [http://www.911truth.org](http://www.911truth.org/article_for_printing.php?story=20061206104001101) **Member:**[Scholars for 9/11 Truth and Justice](http://stj911.org/) **Bio: **[http://www.mos.umu.se](http://www.mos.umu.se/seminarier/translation_may06/Michael_Keefer_cv.pdf) **Robert Scheer** ** Robert Scheer** - Director of the Privacy Project and Clinical Professor, Annenberg School for Communication, University of Southern California.

Last week, Bush conceded that there were indeed secret CIA prisons, when finally announcing that the group of \"key witnesses\" to the 9/11 disaster would be moved to Guantanamo and for once afforded visits from the Red Cross and minimal legal representation. Some of them have been interrogated in secret for up to five years, with the Bush Administration left as the sole interpreter of what they revealed. After five years of official deceit, it is not too difficult to believe that the isolation of those prisoners was done less for reasons of learning the truth about 9/11 and more in an effort to politically manage the narrative released to the public. There is glaring evidence that the latter was the case. The 9/11 Commission report contains a disclaimer box on page 146, in which it is stated that the report's account of what happened on 9/11 was in considerable measure based on what those key witnesses allegedly told interrogators, and that the commissioners were not allowed to meet the witnesses or their interrogators. \"We submitted questions for use in the interrogations, but had no control over whether, when or how questions of particular interest would be asked. Nor were we allowed to talk to the interrogators so that we could better judge the credibility of the detainees and clarify ambiguities in the reporting.\" In short, the most cited source that we have on what happened on 9/11, the much celebrated 9/11 Commission Report, was stage-managed by the Bush administration, just as it has controlled and distorted so much other information. In light of that sorry record of the propagandistic exploitation of the 9/11 tragedy for partisan political purpose, is it any wonder that large numbers of Americans have doubts about all of it and that a considerable industry of documentaries and investigative reports has sprung up with alternative theories ranging from the plausible to the absurd?

I've just spent an entire night and part of a day rereading and rereading [Professor Griffin](https://www.WantToKnow.info/050504davidraygriffin)'s thoroughly researched, judiciously argued, and incredibly disturbing book. Griffin takes on the task of investigating the official account of the 9/11 attacks, asking questions that beg to be asked,... analyzing possible scenarios, and asking what kinds of evidence would properly address unanswered questions. Griffin invites the reader to examine two possible explanations to account for the inconsistencies: the \"incompetence\" theory and the \"complicity\" theory. The former rests on the assumption that stupid mistakes were made both before and after the attack. The latter rests on the assumption that false official accounts were made about advance notice of the attacks and/or that after-the-fact obstruction of investigations took place. Griffin's conclusion is that it's reasonable to suppose that complicity rather than incompetence is the more likely explanation, and he painstakingly makes his case by examining five major challenges to the official version of what happened. On the second anniversary of 9/11, Donald Rumsfeld made the shocking public claim that the attacks were really blessings \"in disguise.\" Rumsfeld's point was that the US was motivated by the attacks to ramp up its military strength. But if even part of Griffin's analysis is on the money, the \"blessing,\" which has led to great subsequent loss of life and expenditures of monies in Afghanistan and Iraq, is built on a deception. A frightening, but not implausible, possibility.\" [http://www.amazon.com](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/customer-reviews/1566565529/ref=cm_rev_next/105-8009672-4038058?tag=wanttinfo-20&ie=UTF8&customer-reviews.sort%5Fby=-HelpfulVotes&n=283155&s=books&customer-reviews.start=11) **Bio:** [http://www.gettysburg.edu](http://www.gettysburg.edu/academics/philosophy/employee_detail.dot?empId=20001637) **John", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:070618professorsquestion911.txt:44:f460a6fd5e4a", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 7797, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "070618professorsquestion911.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "070618professorsquestion911", "chunk_index": 45, "text": "anniversary of 9/11, Donald Rumsfeld made the shocking public claim that the attacks were really blessings \"in disguise.\" Rumsfeld's point was that the US was motivated by the attacks to ramp up its military strength.

Griffin has performed an invaluable public service by writing this book, and at no small risk to his reputation. By exposing the flaws in the official version of these events he raises the possibility that mainstream journalists find too terrible to contemplate: that elements of the U.S. government, and possibly even the President, were complicit in bringing these events about. To those (and they are many) who would dismiss such a suggestion out of hand, I would recommend taking this book seriously. Griffin is no wild-eyed fanatic, and one could not accuse of him of making unwarranted logical leaps. He treats this topic with the same care and rational rigor exhibited in his philosophical works. This book is not so much an indictment of the Bush Administration as a call for a serious public investigation (and not a mere whitewash) of events that have been used to justify unprecedented infringements upon the civil liberties of Americans at home and imperial adventures abroad. Ultimately, such an investigation (were it ever to occur) would likely lead to impeachment. If the evidence points in the direction that Griffin's analysis suggests, the current government of the United States is guilty of the highest crimes imaginable. It is vital to our democracy that this book receive the widest possible readership, and that the public demand answers to these questions.\" [http://www.amazon.com](http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3HWLIDQCG5DNI/ref=cm_pdp_profile_reviews/105-8009672-4038058?tag=wanttinfo-20&ie=UTF8&sort%5Fby=MostRecentReview) **Bio:** [http://www.etown.edu](http://www.etown.edu/Directory.aspx?faculty=9f0f5bea-dd28-4ab6-911d-3374aea1734c) James Fetzer, PhD ** James Fetzer, PhD** - Distinguished McKnight University Professor Emeritus of Philosophy at the University of Minnesota.

The request was turned down, on the basis that, as [Griffin](https://www.WantToKnow.info/050504davidraygriffin) puts it, \"Almihdhar could not be tied to the Cole investigation without the inclusion of sensitive intelligence information.\" This led one frustrated FBI agent to write in an email that \"someday someone will die--and. . . the public will not understand why we were not more effective.\"... There are several other aspects about the FBI's behavior pre- and post-9/11 that scream out for further investigation.\" [http://www.count](http://www.counterpunch.org/sacks06262004.html) Four Arrows, aka Don Trent Jacobs, EdD, PhD ** Four Arrows, aka Don Trent Jacobs, EdD, PhD** - Professor of Educational Leadership, Fielding Graduate University.

Certainly, 9/11 was not an \"intelligence failure,\" as the government/media complex has characterized it. Rather, 9/11 was an elaborate hoax, a staged \"*war pretext incident*,\" engineered to fool the American people into accepting wars of aggression abroad as well as a rollback of their civil liberties. As such, 9/11 is a typical example of \"*state-sponsored, false-flag terrorism*\" and a *covert, \"black op*\" orchestrated by rogue elements within the U.S. government. It is \"*false-flag*\" because it was blamed on a political target group, the Muslims.\" MS Word doc at [http://erickarlstrom.com/Articles](http://erickarlstrom.com/Articles/9-11wasaninsidejobanda_.doc) **Website:** [http://erickarlstrom.com/index.html](http://erickarlstrom.com/index.html) 9/11 is unquestionably the most important event in American history since December 7, 1941, when Japanese forces attacked Pearl Harbor. The magnitude of its impact on America and the world cannot be overstated. The terrible acts of 9/11 and the events leading up to them deserve a thorough and unimpeachable investigation to learn the facts. And if some rogue elements within the U.S. government were complicit in the terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon on 9/11, as several of these individuals allege, it is critical that these elements be exposed and removed from power. **Note of acknowledgement:** Most of this excellent data was compiled by Alan Miller.

Please note that most of the individuals listed above are not affiliated with this website. **A PERSONAL NOTE ABOUT THIS WEBPAGE FROM ALAN MILLER ** I believed the official explanation of 9/11 for four and one-half years. I remember, during that time, becoming angry at news stories about people who challenged that explanation. However, in the Spring of 2006, I saw the documentary, *[Loose Change](https://www.WantToKnow.info/060407bestdocumentary9-11)*, on the Internet. Although not entirely objective, it raised many serious and disturbing questions about the events of 9/11 that I had previously simply accepted without much critical thought. And so I began a several month period of researching the events of 9/11. I found a great deal of material challenging the 9/11 Commission Report on web sites like [911truth.org](http://www.911truth.org), [physics911.net](http://www.physics911.net), [Scholars for 9/11 Truth](http://www.st911.org) and many others. I attended a lecture by [Prof. David Ray Griffin](https://www.WantToKnow.info/050504davidraygriffin). I learned much about what has become known as the 9/11 Truth Movement. Much of the information and limited media coverage of the 9/11 Truth Movement focuses on college professors like [David Ray Griffin](https://www.WantToKnow.info/050504davidraygriffin), [Steven Jones](http://st911.org/), [James Fetzer](http://www.d.umn.edu/~jfetzer/), [Kee Dewdney](http://physics911.net/missingwings.htm), and others.

In August of 2006, I began searching for statements about 9/11 by members of the intelligence services, military and government. Because of their experience in these areas, I felt their opinions about 9/11 would be an additional valuable source of information. I was surprised by the amount of criticism of 9/11 from this group that I found scattered around the Internet. I had learned of virtually none of this criticism through newspapers, television, or radio news sources. I don't know what really happened on 9/11. I greatly value these individuals' statements because most have spent large portions of their careers studying espionage, terrorism, and military operations throughout the world and personally planned and carried out United States' military and intelligence activities. They're experienced professionals, whom I trust. My objective, at this point, is to have our government launch a new, extremely thorough and impartial re-examination of the terrible acts of 9/11 and the events leading up to them. In my opinion, and in the opinion of the above listed experienced individuals, the current 9/11 Commission Report is seriously inadequate in explaining what really happened. **For the sake of those who died on 9/11, their families, the American people, and for the sake of peace in the world, please continue to seek the truth about 9/11.

Vitale has claimed that to the best of his knowledge, the story is true. But even if it is not 100% factual, the wisdom shared has helped many millions around the globe to step more fully into love and forgiveness. Materials are included after the story for you to explore further. **Simple Steps to Healing: Ho'oponopono I Love You, I'm Sorry, Please Forgive Me, Thank You ** **by Dr. Joe Vitale** Two years ago, I heard about a therapist in Hawaii who cured a complete ward of criminally insane patients - without ever seeing any of them. **The psychologist would study an inmate's chart and then look within himself to see how he created that person's illness.** As he improved himself, the patient improved. When I first heard this story, I thought it was an urban legend. How could anyone heal anyone else by healing himself? How could even the best self-improvement master cure the criminally insane? It didn't make any sense. It wasn't logical, so I dismissed the story. However, I heard it again a year later. I heard that the therapist had used a Hawaiian healing process called ho'oponopono. I had never heard of it, yet I couldn't let it leave my mind. If the story was at all true, I had to know more. I had always understood \"total responsibility\" to mean that I am responsible for what I think and do. Beyond that, it's out of my hands. I think that most people think of total responsibility that way. We're responsible for what we do, not what anyone else does. **The Hawaiian therapist who healed those mentally ill people would teach me an advanced new perspective about total responsibility. ** His name is Dr. Ihaleakala Hew Len. We probably spent an hour talking on our first phone call. I asked him to tell me the complete story of his work as a therapist. He explained that he worked at Hawaii State Hospital for four years. That ward where they kept the criminally insane was", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:070701imsorryiloveyoujoevitale.txt:0:3254c4258f7e", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 7810, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "070701imsorryiloveyoujoevitale.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "070701imsorryiloveyoujoevitale", "chunk_index": 1, "text": "do, not what anyone else does. **The Hawaiian therapist who healed those mentally ill people would teach me an advanced new perspective about total responsibility. ** His name is Dr. Ihaleakala Hew Len. We probably spent an hour talking on our first phone call. I asked him to tell me the complete story of his work as a therapist. He explained that he worked at Hawaii State Hospital for four years. That ward where they kept the criminally insane was dangerous. Psychologists quit on a monthly basis. The staff called in sick a lot or simply quit. People would walk through that ward with their backs against the wall, afraid of being attacked by patients. It was not a pleasant place to live, work, or visit. Dr. Len told me that he never saw patients. He agreed to have an office and to review their files. While he looked at those files, he would work on himself. As he worked on himself, patients began to heal. \"After a few months, patients that had to be shackled were being allowed to walk freely,\" he told me. \"Others who had to be heavily medicated were getting off their medications. And those who had no chance of ever being released were being freed.\" I was in awe. \"Not only that,\" he went on, \"but the staff began to enjoy coming to work. Absenteeism and turnover disappeared. We ended up with more staff than we needed because patients were being released, and all the staff was showing up to work.\" This is where I had to ask the million dollar question: \"What were you doing within yourself that caused those people to change?\" \"I was simply healing the part of me that created them,\" he said. I didn't understand. **Dr. Len explained that total responsibility for your life means that everything in your life - simply because it is in your life - is your responsibility. In a literal sense the entire world is your creation. ** Whew. This is tough to swallow. Being responsible for what I say or do is one thing. Being responsible for what everyone in my life says or does is quite another. Yet, the truth is this: if you take complete responsibility for your life, then everything you see, hear, taste, touch, or in any way experience is your responsibility because it is in your life. This means that terrorist activity, the president, the economy - anything you experience and don't like - is up for you to heal. They don't exist, in a manner of speaking, except as projections from inside you. The problem isn't with them, it's with you, and to change them, you have to change you. I know this is tough to grasp, let alone accept or actually live. Blame is far easier than total responsibility, but as I spoke with Dr. Len, I", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:070701imsorryiloveyoujoevitale.txt:1:dd1cb9b96831", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 7811, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "070701imsorryiloveyoujoevitale.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "070701imsorryiloveyoujoevitale", "chunk_index": 2, "text": "that terrorist activity, the president, the economy - anything you experience and don't like - is up for you to heal.

I know this is tough to grasp, let alone accept or actually live. Blame is far easier than total responsibility, but as I spoke with Dr. Len, I began to realize that healing for him and in ho'oponopono means loving yourself. If you want to improve your life, you have to heal your life. If you want to cure anyone - even a mentally ill criminal - you do it by healing you. **I asked Dr. Len how he went about healing himself. What was he doing, exactly, when he looked at those patients' files? ** **\"I just kept saying, 'I'm sorry' and 'I love you' over and over again,\" he explained. ** That's it? That's it. **Turns out that loving yourself is the greatest way to improve yourself. And as you improve yourself, you improve your world.** Let me give you a quick example of how this works: one day, someone sent me an email that upset me. In the past I would have handled it by working on my emotional hot buttons or by trying to reason with the person who sent the nasty message. This time, I decided to try Dr. Len's method. I kept silently saying, \"I'm sorry\" and \"I love you.\" I didn't say it to anyone in particular. I was simply evoking the spirit of love to heal within me what was creating the outer circumstance. Within an hour I got an e-mail from the same person. He apologized for his previous message. Keep in mind that I didn't take any outward action to get that apology. I didn't even write him back. Yet, by saying \"I love you,\" I somehow healed within me what was creating him. In short, Dr. Len says there is no out there. It would take a whole book to explain this advanced technique with the depth it deserves. **Suffice it to say that whenever you want to improve anything in your life, there's only one place to look: inside you. ** **And when you look, do it with love.** **Note:** This article on ho'oponopono is edited from the book *Zero Limits* by Dr. Joe Vitale and Dr. Len.

He states that we all share responsibility for everything we see in our world. By taking personal responsibility for our part and then healing the wounded places within ourselves, we can literally heal ourselves and our world. As related by Joe Vitale in the radio interview, **Dr. Len suggests a four-stage process for this ho'oponopono work.** Whenever a place for healing presents itself in your life, open to the place where the hurt resides within you. After identifying this place, with as much feeling as you can, say the below four statements: **I love you. ** ** I'm sorry. ** ** Please forgive me. ** ** Thank you.** For a brief history on the develpment of this modern version of ho'oponopono, read about this and the ancient practice in Hawaii that was the basis for this method on [this Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ho%CA%BBoponopono). For several inspiring articles on the ho'oponopono process, see the [ho'oponopono website](http://www.self-i-dentity-through-hooponopono.com/articles).
