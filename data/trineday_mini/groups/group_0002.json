After conquering large swaths of territory in Syria and Iraq, ISIS proclaimed itself the Caliphate in 2014 and began accepting affiliates in numerous countries across the Islamic world from West Africa to the Philippines. The onslaught of ISIS was already under way during Obama’s first term, but most of its territorial gains came during the second. After long resisting military involvement against ISIS, the American president eventually began hesitant, perfunctory use of air power in Syria and extended military aid to the Iraqi government to fight the radical movement. Coordinating with Iran, Russia then moved ground troops and planes into Syria in September of 2015 to support the Assad regime while expanding its naval base in Tartus. Its targets were overwhelmingly the United States’ Sunni allies among the Syrian rebels. The administration began working with some effectiveness in 2016 with Kurdish militias friendly to the West, who began taking territory from ISIS in Iraq and Syria. On multiple fronts, the Obama administration balked at assuming leadership and largely left the allies to fend for themselves. Although the administration moved some forces to Eastern Europe, it for the most part ceded support of Ukraine to the European allies, who participated in economic sanctions, organized financial support for the country, and sent a few troops to neighboring countries but, like the United States, were unwilling to help arm it to better resist the invasion. Japan and other Asian allies largely had to deal with Chinese aggression by themselves although the United States did send ships through and planes over the South China Sea in sporadic defiance of and protest against China’s unilateral advances and proclamations. The administration opposed the Iran-supported Houthi takeover of Yemen but passed on much of the task of dealing with it to the Arab League with Saudi Arabia, Egypt, and Jordan taking the lead. Obama disengaged from the Pax Americana in part because unlike his predecessors he substantially took the security of the United States and its allies for granted.26 He also disengaged from it because, even more unlike his predecessors, he did not consider these countries beacons. He identified not with them but with putatively disadvantaged outsiders, a broad social disaffection he shared with many of his contemporaries. Obama’s concerns were withdrawing troops from Iraq and Afghanistan, endorsing unconditional Palestinian statehood, releasing prisoners from Guantanamo, normalizing relations with Cuba, fighting ebola in Africa, giving amnesty to illegal immigrants, and allowing large numbers of unscreened Syrian refugees into the country. The approach of international disorder during Obama’s second administration initiated a new phase of the Pax Americana in which the security regime was under sustained challenge and for the first time precarious.

The approach of international disorder during Obama’s second administration initiated a new phase of the Pax Americana in which the security regime was under sustained challenge and for the first time precarious. The precarious Pax Americana since 2013 has been analogous to the late Pax Britannica from 1871-1914, the period following the Franco-Prussian war and unification of Germany. Once an authoritarian, nationalistic, rapidly industrializing, and broadly developing Germany was unified under a martial Prussia that was filled with hubris from three successful wars, culminating in the quick, lopsided defeat of France – Britain had to wage an increasingly uphill struggle to maintain the international security regime, one that eventually failed. However, the precarious Pax Americana under Obama was different from the late Pax Britannica in that this time around, unlike the last, the potential power was overwhelmingly present in the liberal societies with which to support the security regime. Much of the grand drama of the modern world continued to be the opposition between liberal and authoritarian societies during the global era. Its major hierarchical regimes were all fundamentally predatory – they aggressed daily against their own people, and only military deterrence kept them from aggressing against other countries. The Pax Americana was built upon the terrible lessons learned during and after the 31-year crisis regarding what happens when liberal societies appease authoritarian societies’ demands or stand aside when they conquer. Most Americans understand that the United States is the indispensable nation without whose leadership the peaceful, tolerant, prosperous world we have known since 1945 disintegrates, and they have an understandable dread regarding how bad the consequences might be were that to occur. They also sense that the United States needs its friends and allies just as they need it. The ultimate flywheel of the Pax Americana had long been that the advanced liberal societies making up the core of the world community possessed tremendous resources, basic unity, capable citizens, dedicated leaders, widespread responsibility, and great potential power when the need arose. Contemporary hierarchical regimes, by contrast, were brittle, one and all. If their aggression were deterred for long enough, they would eventually accumulate unsustainable levels of corruption and discontent and crumble internally. Deterring authoritarian societies from international aggression required sustained alertness and resolve on the part of the United States and its allies, a prolonged arm-wrestle. As we shall see, the further weakening of the Pax Americana that occurred between 2013 and 2016 had to do with the increased economic might of China but more to do with sociocultural changes in the West.

China now had substantial resources, but the massive economic resources of the United States remained in place, and those of Europe, although diminished, also remained enormous. Nevertheless, important sources of U.S. and allied strength were eroding through the global era while some of those of authoritarian societies were building. Among the new sources of American weakness were precipitous declines in unity, leadership, engagement, and responsibility. Tendencies to narrowness, historical obliviousness, and naïve idealism have long been vulnerabilities of liberal societies needing to be overcome, but wisdom and leadership were becoming scarce by the end of the global era, leaving these societies exposed. As government became less dependable, it could be less readily entrusted with tasks, including that of maintaining international security. China and Russia underwent turbulent paradigm conflict respectively during the late 1960s and 1970s and the late 1980s and 1990s, and by the mid-2010s it was the West’s turn again. The problem was that the upper classes of liberal societies were withdrawing their sense of responsibility and needed leadership, as if playing chicken with reality. While the Chinese were investing immense sums, the Russians were maintaining their formidable nuclear presence, and both were upgrading their military technology, liberal societies were dropping their defense spending and readiness to dangerous levels. John Gaddis aptly speaks of “a disconnection in our thinking between the security to which we have become accustomed and the means by which we obtained it.”27 Leon Trotsky said it best: “You may not be interested in war, but war is interested in you!”28 As we shall also see, the nature of international security regimes determines a great deal about the societies under them. The geopolitics of the global era at the same time gains the fuller context it requires when we examine the profound ways in which society and character changed during its 51 years. The Pax Americana was foundational to the society and time, and so was the global capitalism that arose out of it, to which we now turn. As the United States and the United Kingdom were nearing theend of World War II, the global economy was high on their list of priorities. Having watched the world fall into depression amid mercantilist, competitive currency devaluations and tariff increases, they had learned well the bitter lessons of harsh international monetary and trade practices.

They resolved to do better and began putting in place the architecture of a global capitalism that would not become fully ascendant until decades later. In 1944 the United States hosted the Bretton Woods conference at which, with major British input, the bedrock principles and institutions of postwar global free trade were established. The international monetary system issuing from it was based upon a limited gold standard that provided at once for capital controls and for adjustments between currency values. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) was created to monitor national policies and currency values and extend loans to assist countries whose currencies were in jeopardy.29 The monetary aspects of Bretton Woods endured until 1971 when reconciling countries’ divergent monetary and fiscal policies within a quasi-fixed-rate system became unduly cumbersome. A system of floating rates has been in place ever since for the currencies of most countries, although a few have pegged the value of their currencies to that of another nation as, for example, Hong Kong has done with its currency to the U.S. dollar. After the war the United States and United Kingdom established relatively low tariffs, and in 1947, together with many other countries, set up the current international free trade regime under the General Agreement on Trade and Tariffs (GATT). GATT and its successor, the World Trade Organization (WTO), provided a loose framework within which member nations were encouraged to progressively liberalize trade policies. The infamous Smoot-Hawley Tariff that took effect in 1930 had been 46 percent, which was not unusual for the time. By the early 1980s, average U.S., EU, and Japanese tariffs were reduced to 4.9 percent, 6.0 percent, and 5.4 percent respectively, and by 2009 to 4.3 percent, 3.6 percent, and 3.1 percent.30 In addition to those brokered through the WTO, a number of important regional multilateral trade agreements were reached among global capitalist countries to facilitate international exchange. They included NAFTA (the North American Free Trade Agreement), joining the United States, Canada, and Mexico in even less restrictive trade in 1994. Yet the most important condition of global capitalism was the simple presence of the Pax Americana’s light international order, leaving room for peaceful international trade that created its own momentum. lobal capitalism was the economic facet of global liberalism.

Some of the characteristic features of global capitalism did not emerge until the 1970s and early 1980s. Market economies were no longer easily able to sustain barriers to restrict competition and protect national economic interests. Monopolies and cartels in such forms as industrial organizations, trade associations, fair trade agreements, and labor unions had been encouraged during the national era. Many national-era restraints of trade were either swept away or significantly weakened under the vigorous economic competition of the global era, although new ones also arose, including OPEC. After centuries of inaction in response to the stupendous development of the modern West, the third world became predominantly capitalist during the global era. Most third-world countries substantially cut back hierarchies,31 privatized former state enterprises, and opened their economic markets. Supply and demand drew and squeezed well over a billion former peasants off the land and into cities and towns for paying jobs. Among non-Western societies, only Japan had liberalized and achieved sustained economic growth prior to the global era, under special circumstances during the 1950s. Virtually all other third-world countries remained traditionally hierarchical until the global period. Japan’s postwar recovery complete, it surged to world leadership in many industries during the 1960s and 1970s. Then, early in the global era, the “four tigers” – Hong Kong, Singapore, Taiwan, and South Korea – underwent extensive economic liberalization and achieved sustained growth. From 1965, Singapore under Lee Kwan Yew and his son Lee Hsien Loong pursued free-market policies coupled with mild, benign authoritarian rule, carried out with genius by the elder Lee. Capitalism broke out of its earlier Western confines and became widely accepted, as a global agora of scores of new and prospering market societies came into being amid economic freedom and unparalleled international trade. Most of Latin America became capitalist during the late 1970s and 1980s, Chile spectacularly so. That country had enjoyed a precociously democratic history earlier in the 20^(th) century but had been dependent upon the export of a few basic commodities, subject to strong price swings. Like numerous other less developed societies of the time, it was also burdened with a costly, inefficient bureaucracy and dysfunctional welfare state. Following the capable and well-intentioned but misguidedly statist leadership of Eduardo Frei, Chile underwent the wrenching turmoil of Salvador Allende’s communist expropriations followed by General Augusto Pinochet’s brutal repression.

Despite the appalling severity with which the latter dealt with the radical opposition, Pinochet undertook thoroughgoing economic reforms based upon Milton Friedman’s pro-free-market ideas as implemented by a talented group of University of Chicago-trained economists. Pinochet stabilized the money supply, pruned and restructured social programs, and deregulated the economy. His brilliant, startlingly successful privatization of Chile’s social security system was influential worldwide. From the 1970s, Chile enjoyed the strong, sustained, and diversified economic growth that had previously eluded it, becoming an early third-world exemplar of the advantages of working with the markets, not against them. Mexico first took the opposite turn from Chile’s in the global era as President Lopez Portillo hurriedly undertook massive nationalization of the banking system toward the end of his term in 1982. His country liberalized belatedly from the early 1990s under Salinas de Gotari and several successors. Peña Nieto, although from the long-retrograde PRI, attempted to strike against entrenched special interests beginning in 2012, but his country was only able to grow at a disappointing 2 percent rate.32 Brazil, a star during the 1990s and first decade of this century, settled back to a 1 to 2 percent growth rate and then sank into deep recession in 2015 from which it did not emerge until 2017.33 India’s Nehru set a mid-century economic course of top-down planning, high subsidies, intrusive controls, and socialist leaning. He bequeathed a legacy of mixed traditional hierarchical and British-elite disdain for economic markets, sapping India’s economy for decades, but he did create the elite institutes of technology that were important to its later ascent. Prime Minister P. V. Rao and Economics Minister Manmohan Singh of the Congress Party at last began deregulating the cumbersome economy and opening it to the markets in 1991. The sustained economic development which began that year leveraged the skills, energy, and capital of large, well-educated émigré communities to establish centers of entrepreneurialism in Bangalore and Mumbai. Their software and business services industries soon became global presences. Fluent knowledge of English by much of the country’s middle class helped facilitate India’s economic development. An air of satrapy hung about the Indian civil service and judiciary, both of which were granted extensive legal immunity, leaving officialdom unaccountable.34 The government was supposed to provide free electricity and water but performed these services poorly when at all, yet private utilities were barred from charging for services.

Defense procurement and agricultural regulation were corrupt.35 India protected its small retail sector by discouraging international chains (until late 2015), slowing growth but augmenting social stability. India’s informal economy remained vastly larger than its formal one, in part because being in it enabled employers to escape draconian labor laws. India was burdened as well by an extremely complex tax system.36 Several Asian countries, including Hong Kong, Singapore, Taiwan, and South Korea, reached or exceeded first-world economic levels during the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s, quickly matching the earlier economic miracles of Germany and Japan. South Korea’s economy grew at an 8.3 percent rate from 1965 to 1980.37 By 2010 Singapore had become one of the most prosperous countries in the world per capita. India began sustained GDP growth that ranged between approximately 4 and 10 percent from when it liberalized in 1991 through 2016.38 India, Brazil, Indonesia, Turkey, and South Korea became economic powerhouses, as did China in the second world (that is, among comparatively developed but predominantly hierarchical countries). Non-Western societies had waited out the early- and national-capitalist periods (1500-1885 and 1885-1965 respectively), but most accepted capitalism during the late 20th century. In doing so they skipped directly from traditional hierarchy into global capitalism. The Tech Revolution. A third industrial revolution every bit as epochal as its predecessors39 began unfolding in the United States during the late 1950s. Breakthroughs in electronics delivered the semiconductor, and computers began their ramifying series of new information technologies, bringing steep declines in production costs and marked increases in productivity. Automation displaced industrial workers as farm machinery had displaced agricultural workers during the late 19th century. Industrial employment in most advanced economies stood at about 25 percent of the labor force in 1820, peaked just after World War II at nearly 50 percent (32 percent in the United States), and was again back to around 25 percent by 1980.40 By 2010 it had declined to about 10 percent of employment in the United States and most first-world economies (but 22, 20, and 17 percent respectively in the robust manufacturing sectors of the German, Italian, and Japanese economies),41 made redundant by automation, relocation to the third world, and growing demand for services. As part of the tech revolution, robotics began coming into its own in the 21st century, further displacing industrial employment. Yet machines were becoming smarter, safer, more adaptable, more programmable, and less expensive, enabling first-world manufacturing to become more efficient than utilizing cheap labor in the third world and China.

Industrial employment may have been down, but industrial production still made up 29 percent of U.S. GDP in 1984 and 20 percent in 2015.42 Job replacement through technological development also took place in the service sector even as employment in the sector expanded overall. Drastic reductions in the labor needed to type, file, sort, manipulate, and transfer information occurred during the global era, radically transforming office jobs, just as those in spinning and weaving had been two centuries earlier. New technologies displaced large numbers of secretarial positions.43 Entire categories of service workers disappeared while other new ones appeared – floor traders were out, software engineers in, for example. Amid profound technological development and business innovation, an impressive entrepreneurialism arose in the United States under global capitalism, an extremely competitive culture of risk-taking whose epicenter was California’s Silicon Valley – like Wall Street in New York, a loose geographical designation but above all a culture and state of mind. Exuding a sense of limitless opportunity, those under its thrall bore the supreme confidence that if someone has a great idea and runs with it, they can achieve astounding things. Denizens of the Silicon Valley felt that all it takes to succeed is ability, boldness, energy, and perseverance. With or without credentials, two talented young people in jeans and T-shirts who presented a great idea to gatekeeping venture capitalists, angel investors, executives, corporate lawyers, or consultants could raise millions of dollars there. Even though the earlier extreme openness diminished to a degree in this century as engineers succeeded the area’s founding figures with their more diverse backgrounds, nowhere else has such opportunity ever been possible. As a consequence, many of the boldest and most creative from all over the world migrated to the United States, to the country’s great benefit. Abundant venture capital, outstanding universities, and a highly skilled labor force uniquely combined in the Silicon Valley with extreme entrepreneurialism, creativity, and receptivity to change. Where most cultures in human history have been conservative, this one was radical, spawning generation upon generation of technological change. The tech phase from the 1960s through the end of the century was primarily about building out the core information technologies of computers, the Internet, cell phones, and networking.

Even as that continued, the new phase in the early 21st century became tech, out to conquer the world economy. Legions of extraordinarily capable entrepreneurs and engineers in this phase of the tech revolution were freshly rethinking every corner of the economy, reducing the notion of technology to its essence, which is getting more from less. In their cerebral vision, technology was far more than electronics: It was everything from how banking is conducted to how transportation is organized; how medical knowledge is brought to bear on symptoms to how education is conducted; how customers pay for merchandise to how prospective mates are sorted, and from how materials are made to how cities are laid out. The Silicon Valley’s top entrepreneurs and engineers were extraordinarily talented human beings supremely confident that they were taking over the world, and they were doing precisely that. Entire industries large and small began to fall like overripe fruit, including many richly deserving displacement. The Silicon Valley ethos was, “We’re the smartest; we’re going to win; and if you don’t understand how, we don’t have the time to tell you.” Technology was rapidly moving toward dominance in the American and the world economies. Apple devoured entire global industries, including much of the world’s music industry. In the iPhone, it had the gold-standard smart phone worldwide. It had its eye on conquering television. Google was devouring Madison Avenue in a similar way. Cisco built out large portions of the global communications infrastructure. Facebook reached some 2 billion active users worldwide. Adages like “Software eats labor” and “Tech eats finance” exemplified the limitless confidence and competitiveness of the early 21st century Silicon Valley. In its crosshairs among vast numbers of other targets were the automobile and energy industries. The established auto industry was on the verge of major disruption at the hands of tech competitors to whom automobiles became computer platforms that ought to do everything for their owners, in addition to providing a superior driving experience. Teslas, for example, got new software updates automatically, had few moving parts, could be recharged at home, and needed minimal repair. The company had no dealer network; its cars were bought online. Dealerships were the old, national-era model. Tesla seemed to have more to fear from other tech companies than it did from GM or Toyota.

The lack of abundant, inexpensive, clean energy remained a bottleneck throughout the global era, although it was diminishing toward the end. Each previous industrial revolution had its new energy technology – the first, coal-burning steam power and the second, gasoline- burning internal combustion engines. The 1960s and 1970s developed nuclear power, but fission had daunting side-effects that increasingly rendered it politically unacceptable as an energy source. Research and development were going into the quest for alternative energy that was at last bearing fruit in solar, wind, and other efficient alternative energy sources. The Revolution in Finance. The United States also developed impressive new financial institutions and instruments that greatly facilitated the raising of capital for corporate ventures during the global era. Amid the large interest-rate fluctuations of the late 1970s, a new generation of financial theorists came onto the scene, with whose help finance became highly creative and much more efficient at matching investors with opportunities. Michael Milken’s innovations in high-yield bonds during the 1980s allowed smaller and riskier businesses access to the bond markets. During the 1990s the advent of options markets and rise of exchange-traded funds (ETFs), derivatives mimicking whole exchanges or portions of them such as industries, made possible unprecedented sophistication in hedging. Financial instruments could be devised to manage any conceivable risk that businesses and investors face ,as complex debt deals could be tailored to finely match the needs of companies and financial institutions. Select deregulation and competition between financial exchanges drastically reduced the costs of buying and selling instruments of all kinds, again sharply cutting the costs of doing business. A vast array of new derivatives made investment much less expensive and more efficient, resulting in an altogether more financially driven business environment. Amid the new financial acuity and prominence, ownership and management increasingly became separated. The advent of rapid-turnover institutional ownership during the 1970s and 1980s, followed by programmed trading, put serious strain upon the traditional role of boards of directors, bringing about a transformation in corporate governance. Plural, diverse, indirect, ephemeral investors had decreasing interest in participating in corporate governance. Shareholder control of corporate affairs was metamorphosing from internal politics or “voice,” to the threat of selling or “exit.”44 By late in the global era, tech was beginning to conquer finance as it had other industries, under the rubric of fintech or financial technology, taking apart and reorganizing finance with software.

Rethinking the very notion of banking, it considered banks to be lumbering and obsolete: They borrow people’s money, impose fees, support branches, pose credit risk, and require backup by the Federal Depository Insurance Corporation (FDIC). Retail banking is easily performed by software: Paypal and similar services pay bills, and eLoan extends credit. Bitcoin and other crypto-currencies also had powerful implications for banks as they did for other less advanced payment systems. When bills may be securely paid for fractions of 1 percent, and currency exchange becomes a free, frictionless ledger entry, what need was there for banks with their exorbitant fees and systemic risks? Crypto-currencies may or may not prove viable or significant in the long run, but they introduced important notions that were likely to own the future. Similarly revolutionary thinking was beginning to move into the insurance industry. The Revolution in Management. Large business achieved major productivity gains during the global era and continued to increase market share in the economy. Notable efficiency gains arose from corporations discovering that they do best when they stick to their core missions. For a time, particularly during the 1960s, such high-flying conglomerates as LTV, ITT, and Litton thought it advantageous to diversify and accumulate subsidiaries in many different industries; but it became clear during the 1970s that the need to diversify in such a manner applies only to investors, not to companies. As corporations learned to stay with what they knew best, the economy became more specialized, and each task was performed more efficiently. Unlike the haphazard mergers of the 1960s, those of the 1980s were all about synergies, finding elements of missions that had positive externalities for each other. Yet it took some care to define a core business properly. Business enterprises learned how to divide and allocate portions of their core missions utilizing much more varied structures than ever before to centralize some tasks and decentralize others as needed, enabling them to respond more effectively to the diverse exigencies that arose.45 Exotic organizational advances were among the innovations facilitated by the widespread use of management consulting. Relying upon consultants and contracting out disparate services enabled companies to stay trim and agile while meeting extremely well the many one-time-only problems with which they might otherwise have difficulty coping. Large corporations moved away from the turgid bureaucracy widespread throughout the national period.

Large corporations moved away from the turgid bureaucracy widespread throughout the national period. Lean new entities with flatter organizational structures arose in which layers of management were shed and responsibility widely delegated. The most competitive companies became organized into fast-moving, loosely coordinated enterprises capable of grouping and regrouping as needed. Self-managing teams increasingly utilized changing structures and tactics to run them, attaining degrees of flexibility unprecedented in large firms. Such adaptability took advantage of and demanded highly developed managerial skills and personal autonomy. With so much delegation of authority, a creative, independent spirit reached more deeply into corporate structures than ever before. This decentralization of authority entailed responsive management by alert human beings, not only allowing but requiring abundant input and discretion from below. That the hundred largest Fortune 500 corporations had eight times the inflation-adjusted revenue by the 2010s they did during the 1960s⁴⁶ was made possible by decentralization. So productive was decentralization that it diffused widely across the world and well beyond business. Such management gains were matched by others in marketing as weak retailers of all sizes gave way in market after market to strong ones that were frequently larger. First malls, then discounters and outlets, and then gigantic box stores thrived. Many of the largest, such as Walmart and Europe’s Carrefour superstores, became virtual small towns in themselves. In the process, personal service was often sharply cut back and great numbers of clerical and sales positions eliminated. From the late 1990s, Internet shopping accelerated many of these trends and put severe pressure on other forms of retailing. Amazon and other leading e-tailers’ facilities dwarfed the scale of traditional retail establishments. They became extremely automated and slashed real estate and labor costs, leaving much of traditional retail dead in the water. Unquestionably there was also human loss in all of this. The Competitive New Labor Markets. The compensation for the high-level executives, professionals, and technicians upon whom companies most relied went up steeply in the United States from the 1980s, as did the expectations placed upon them. The extraordinary potential rewards were matched by equally exceptional motivation, leading to ambition unimaginable to mid-20th century “organization men.”47 Accordingly, top employees worked more intensely and for longer hours. The great economic incentives and extreme effort were supercharged in start-up companies, whose normal pay was reduced and compensation in large part provided through awards of equity shares and stock options; as well as at investment banks where astronomical salaries lay ahead for those who made the grade. Such promise drove a single-minded new devotion to work that displaced everything else before it.

Such promise drove a single-minded new devotion to work that displaced everything else before it. The global markets also brought economic fear that spurred labor. The average annual hours worked in the United States were declining until 1975 but flat overall afterward despite increased incomes. By contrast, France’s work hours declined by 20 percent from 1975, Norway’s by 18 percent, and Spain’s by 16 percent from 1977 until the end of the era.48 The experience of being a private-sector employee was extremely different during the global era from what it had been in the mid-20th century. The national-era lifetime communal and moral commitments to each other of company and employee vanished.49 Not only did many employees participate in the entrepreneurialism of their companies, but many were essentially transformed into entrepreneurs of their own labor; investing in, managing, and marketing their careers, surprisingly often with astuteness and pluck. As they accumulated advantageous education and experience, their value in the labor market appreciated. In the hyper-competitive climate, corporations regularly treated their employees as commodities, and employees sometimes not only treated their corporations as commodities but treated themselves as such. At any time, they could be given ten minutes’ notice to clean out their desks and leave the building, and at any time they could give their companies short notice that they would have to find someone else. Many companies churned employees, and some employees churned employers. So turbulent did employment become that serial career change became widely accepted and expected. Job insecurity abounded, as did stoic acceptance of the same. As the steady but modest employment which most blue-collar workers knew during the national era yielded to the turbulent labor markets of the global era, workers faced waters more bracing than any they had known since the 19^(th) century. Factory employment receded, and once-protected craft jobs became insecure. The working class had been distinct and prominent during the national era, but it became sharply less so through the global era. From a peak of just under 50 percent of the labor force in 1947, union membership in the United States had declined to 11 percent by 2016.50 The primary remaining area of growing union membership during the global era was among public employees. Instead of parades of workers with their lunch boxes, it often became lone craftsmen with their enterprise, knowledge, marketing, and equipment aggressively driving their pick-up and panel trucks from job to job for relatively high pay. Their skills and responsibilities went up as did their profits, salaries, and wages.

Their skills and responsibilities went up as did their profits, salaries, and wages. Even janitorial work, yard work, housecleaning, and catering frequently became quite entrepreneurial. Some of the most enterprising hired their fellow workers and managed, marketed, and supported teams of service-providers, reinvesting their proceeds to build successful businesses. Workers became much more exposed to the economic markets during the global period than they had been at mid-century, and many became bourgeois and developed middle-class leanings, including political ones, often becoming resentful of high taxes and subsidies of the underclass, for example. Yet many other workers did not fare well. Nor were the professions spared as the markets pushed aside longstanding norms and practice in law, medicine, and the academy. Wrested from their once relatively independent, genteel, and secure lives, professionals, like laborers, became free to bob about in the markets. Subject to many of the same market forces as any other business, attorneys competed openly for clients in ways that would have gotten them disbarred for unprofessional conduct a few decades earlier. Yet attorneys were able to maintain many arbitrary and inefficient barriers against encroachment on their turf by nonprofessionals performing routine legal services. Many physicians were transformed into employees of relentlessly cost-cutting health maintenance organizations (HMOs) and other health service groups. Some even unionized out of desperation, but to little avail. A deathly combination of HMOs, insurance companies, regulations, liability laws, and decreasing Medicare payments constricted most physicians’ practices that remained nominally independent. Physicians were also under market assault from those in competing healthcare occupations charging less for their services. In higher education, triumphant administrators attuned to PR, marketing, and raising capital, increasingly shuffled professors around, occupied them with busywork, and held them accountable for attracting quotas of tuition and fee-paying students. Out of convenience for administrators and to cut costs, large numbers of professorships were converted to adjunct positions without benefits or privileges. The “freeway flyer” instructors taking these positions were at the mercy of the markets, driving between campuses and teaching numerous courses of doubtful quality on split shifts for low pay. Big Government and the Economic Crisis of the 1970s. Paradoxically, at the very onset of global capitalism, the United States underwent another large wave of expanding government with the Great Society programs of the late 1960s and early 1970s.

This countercurrent against the capitalist tide brought explosive growth of the welfare state and sharply increased dependency. Between 1960 and 1982, the share of U.S. GNP allocated to welfare expenditures soared from 10.3 percent to 19.3 percent.51 Eligibility requirements were loosened, and the welfare rolls more than doubled. According to Patterson, the number of Americans “on public assistance grew from 7.1 million in 1960, to 14.4 million in 1974.” All of this growth came from expansion of those on AFDC (Aid to Families with Dependent Children), which increased from 3.1 million in 1960 … to 10.8 million by 1974.”52 Social Security payments were increased several times during the 1970s and indexed against inflation under President Ford. Between 1970 and 1978 alone, disability programs broadened their coverage, eased eligibility requirements, and new awards rose 134 percent.53 Through the late 1960s and early 1970s, a vast array of welfare services opened lives of relative leisure to those willing to rely upon the dole. Many new social programs also made their appearance. Food stamps came into being in 1964, and as Neil Gilbert says, “between 1967 and 1978 the average number of monthly participants leaped from approximately 1.5 million to 16 million.”54 Medicare and Medicaid were established in 1965 under Social Security. Large-scale federal involvement in low-income housing arrived in the late 1960s. The newly instituted Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), among numerous other activities, cleared slums, built public housing, and offered rent subsidies for those of low income. A series of employment programs from Job Corps to the Comprehensive Employment and Training Act (CETA) was experimented with. A large, ramshackle War on Poverty was mounted under the Office of Economic Opportunity (OEO). Vaguely reminiscent of the New Deal’s National Recovery Administration (NRA), OEO encouraged the poor to organize and engage in community action. A spate of new federal regulatory agencies came in under the Nixon administration. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and Occupational Safety and Health Agency (OSHA) were established in 1970, followed by the Consumer Products Safety Commission in 1973. Many existing regulatory agencies were also expanded, while the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and other established agencies became much more activist. All had serious initial difficulties balancing their missions with the need of business to conduct itself profitably. With experience, the new agencies and endeavors ironed out some of their largest policy wrinkles.

The slow growth and high inflation of the 1970s, the global era’s first economic crisis, followed on the heels of this major new expansion of government. As large sums of money poured into both Great Society programs and the Vietnam War, inflation rose from 2 percent in 1965 to a peak of 13 percent in 1978. Painful recessions afflicted the country in 1970-71, 1974- 75, and 1980-81. Economic growth averaged only 2 percent during the 1970s, well below the historic U.S. average of 3.5 percent. As the welfare rolls expanded, social pathologies multiplied.55 Increasing resistance to irresponsible underclass56 conduct joined disappointment about the country’s economic performance to produce growing opposition to welfare. The Conservative Reaction and the Heyday of Global Capitalism. As the cultural cachet of the late 1960s and early 1970s waned, a conservative reaction began trimming the excesses from and reorienting big government. The reaction was anticipated in 1976 with the presidential election of Jimmy Carter, a Southern Democrat who promised to cut back government spending, introduce efficiency, and deregulate the economy. Carter’s most notable domestic achievement was the extensive deregulation introduced under economist Alfred Kahn, his deregulation czar. The latter’s first big project was decontrol of the airline industry via the virtual disbandment of the Civil Aeronautics Board (CAB), opening an era of price and route competition, vigorous expansion, and radical reorganization for the airlines. By the late 1970s deregulation of natural gas pipeline, telecommunications, and banking industries also occurred, as did some initial decontrol of utilities. The conservative reaction took hold first in the United Kingdom where a solid Tory majority was elected in 1979 under Margaret Thatcher, an able, principled, fiercely determined, and market-oriented prime minister who undertook sharp cutbacks of government involvement throughout the British economy. Conservatism surged in the United States during the 1980s under President Reagan, who, after the inflation and economic doldrums of the 1970s, pursued much of the reaction’s program against the excesses of the welfare and regulatory states. Banking and securities regulations were considerably loosened, and trucking was deregulated. Anti-trust enforcement was also relaxed, on the theory that in the absence of domestic competition, expanding international trade and competition offered sufficient protection against monopolism. The notion that regulatory policies ought to be cost effective gained wide currency. A few applications of the new free-market ideas were at once brilliant and radical, as in U.S. experiments with artificial markets in pollution rights. Reagan’s domestic reform proposals were for the most part stymied legislatively by Democratic majorities in both houses of Congress.

Reagan’s domestic reform proposals were for the most part stymied legislatively by Democratic majorities in both houses of Congress. Nevertheless, his reassuring manner, steadfast commitment, and great charisma enabled him to reach an extraordinary audience with his conservative message. When Reagan arrived on the political scene, conservatism was in marginal repute; when he left office, it was the reigning ideology. Reagan’s real power was moral and rhetorical. The force of his character was sustained by a contemplativeness that kept him earnestly in touch with the Protestant moral virtues he had acquired decades earlier in smalltown Illinois. As he prepared the way for the end of the Cold War, he also prepared the way for free-market economic policies. Only with Thatcher and Reagan was global capitalism fully under way. Despite the clamor building against it, welfare was relatively unscathed by the conservative reaction until the 1990s. Some of the most dramatic cutbacks of the era occurred when President Clinton acquiesced to welfare reforms under which able-bodied recipients were required to find work or lose their assistance. Unlike during the 1930s, the inefficiency and heavy-handedness of government were blamed, while the free markets were largely cast in the role of hero. The welfare and regulatory states were pruned and partly transformed toward compatibility with the markets. More Big Government. Entitlement spending accelerated in the 21^(st) century as medical, disability, and retirement entitlements multiplied and expanded. The Cadillac care and third-party payment written into Medicare early on combined with demographic imbalance and growing monopolism to create increasing financial drain. The extension of disability eligibility to millions of additional claimants lay behind much of the problem. Under the new mandates, the healthcare industry in the United States soared to 17 percent of US GDP by 2014.57 Even as the conservative reaction brought about selective deregulation, the U.S. economy continued to undergo increased regulation overall. Dense new regulation grew up around businesses of all sizes, including costly environmental and safety measures. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 burdened corporations with reporting requirements and increased their vulnerability to civil and criminal law. Employment law was another area of growing legal intrusion. Employees could be terminated at will during the 1950s unless unionized or in the government sector. Many of them still could be, but some private employees acquired partial property rights in their jobs, protecting them from termination except for documentable cause and/or entitling them to severance pay when discharged. Employees gained much-expanded civil rights with respect to their privacy, speech, and conduct on the job.

Employees gained much-expanded civil rights with respect to their privacy, speech, and conduct on the job. They won the right to freedom from discrimination or harassment at work and the right to family leaves. As liability claims became more costly, jobs were cut. Nevertheless, the U.S. labor market remained more open than those of almost all European countries. Civil law was another area of growing economic intervention. The scope for litigation expanded greatly during the global era thanks to an activist bench and creeping special-interest legislation for trial lawyers. Class-action lawsuit requirements loosened dramatically. Fraudulent or dubious personal injury claims sometimes resulted in preposterous awards, transforming the economy. Punitive judgments echoed the confiscatory “liturgies” of ancient Rome, and in many cases property again became insecure. In an atmosphere of rampant predation, unscrupulous law firms began fleecing law-abiding companies with frivolous securities fraud suits. Legal defensiveness distorted a great deal of American business; that of medicine, absurdly. Liberal courts and trial attorneys became the analogs of officials administering the welfare and regulatory states, only in lottery fashion. On the other hand, regulation was remiss in the insufficiency of its anti-trust oversight. Monopolism again became a major problem as industries underwent horizontal integration through anti-competitive practices. A handful of oligopolistic companies gained control of the automobile rental industry and restricted price competition. Reconsolidation of the oil companies contributed to increased oil prices via manipulation of spot-market trading and refinery output through much of the era. Regulation was perhaps most botched, however, in the financial sector. The Great Recession. The Economic Crisis of 2008-2009, the second and more acute economic crisis of the global era, in which most developed countries lost 4 to 6 percent of their GDPs, was the worst downturn since the 1930s. From the first quarter of 2008 through the second quarter of 2009, the U.S. economy declined by 5.4 percent. Most less-developed economies underwent milder declines, although there was large variation in this. World GDP loss was 3.5 percent. Like the Great Depression before it, the Great Recession encountered severe turbulence in the financial markets, and the global financial system began unraveling. Amid a decreasing supply of money, so many financial institutions had engaged in irresponsible lending and were facing bad debt that they were compelled to halt further lending and build up capital to bring balance sheets into compliance with regulatory requirements. Ominously, many large entities with vast and reverberating financial obligations were veering toward or falling into failure, creating ever-widening tsunamis of illiquidity.

No financial institution felt secure lending to any other. Credit frequently being no longer available, many corporations could not pay their bills or invest, and many consumers could not spend. Businesses laid off workers, and unemployment began rising sharply. Extremely costly government efforts to manhandle the ailing economies and cushion hardship brought a sharp increase in the already inordinately large national deficits and debts of most developed global-capitalist economies, aggravating the fiscal crisis. The Obama administration used the recession not as an opportunity to overhaul U.S. regulatory policy in a manner supportive of the markets, nor as one to address outof-control entitlement or healthcare costs, nor to prime the Keynesian pump by setting up temporary programs – it used the recession as a free pass to permanently ramp up government spending, creating major additional drag on the economy. Ambiguous Congressional flailing at financial institutions delivered the Dodd-Frank Banking Act of 2010, further reducing lenders’ willingness to extend credit. As developed economies underwent comparatively weak recoveries from late 2009 through early 2011, financial and economic disorder subsided in the United States but mounted in Europe. Meanwhile, labor force participation in the United States declined from a peak of 67 percent in 2000 to 62.5 percent in November of 2015. Of that 4.5 percent decline, 3.5 percent occurred after 2008.58 Of the decline, about half owed to changing demographics with the aging of the baby-boom generation. Just over half of the remaining portion stemmed from increased disability enrollment. The European Economies under Global Capitalism. The major European economies again reached levels approaching America’s by the early 1970s, levels they had not witnessed since the onset of World War II.60 Their positive recoveries occurred with strong socialist legacies and bigger government than in the United States. Through the 1970s, northern European countries consolidated many-faceted, cradle-to-grave systems of social protection, while southern European countries assembled less extensive ones, coexisting with greater economic corruption. Amid increased inflation and losses of manufacturing and mining jobs, growth rates in Europe settled back to a more modest pace during the 1970s, not unlike that in the United States.61 Slow growth emanating from extensive welfare and regulatory states continued into the 1980s in much of Europe.

Some European countries encountered reaction against big government during the late 1970s that curtailed the nationalization of industries and began their privatization. Britain took the lead as Margaret Thatcher closed state-owned enterprises in the oil, coal mining, airline, telephone, automobile, shipbuilding, and other industries. She privatized public housing by selling units to their inhabitants on generous financial terms. She pursued deregulation on many fronts and encouraged entrepreneurship, most notably in banking and finance. Wherever she could, Thatcher sought to weaken labor unions. A limited, somewhat analogous development occurred in France when Socialist President François Mitterand, in office since 1981, vigorously nationalizing banks and extending welfare benefits, underwent his historic pirouette in 1982 to endorse his chief opponent Raymond Barre’s fiscal and monetary conservatism. In selling off France’s inefficient, stateowned mines, albeit haltingly, Mitterand too signaled a tendency away from the traditional socialist element of the welfare state even in continental Europe, at least for a time. Although other countries followed to a degree, government in Europe kept growing in different ways and overall. Europe’s labor markets for the most part remained tightly regulated. Laying off workers has been extremely difficult and costly for employers in most of Europe. Jobs there, to a large extent, became and remained property rights whereas, despite some movement in that direction, they generally did not in the global-era United States. The professions in Europe, as in much of the world, also managed to retain more restrictive certification requirements and monopoly power than they did in the United States. British attorneys, for example, were long able to maintain special privileges that their American peers could not. Riddled with archaic regulations, Greek labor law was extreme, allowing 70 closed occupations, from attorneys to truck drivers, to retain monopolistic privileges.62 Nevertheless, various European countries made strides toward opening their labor markets, including Ireland, the Netherlands, Denmark, Slovakia, Estonia, and even Greece, in addition to the United Kingdom. Nor did Europe accommodate entrepreneurialism to the same degree as the United States. Critical Silicon Valley legal and financial arrangements were missing across the Atlantic. The United States’ highly entrepreneurial start-up charters, great engines of efficiency, were illegal in many European countries. France did not allow the liquidity priority for preferred stock – through which founder and venture capitalist investments are protected against ruinous dilution of their early holdings by subsequent management. European law did not allow 20 percent of startup companies’ stock to be set aside for employee incentive plans as in the United States.

American firms could, but European firms could not, allocate to a key executive, engineer, or idea-person 1 or 2 percent of the company, for which he then gave his all for modest pay and the chance to make millions in capital gains. European tax treatment of options was also generally unfavorable to entrepreneurialism. European equity markets were poorly developed, making it excessively difficult for companies to go public. Europe had no equivalent to the NASDAQ small-cap market for medium-sized companies. Consequently, European venture capitalists had no convenient way of selling their shares as start-ups began to mature. Since they could not easily liquidate their investments, they could not easily make new ones. The absence of a European high-yield debt market further hampered entrepreneurialism. Nor was there any European equivalent to the business-savvy, entrepreneurially-minded law firms willing to push the envelope in legal innovation that were found in the creative centers of the American economy. European financial law barred many efficient, enterprising ways of allocating money. The European Sovereign Debt Crisis. Not surprisingly, given their uphill battle with big government, European financial institutions were under considerable pressure from unsustainable sovereign debt owed most notably by Greece, Italy, Belgium, Portugal, and Spain. European banks lent these predominantly Catholic and Mediterranean countries sums that they were going to have a difficult time mustering the political will to repay. In the irrational exuberance of the late 2000s in Europe, some of the borrowing governments, Ireland and Spain for example, poured funds into subsidized housing booms as did the United States. Greece, the most overextended of the five, devoted its resources largely to government pensions and other state benefits.63 Greece resisted reforming a defunct tax system, trimming civil service rolls, and breaking guild and union strangleholds to make itself more competitive. European banks’ lending, much of it for excessively leveraged sovereign debt, made them financially vulnerable. The greater scale of those banks than their American counterparts compounded the financial dangers. Southern Europe in particular allowed its economic problems to worsen. Italy had no net GDP growth after 2001.64 Its small business limped along in chaotic fashion, with highly creative small firms dotting the countryside of northern Italy, engaged in everything from furniture manufacturing to graphic design. But the country left these firms hardly any way around impossible burdens and restrictions other than via corruption.

Although France tried for a time during the 1980s to curb the growth of its welfare state, the latter continued to grow. In order to pay part of the bill, income taxes were increased to 75 percent under President Hollande for those in the highest income bracket for the 2013 tax year. After poor results, the top tax rate was reduced to 45 percent two years later. A wealth tax was also instituted for those whose net worth exceeded €800,000 although it was soon rescinded. Where French labor was organized, companies and unions took a confrontational mode, working against rather than with each other, and often against the government as well. Exports languished, and the French economy had virtually no growth between 2008 and 2016.66 Northern European economic performance was much better than Southern and held down by the latter. From the 1990s, Germany presented an impressive example of how the North cooperatively coped. Germany’s guiding philosophy was that the country needed to stay economically healthy, and that major economic interests should not harm the productive engine that made everything possible. This approach entailed reaching out on all sides and compromising. Germany pared down its welfare and regulatory excesses even as it was shouldering the weight of reintegrating East Germany and paying disproportionately into EU coffers. It weathered the 2008–2009 downturn while running only the thinnest of deficits, although it did allow its banks to become dangerously exposed. Kurzarbeit, or working shorter hours during economic crises in return for a degree of job security, an approach that was not even thinkable in the United States, played a central role in Germany’s economic success. Kurzarbeit was about retaining an exceptionally well-trained labor force in order to keep standards and productivity high. German management understood that holding onto a quality workforce was important because difficult to replace, and it wanted to be positioned to rebound at once and in top form when demand returned. Organized labor played a pivotal role in this commendable accord by exchanging flexibility in work hours for job security. Kurzarbeit was an unusual example of intelligent, win-win, productivity-enhancing restriction of the labor markets. Although with hesitation and reservations, German unions negotiated cooperatively with business, also agreeing to relatively modest salaries, wages, pensions, and benefits, with an eye to the long term.

Germany’s exemplary training and apprenticeship programs developed out of long-established guild traditions, another case of cooperation on all sides. They may have had other problems, but the Scandinavian countries also showed liberal societies how to address their economic ones. For example, as The Economist notes, “Sweden … reduced public spending as a proportion of GDP from 67 percent in 1993 to 49 percent [in 2013]. Its public debt fell from 70 percent of GDP in 1993 to 37 percent in 2010, and its budget moved from an 11-percent deficit to a surplus of 0.3 percent over the same period,” even as it was tightening its pension system.67 Sweden also substantially cut its tax rate for those with the highest incomes, a reduced its corporate tax, and removed various taxes on wealth.68 The Japanese economy soared during the first half of the global era, surging to world leadership in steel, shipbuilding, automobiles, and consumer electronics. Its management techniques became as good as any in the world. Japan maintained a lean welfare state complemented by familial social obligations. By the late 1980s, Japanese firms were buying large amounts of commercial real estate in Los Angeles and other U.S. cities, striking fear in sections of the American business community. Japanese GDP growth averaged 10 percent annually during the 1960s, 5 percent during the 1970s, and 4 percent during the 1980s,69 but only 0.9 percent from 1992 to 2016.70 Japan’s national debt was only a moderate 0.6 times GDP in 1990, but after greatly increased borrowing its debt reached a forbidding 2.5 times GDP by the mid-2010s.71 Liberalizing Third-World Economies under Global Capitalism. The spread of capitalism during the global era brought about the industrialization of most of the third-world economy. Drawing upon enormous foreign investment, third-world countries realigned with the global markets and greatly expanded their industrial production. Global industrial output increased sharply from 1965 and service-sector output even more sharply. Major efficiency gains occurred as complex services became concentrated in the first world and basic manufacturing and agriculture in the third world. As the third world increased its competitiveness in complex services in the 21^(st) century, they too increasingly benefited from outsourcing. Capitalism brought unprecedented growth to liberalizing third-world societies, but their economic ascent was arduous. Global markets upended a great deal of traditional economic protection before third-world societies had the resources, time, and orientation to temper the markets with any but minimal welfare and regulation.

Capitalism brought unprecedented growth to liberalizing third-world societies, but their economic ascent was arduous. Global markets upended a great deal of traditional economic protection before third-world societies had the resources, time, and orientation to temper the markets with any but minimal welfare and regulation. In the absence of welfare, third-world countries relied upon persisting communal and kinship ties that offered much but not all support in times of need. Although their traditional communal supports were much disturbed, they did not disintegrate to the degree they have in the West. As special-interest giveaways, bloated welfare expenditures, and burdensome regulations weighed down most first-world economies, crony capitalism afflicted most third-world ones. In their crony capitalism, insiders embedded in strong communal, clientelist relationships worked closely with government officials, enabling them to operate in circumstances of legal ambiguity. Powerful patrons received favorable treatment from officials while patrons gave them direct and indirect stakes in their business dealings. The crony capitalism widespread today in Asia was prevalent in early modern Europe and continued in Mediterranean countries through the global period, albeit with reduced generality and force. Cronyism is associated with the tendency of much third-world capitalism to operate top-down, providing another link to the hierarchical societies of recent centuries with their mercantilist policies. Accordingly, ambitious, rising Asian and other economies frequently dampened domestic demand, lowered currency values, erected import barriers, and ran trade surpluses with the world. Their governments often encouraged particular industries, as South Korea did with its push into semiconductors. That country’s D-RAM business was built clumsily via heavy-handed government subsidy and leverage. Indonesia’s project to manufacture jet planes was another top-down boondoggle. On the other hand, Brazil’s aircraft industry was successful, though partly top-down. Despite the spectacular growth of the Asian economies, a great deal of resource misallocation occurred in them and in other developing economies. Popular concessions like food subsidies and energy price controls also hindered many thirdworld economies. At the other end of the economic and geographic scale from the firstworld centers of global capitalism were the least developed portions of Africa, Latin America, and Asia, which some termed the fourth world. There vast, chaotic slums teemed with millions of desperate hawkers of everything from dirty water to recycled plastic, sunglasses, and telephone cards. Lagos, Nigeria largely made up a single gargantuan slum of 15 million or more out of a megalopolitan population of approximately 20 million, whose inhabitants survived as they were able among sprawling garbage heaps and whose daily hardship was gnawing and life expectancy short.72 Such places existed as eddies removed from the main currents of thirdworld development.

The street hustlers of fetid fourth-world slums and the executives and professionals of sleek office towers and business parks experienced the same hurricane-force winds of global economic markets, although worlds apart and with extremely differently preparation for them. Hierarchical Economies under Global Capitalism. Although market economies became dominant in most third-world countries, hierarchical ones continued to exist in North Korea, Saudi Arabia, Iran, and numerous other oil-producing countries as well as in much of sub-Saharan Africa. The most important hierarchical economies were not in the third world but the second world, particularly in China and Russia. Their economies no longer manifested the hard opposition to capitalism that they had during the national era, but the dominant hierarchical sectors were controlled for state purposes by authoritarian regimes arrayed geopolitically against global-liberal ones. Moreover, the weighty, elite portions of their private sectors have close relationships with the government and tend to make decisions with an eye to regime approval. Deng Xiaoping began boldly reforming the Chinese economy in 1979, from an almost entirely socialist one toward one with a rapidly growing capitalist sector. He began with limited return of rural land to peasants as private plots, transforming them into farmers producing for the markets. Where Mao was a poet and idealist, Deng and his successors were pragmatic managers. The Deng regime was devoted to development, emphasizing increased economic and military power. “The smashing of the iron rice bowl” was an early Deng policy and slogan repudiating society’s paternalistic obligations to the people; there was to be no further state guarantee of subsistence. China’s legal infrastructure for a market society lagged badly until about 2000 but then developed rapidly, with the help of a great deal of imported American business law. The regime supercharged economic development through such measures as keeping tax rates low and placing huge emphasis upon elite educational institutions. Nevertheless, having little ability to innovate because of the closedness their regime required, the Chinese rulers turned to the wholesale theft of intellectual property. Paradoxically, even as party leaders allowed the emergence of numerous billionaires and accorded them accolades, they continued to disparage and discriminate against former landowning families.73 As for the Soviet Union, when special access to import stores, shopping sprees to the West, and access to Western popular culture became prime rewards to the elite, as they did from the 1960s through the 1980s, it was only a matter of time before key sections of the society would openly advocate capitalism and support fundamental reform. In an era of jet travel and instant electronic communication,", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634243384_cleaned.txt:37:1bf7603adee1", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 1227, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634243384_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634243384", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634243384_cleaned", "chunk_index": 38, "text": "them accolades, they continued to disparage and discriminate against former landowning families.73 As for the Soviet Union, when special access to import stores, shopping sprees to the West, and access to Western popular culture became prime rewards to the elite, as they did from the 1960s through the 1980s, it was only a matter of time before key sections of the society would openly advocate capitalism and support fundamental reform. In an era of jet travel and instant electronic communication, revolutionary socialism was no longer viable without enormous coercion to counter the appeal of the productive and charismatic markets. As communism began collapsing in Eastern Europe in 1989, its newly Western-oriented, formerly occupied countries turned to markets and swiftly joined to the first world. The other contiguous non-Russian dependencies floundered for the most part, some reverting from second- to third-world status. Russia was able to make lurching first steps into the economic markets under Yeltsin and Yegor Gaidar in 1992. In the years afterward its economy opened more to the markets but came under domination by the secret police and billionaire oligarchs careful to stay in their favor. Amid political and legal menace, Russian business had to tread carefully around and defer to the privileged hierarchy prevalent in its upper reaches. As Hernando DeSoto says, “Russia and the more hierarchical former Soviet dependencies … look astonishingly similar” to Latin American countries like Mexico and Columbia, having “strong underground economies, glaring inequality, pervasive mafias, political instability, capital flight, and flagrant disregard for the law,”74 but Russia was more developed than they. After a turbulent period of uncertainty, it settled back into second-world status with China. T he Pax Americana as the Foundation of Global Capitalism. The Pax of global capitalism and all that flowed from it. Global capitalism owed everything to the allied victory in World War II that destroyed the Axis regimes and with them the world’s most virulent sources of militarism and among its most virulent sources of vicious economic practice. The United States, Britain, and their liberal allies were in a position after the war to foster the international economic markets they valued. Had the Pax Americana or something similar to it not been established and maintained, the period would have witnessed a continuation of the wars of conquest and dog-eat-dog mercantilist practices of the 31-year crisis. International trade had flourished under the Pax Britannica, and it flourished again under the Pax Americana. But it had stagnated as economies went through the 31-year crisis with the liberal international order under assault by powerful hierarchical societies and their ways and ideas. That it took until the early 1970s for international trade to again reach the levels of 1913 as a percentage of GDP is testimony to how devastating the international conflict of the 31-year crisis had been to economic markets.75 Throughout history, the master key to the blossoming and", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634243384_cleaned.txt:38:cb986511cd20", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 1228, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634243384_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634243384", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634243384_cleaned", "chunk_index": 39, "text": "again under the Pax Americana.

That it took until the early 1970s for international trade to again reach the levels of 1913 as a percentage of GDP is testimony to how devastating the international conflict of the 31-year crisis had been to economic markets.75 Throughout history, the master key to the blossoming and spread of capitalism has been outflanking the power of the state to pounce imperiously upon the conduct and profits of business. In order to thrive, business had to have a way out of the hierarchical straitjacket that inevitably stifled it. Prerequisite to the globalization of the economic markets was the prior globalization of a minimalist, hands-off, low-key international order, placing a reality check on authoritarian rulers and their cronies’ ceaseless efforts to arrogate all things to themselves.76 Interests and the Demonstration Effect in the Spread of Capitalism. Once made safe from depredation, thanks to a liberal security regime, international economic markets reward regimes that embrace them and punish those that shun them. Under these circumstances, no rational state dare resist the economic markets for long without weakening itself in relation to other states. First-, second-, and third-world countries alike have faced the basic reality under the Pax Americana that avoiding the economic markets was contrary to reason of state and futile. The demonstration effect of observing the success that capitalism brought to other countries played a pivotal role in the spread of capitalism after 1965. The striking initial examples were Germany and Japan’s spectacular postwar recoveries, but their cases were unpersuasive because it was too easy to invoke special national-cultural explanations for their successes. More compelling were the robust recoveries of Britain and the United States from the doldrums of the 1970s under the free-market policies of Thatcher and Reagan. Their healthy growth through the 1980s was notable because it followed the disappointing results of both countries’ anti-market policies of the 1960s and 1970s. Most compelling though were the “four tigers,” Hong Kong, Singapore, South Korea, and Taiwan, all of which became third-world economic wonders by the 1980s through adherence to free-market principles. Their spectacular economic ascents caused a global sensation. The Asian neighbors of the four tigers had bleacher seats from which to watch and emulate their development. Then there were the negative cases of the USSR, Cuba, North Korea, Albania, and Burma, among others at the time – all going nowhere with heavy-handed statist policies. The collapse of the Soviet Union boosted the spread of capitalism by further discrediting the hierarchical model, an event that was particularly consequential for India.

The message that countries attentive to reality had to get with the capitalist program was amplified by their business communities whose experience in the markets and whose interests made them especially enthusiastic about the markets. Elites and whole nations absorbed the lessons around them and resolved to play catch-up and raise themselves to wealth and power. Insofar as calculations of national interest coincided with the perceived interest of governing classes, they were crucial in the political contests over the expansion of the markets. Nearly all third-world countries were still traditional-hierarchical during the 1960s. Collectivist, possessing rich community, and able to count on natural sharing if the threat of destitution arose, nothing was more difficult and counterintuitive for them than to accept economic markets. Nevertheless, it got through to most third-world elites and leaders that adopting capitalism was the only way their countries could achieve sustainable growth and acquire prosperity and power. In numerous cases their adoptions of the markets were substantially defensive, undertaken in order that competing countries not get ahead of them. Although the results were plain to see, many Middle Eastern and sub-Saharan African countries and Cuba resisted, typically because their hierarchical rulers feared that they would not be able to retain control if they acted in their countries’ best interests. Why the Tech Revolution? The central cause of the continuing industrial revolution in the first world and the industrialization of the third world was capitalist economic growth. Market-derived economic growth brought the first industrial revolution of the late 18^(th) and early 19^(th) centuries, and further economic growth brought each subsequent wave of the industrial revolution. Industrialization spread to the third world because free markets and free trade preceded it and because technological progress in transportation and communication made large-scale global trade efficient. Container ships so sharply reduced transportation costs that it became profitable to move even bulky items all over the world when done on a sufficiently large scale. Internet and telephone technologies allowed nearly free instantaneous communication and distribution of digital products worldwide. The third world long had the potential for low-cost production, but other than Japan it only adopted the institutional means of bringing it about and became the beneficiary of the technological means of overcoming its geographical remoteness from the mid-1960s. The Silicon Valley’s bubbling creativity and hyper-entrepreneurialism were rooted in the distinctive Californian and especially northern Californian culture of rebellious questioning and experimentation.

Its economic innovativeness was homologous with the beatnik and hippie movements and student revolt that began in the San Francisco Bay Area. The region’s longstanding social and cultural boldness also manifested itself in economic boldness. An almost two-century-old tradition born of the experience of diversity, uprootedness, and unusual individualism lay behind this. Even the state’s childrearing highlighted extreme freedom. California’s market-savvy children grew up skeptical about authority, questioning tradition, and streetwise in economic and all other markets. Participating in global markets was difficult for nearly everyone, but astonishingly many Californians took to it with gusto. In part, the Silicon Valley also depended upon its great universities, particularly Stanford and U.C. Berkeley. Europe and Asia’s business-people grew up in more coherent, reassuring, and confining settings that did not lend themselves to all-out innovation. Californians’ individualism arose from experience in many-sided markets, and it complemented and furthered them during the global era. Replicating the sociocultural conditions of their profound entrepreneurialism was a tall order. The pace of technological change accelerated in part because the infrastructure of innovation was built out in the United States to make funding start-ups routine and inexpensive. An entire venture capital industry came into being to facilitate the flow of money to start-ups. The era’s larger, more variegated, more flexible, and more efficient capital markets meant that the ideas of the most creative were able to gain funding in ways that had never before been possible. It was revolutionary that founding start-ups became inexpensive and routine. Technological change also accelerated because of the growing awareness that technological development was central to the capitalist economy and held enormous economic potential. Why the Revolution in Finance? The global era’s unparalleled innovations in finance drew upon outstanding innovation in the theory of finance. Just as natural science only began strongly contributing to engineering development and economic growth during the national era, economic science only began doing so in earnest during the global era. One of the most important means was through the new theory of finance with its brilliant series of discoveries about and prescriptions for the financial markets beginning in the 1960s.77 Underlying the entire revolution was the work of ubiquitous arbitragers looking for and often quickly correcting price discrepancies. These financial innovations made possible the vast expansion of derivatives markets all over the world with their enormous efficiency gains (and negative externalities). One of the key ways in which they enhanced efficiency was by clarifying the logic and necessity of hedging.7 The revolution in finance led to global capitalism’s more financially driven economy.

One of the key ways in which they enhanced efficiency was by clarifying the logic and necessity of hedging.7 The revolution in finance led to global capitalism’s more financially driven economy. Why the Revolution in Management? Corporate structures became flatter and more streamlined during the global era in part because under global markets’ severe economic competition, it was no longer feasible to support the tall, unitary, bureaucratic pyramids of the early national era or often even the medium-height, semi-autonomous divisional pyramids of the later national era. They became too expensive and cumbersome. Corporate structures also became leaner and more dynamic because technological development helped enable them to become profitable. The extremely inexpensive communication available first allowed and then required decentralization. Businesses could no longer afford to provide the number of managers or stability of employment for them. Efficient new management tools and just-in-time inventory controls making use of the new technologies also reduced bureaucratic overhead. Part of what allowed the flatter structures were also the extraordinary skills and extreme commitment of the era’s business executives, as is analyzed in chapter 4. Complementing the unparalleled skills of in-house managers, the widespread use of management consultants helped enable the customized, streamlined, exotic, new structures to work and spread. The new pattern of corporate governance by the markets left greater room for discretion on the part of management. Such governance provided additional incentives for managers but also permitted abuses, as in the opportunistic recklessness at Enron and at various financial institutions leading up to the banking crisis of 2008-2009. Management was also able to use its new power to some extent to award itself unjustifiably high compensation packages. Exponentially increasing organizational, managerial, and financial sophistication, aided by the explosion of information technologies, continued to generate higher returns to scale, contributing to growth in the size of business firms all over the world. Economies of scale were captured in retail through centralizing marketing decisions, building attractive product lines, and cutting costs. Increasing scale brought superior branding, advertising, and marketing. Larger retailers were able to drive down costs and out-compete smaller retailers by sedulously seeking products in the cheapest markets of the world. E-tailers like Amazon trounced competition and grew rapidly by eliminating retail space and employee overhead. Rapidly advancing knowledge of business practices was part of what made possible the global reach of corporations.

It is illegal in the United States for a chain to put in a store near an existing independent, undercut it until it goes out of business, and then raise prices. Yet such conduct is also difficult to prosecute, a story that was repeated countless times. U.S. hesitancy to protect small business with European-, Japanese-, or Indian-style anti-chain regulations contributed to the process, as did a legislative political class eager to serve the special interests. Why the More Competitive Labor Markets? As the wide-open labor markets of the global era eroded the many supports of the company men of the national era, and people were thrown onto their own resources, the circumstances of the working class changed radically. Large numbers of workers who once held secure jobs had scant choice but to become managers of their own careers and proprietors of their own labor, making the best of the discipline and savviness their circumstances conferred. Many of those tested by the markets, often in service jobs, were able to rise into the middle class, but many others were not. As workers were tossed about by the vagaries of corporate balance sheets, more of them also became wary and manipulative, feeling little beholden to employers and freely jumping between them when able. Increased outsourcing, advanced automation, and more competitive labor markets reduced industrial employment, dispersed the working class, gave it more varied experience, and rendered it less visible than during the previous era. Labor unions greatly weakened in the private sector because international trade punished business as that allowed unions to use monopoly power to gain wages and salaries departing significantly from those of the free market. Industry after industry in which labor did not respect the fierce competition of robust international markets, and/or in which business did not successfully evade or fend it off, went under. The oligopolistic U.S. automobile industry went into a long, slow, agonizing death spiral in large part because it was not able to compete well internationally after having caved in to patently shortsighted and exploitative UAW demands. Neither management nor union bosses had the integrity and courage to correct what both long knew were unsustainable agreements. Unions found abodes in the public sector under global capitalism where their monopolism latched onto that of the state, sapping not particular industries and businesses, but the strength of the nation, or in relatively monopolistic corners of the private economy like Boeing Aircraft, where they did something similar.

Organized labor may have protested cheap competition from abroad, but it was able to do little about its plight other than divert some of the spoils of existing monopolies where possible. American unions – though not German ones – were different varieties of the same kudzu as the guild encrustation that throttled 15^(th) -century Bruges, Ypres, and Ghent. In an amoral setting, only discipline forced upon unions by the global markets kept them cut back. Much of the autonomy of the professions eroded under global capitalism for reasons similar to those behind the weakening of most unions, for they were often no longer able to protect themselves from competition. Growing government involvement was crowding the medical profession, as were its competitors. Voters were unwilling to tolerate many legal restrictions protecting professional privilege because of the strength of the markets and the culture supporting them. Were the global markets to recede, private-sector unions and professional privilege would return with a vengeance. As labor markets became more competitive in many respects, the drumbeat of advertising was spreading consumerism, intensifying the powerful economic motivation already present. In the world of materialism, the “winners” were associated with symbols of success disseminated through the media and the “losers” with those of failure. Consumerism became so deeply imbedded as to displace other aspects of life. Sociologist Daniel Bell, among others during the late 1960s, became concerned that the abundance and materialism accompanying advanced capitalism would erode the work discipline necessary to sustain the system, leading people to withdraw from the labor force into leisure.79 Not to worry! Advertising and marketing achieved precisely the opposite, raising economic expectations and motivation to feverish levels, bringing a slavish new devotion to the material. Far from rendering people unfit for employment, global capitalism suspended mechanical rabbits of consumption in front of them, capturing their desires for its own purposes. The American dream and similar dreams all over the world were redefined in more materialistic ways. The era’s extreme materialism was part of what made the labor markets highly competitive. Advertising’s seductive messages insinuated powerful wedges of desire into consumers, who longed for myriads of new objects and services without most of which they had long been perfectly content and frequently better off altogether.

Advertising’s seductive messages insinuated powerful wedges of desire into consumers, who longed for myriads of new objects and services without most of which they had long been perfectly content and frequently better off altogether. Living in a world of unreal images, people scurried about for the right clothes or electronic devices, arranged to frequent the right restaurants and shops, and exhausted themselves for housing at the right addresses – most of which represented withdrawal from reality and meaning to dwell in a noisy, distorted, this-worldly anti-nirvana. The world of objects became a generalized hysteria in which the symptom shifted from place to place.80 Advertising fanned the flames of appetite, dangling sex, envy, hunger, and delusion, riveting attention to wants instead of needs, obligations, or service. On behalf of capitalist economic interests, advertising installed escalating material want and fleeting satisfaction as a false salvation. Money gave misplaced cultural power to the pretensions of the empty, undermining the ability of the full to stand their genuine ground. The traditional progressive model of government as provider for the general interest and simple benefactor of the people is partly correct; government did achieve national and internal security, establish economic infrastructure, regulate monopolism, secure the rule of law, alleviate collective public health threats, and so forth. As a whole, however, it carried out these tasks poorly and inefficiently. Over and above patently necessary defense and regulatory endeavors, the bulk of the government’s direct and indirect drain on the economy was made up of bureaucratic overhead, social programs, and regulatory impositions which only the beholden or naïve could accept as unambiguously answering genuine need rather than serving special interests. Increasingly numerous and powerful special interests demanding government subsidies or regulations for their own purposes lay behind most growth of government during the global era. The special interests begin with those of the political class. Ever more baldly and systematically treating government policy as their personal capital, politicians, civil servants, and those around them produced continual accretions of interested, needless expenditure and regulation. The special interests bring formidable resources to the political table. As James Buchanan, Mancur Olson, and others have taught social scientists, it was much easier to organize special than general interests.81 The general interest is at a particular disadvantage during times in which the interest of the whole is supported by neither a committed and engaged public nor by principled officials. Once a government program is in place, the special interests defending it become dug in, have resources in place, and are extremely difficult to dislodge. Powerful special interests including politicians, bureaucracies, unions, and corporations with stakes in government policy, along with the recipients of disproportionate services, have held the country in a tightening vice.

The result was the terminal sucking of resources into unsustainable and poorly managed entitlements together with the regulatory waste of private sector resources on a comparable scale. A telltale sign of the provenance of the Great Recession and following economic doldrums was that for the first time in the nation’s history, more very high-income households were found in metropolitan Washington, DC than in New York, San Francisco, Los Angeles, Houston, or the other centers of the productive private economy.82 Growing government from 1965 onward drew importantly upon the anger and perceived interests of multiculturalist groups that were able to successfully argue claims of injustice against the society. It drew upon a social ethic that was no longer directed toward need in general but toward attempting to redress alleged collective injustice. Black discontent in particular was unmistakably the deepest concern of the American social programs of the 1960s and 1970s.83 The fundamental leanings of program recipients and protected employees, those with secure government and monopolistic corporate jobs and/or union membership, are the second major cause of the inexorably growing burden of government. For, apart from their interests, their experience of economic independence or dependence shapes the character of people and classes such that their basic ways of feeling, thinking, and acting bend in different directions. Those who depend upon government or monopoly become accustomed to economic security and favor hierarchical solutions to economic problems. By contrast, those who are independent and long immersed in the markets tend to support them. The experience of encountering and coming through reversals in the markets engenders toughness and resiliency; that of being spared market swings engenders the opposite. The unremitting discipline of the markets produces and hones a strong sense of personal efficacy, where the slackness of dependency erodes it. As Friedrich Hayek notes, “independence of mind or strength of character is rarely found among those who cannot be confident that they will make their way by their own effort.”84 Without the entrepreneurs’ experience of high-stakes adaptation, the dependent tend to feel helpless. The longing of the dependent for security and succor contributed mightily to the expansion of the welfare and regulatory states. The more cushioned people are from the economic markets, the more they feel the need to be taken care of, and the more they sincerely impute similar needs in others.

The individualist ethic is a celebration of human resourcefulness and self-reliance; the social ethic is a cri de coeur from the insecure for ministration. The independent and dependent also have sharply different ways of thinking. Through constantly being pressured by the markets to consider how efficiently their firms or business units are conducting themselves as wholes, entrepreneurs develop facility at conceptualizing the overall productivity of collectivities. They understand that, if it is to fare well, society like their enterprises, must order its priorities, marshal its resources, and deal productively with the exigencies that arise. Insofar as people are shielded from the markets, they become oblivious to productivity. When problems arise on the job – trouble with the pace of workflow, reliability of inputs, or behavior of co-workers – dependent employees all too often request that higher-ups come to their aid. When challenges arise, aid recipients are even more likely to plea for others to take care of them. Absent the very notion of productivity, the protected sink into ad hoc moralism untethered by economic rationality. As spontaneously as those in business think of individual solutions to economic problems, the dependent think of government solutions. As governmental and corporate monopolies grow larger, every new protected position and welfare slot incrementally erodes the underpinnings of economic markets and strengthens those of hierarchy. Global capitalism works against the tendency of hierarchy and dependency to feed upon each other, but that tendency must ever be contended with. Economic ideas project from these fundamental leanings. The third major cause of growing government involvement in the economy from 1965 on was the chorus of support from the elite media and academia for the expansion of government. Intellectuals attacked and blamed society rather than the individual for alleged poverty, while they ignored the economic burdens and moral hazards of welfare and regulation. They did so in large part because influential journalists and scholars of the period were usually dependent employees of large media or university bureaucracies, whose own feelings of economic helplessness and vulnerability blinded them to the comprehensive societal need for economic responsibility.85 Never having run an enterprise or met a budget, they sank into narrow, idealistic, ad hoc moralism, emotionally recoiling against putative injustices, void of constraint by pragmatic concerns for societal productivity.

Why Did the Great Recession Occur? The central cause of the Great Recession was a set of regulatory failures. Like the Great Depression before it,86 the Great Recession was in large part brought on by poor management of the money supply, again by the Federal Reserve Board but this time also by the European Central Bank (ECB). As during 1930 and 1931, the money supply was allowed to drop precipitously during 2006, 2007, 2008, and even into 2009. Fed chief Ben Bernanke, an academic economist, was misled by the increasing complexity and elusiveness of money in its proliferating new forms amid rapid financial and technological innovation – as he also was by the growing unreliability of official statistics. Thus, he was led to wrongly suppose that the money supply was increasing worrisomely. Primed since the 1970s to fear inflation, Bernanke, like most generals, was fighting the last war, that of 1966-1981 against inflation, rather than the current one; and he long missed the deflationary threat to the economy. Lacking Wall Street’s attunement to the financial markets and savvy skepticism toward official numbers, Bernanke’s Fed persisted in maintaining a dangerously tight money supply during the vulnerable period leading up to and into the recession.87 More reliably than the idealistic, politicized government econometric measures, the bond markets were long signaling the absence of inflationary worries. Wise judgment based upon long experience in finance and a palpable feel for the markets are always needed as a corrective to the official numbers. The Fed’s sudden and panicky increase in banks’ capital requirements in October of 2008 from 4 to 7 percent, forcing them to halt lending, was part of its regulatory mismanagement. During the following 24 months the volume of commercial and industrial loans declined from $1.6 to $1.2 trillion. The ensuing credit crisis reverberated through the U.S. and global economies.88 The Fed’s monetary policies put severe downward pressure on the financial markets – bad monetary policy sweeps all before it. European central bankers, prominently including German bureaucrats forever reliving their country’s hyperinflation of 1923,89 shared Bernanke’s blindness and, if anything, exceeded in delusional vigor the Fed’s efforts to quell the phantom inflationary tendencies.

The Great Recession was in large part another “oops” occasion – “sorry for the mistake” – nearly eighty years after the one that misguidedly turned a recession into the Great Depression. Derivatives brought great efficiency gains to the economy, but they also brought serious side effects. The vast increases in the magnitudes of financial obligations and leveraging created by their proliferating contractual mazes have significantly increased the vulnerability of the financial system and economy, requiring attentive, appropriate regulation. An ordinary downturn is one thing, but a financial meltdown is another, far more serious occurrence greatly needing to be protected against. Early in Alan Greenspan’s chairmanship, the Fed farmed out or dropped most of its banking regulatory responsibilities.90 It made another enormous mistake early on in allowing Lehman Brothers to go under, further shaking economic confidence all over the world. Grossly deficient regulation of mortgage banking also contributed to the Great Recession. Mortgage-backed securities, large numbers of retail mortgages bundled into derivatives, greatly facilitated investors’ wholesale buying and selling of mortgages. In and of themselves they were good examples of the efficiency of the new financial vehicles, but irresponsible, predatory, and – yes – avaricious lenders, borrowers, investment banks, ratings agencies, and quasi-governmental entities subjected mortgage-backed securities to horrible abuses. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac corruptly utilized taxpayer money to lobby and strong-arm Congress into overlooking their thoroughly cynical, increasingly short-term and reckless practices. The government-sponsored behemoths knowingly underwrote the accumulation of more than a trillion dollars of dangerously leveraged obligations, guaranteeing millions of mortgages with perilously high debt-to-equity and income ratios in order to run up their own compensation and perks. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac’s lowered standards for granting loan guarantees in the housing market contributed to dangerous overextension by great numbers of naïve homeowners. Egregiously lax, interested, and corrupt oversight, ultimately by Congress, was no less reprehensible. Major investment banks’ misrepresentations of the soundness of their mortgage-backed securities were knowingly fraudulent, as were the ratings agencies’ AAA evaluations of them. The Federal Reserve Board had the power to curb these practices but did nothing, owing partly to Alan Greenspan’s selective laissez-faire blindness, partly to his deference to a changing Wall Street no longer worthy of it, and partly to his want of the courage to face down powerful interests.91 The resulting mountain of bad mortgage debt presented a financial time bomb, given the stratospheric housing-price bubble driven by the unsustainably free and deceptive mortgage money available.

Fannie Mae’s reckless misconduct from the early 1990s through the Great Recession and beyond – professedly to extend home ownership to more renters and especially those from minorities but actually for padding its executives’ compensation – played a large role in bringing about the mortgage debacle.92 Legislators and regulators jettisoned soundness because doing so was veiled by seemingly worthy surface considerations, and, well, they thought they could get away with it. Over and over again, the primary justification for the wholesale abandonment of lending standards and breaching of regulatory and industry safeguards was to increase rates of home ownership. Scoundrels of every description – Jim Johnson and his fellow Fannie Mae executives, members of Congress from both parties, Angelo Mozilo and his associates at Countrywide, duplicitous loan brokers, and many, many others whistled the same false tune. Of no concern to any of them was either the country’s distress or the massive ensuing loss of wealth in minority communities, whose modest assets and hopes were disproportionately tied up and then dashed in mortgaged home ownership. The ways in which liberal guilt and the inclusion of difference, the leitmotifs of multiculturalism, resonated disturbingly through the entire sordid real-estate bubble and collapse warrant pondering and discussion. The Basel Accords capital rules’ pushing of banks into holding mortgage-backed securities by weighting them as having low risk and sovereign debt as having no risk at all, were also extremely ill advised. These regulatory actions helped draw banks en masse into dangerously exposed debt portfolios, first in the United States and then in Europe.93 Financial dysfunctionality was allowed to build in many other forms as regulators, stock exchanges, and accounting boards ceased their vigilance against accounting gimmickry, some of it outright fraudulent. Curiously, in 2003, only two years after the Enron collapse, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) loosened the rules for reporting “off-books,” special purpose vehicles of the very sort that had brought down Enron. The failures of regulation to keep pace with economic and financial change and of regulators to competently and honestly discharge their duties were primarily responsible for the depth and severity of the Great Recession. Complacently formulaic in opposing regulation, the Bush administration tended to give its Wall Street friends what they asked for and to assume that the financial system could mostly look after itself.

As a result of the missing and bollixed regulation, immense disequilibria were allowed to build up in the economy, and once the downturn began, the threat of financial collapse arose. Why Did the European Economies Have Somewhat Different Economic Structures than the American? Most of continental Europe, unlike the United States, Britain, The Netherlands, and a few other deeply liberal countries, was predominantly authoritarian during much of the 19^(th) and early 20^(th) centuries. Its relatively recent experience of economic hierarchy and prolonged exposure to powerful hierarchical culture tended to make Europeans less entrepreneurial, more restrictive of economic markets, and more receptive to the welfare and regulatory states. Often forced to keep redundant workers on the payroll, European businesses were hesitant to hire new ones. Slow growth and high unemployment long plagued most European countries largely because of strong labor laws. Continental Europe’s different economic structures were also due in part to the fact that its countries retained stronger community and consensus than did the United States. Until the last half of the global era, much of Europe had not for many centuries experienced as large migrations and mixing of sharply diverse peoples as had the United States. Only 2 percent of Europeans lived in European countries other than that of their birth. Europeans had a great deal of time to smooth edges and harmonize sociocultural variations, unlike Americans whose country was formed more recently through large-scale movements of people and the mingling of stark differences. The resulting solidarity in Europe more easily supported curtailment of the markets and maintenance of fuller welfare states. Having stronger collectivism, social bonds, and senses of obligation among aid recipients, a well-integrated society may also be more generous with its less fortunate members. Moreover, stronger communal ties, as in Switzerland or Italy, allowed authorities to require the relatives of a needy single mother or elderly person to share in their support, lightening the burden on the state while increasing the moral pressure on the recipient to perform appropriately.95 Europe’s comparative homogeneity and workedness were successfully drawn upon in Germany to forge difficult cooperation between government, business, and labor, cooperation that would never have been possible in a context of French or American discord.

Germany brought its social programs into fiscal balance through a combination of intelligence, pragmatism, collectivism, hard work, and good will, enabling it to move early to trim the excesses of its welfare state. Nevertheless, European countries’ stronger consensuses and citizen responsibility were declining through the era, in large part due to high levels of immigration. Why the European Sovereign Debt Crisis? Like the Great Recession in the United States, Europe’s sovereign debt crisis, beginning in 2011, was primarily government caused. As in this country, pressures from special interests representing those seeking benefits and regulations were strong for expanding the welfare and regulatory states but weak for fiscal and regulatory responsibility. In Europe too the force of the leanings of the dependent was added to that of the special interests. Yet those interests and leanings could have been better managed had the incompleteness of the Maastrict Treaty of 1992 bringing the European Union into being and of the arrangements establishing the euro currency not hobbled European effectiveness. The tragedy was that monetary union could not work safely without fiscal union, but fisical union was not politically feasible. Europe’s sovereign debt crisis was ultimately caused by the idealistic hope that the continent might in due course become a democratic unity, at once strengthening Europe, expiating guilt over the Third Reich, and making the continent a moral beacon to the world. Risks were taken, reservations set aside, and realistic accounting suspended regarding the dubious finances of several eurozone members because of this hope. The Germans and other northern Europeans paid out a great deal beginning in 2011 to hold onto the euro largely because, in their good European citizenship, they overestimated the willingness of marginal, southern member-states, to fulfill their promises in the absence of firm mechanisms to enforce fiscal compliance. Given their moral resources, several weaker countries needed the possibility of depreciating their currencies to restore economic growth, but their doing so was not possible under the euro. Britain and Switzerland, with long histories of capitalism and reservoirs of financial realism and shrewdness, steered clear of the euro for just such reasons. The complex flaws of Europe’s incomplete union allowed the vast underlying contradictions of unaffordable social benefits and economic regulations to build to dangerous levels. Exposure to global economic markets required that Europe open its markets, adapt to their rigors, and cut back unsustainably generous benefits and burdensome regulations, but the euro made such tightening greatly more difficult.

Why the Liberalizing Third World Began Sustained Economic Development Only in the Global Period. A new culture of capitalism played an important role in helping regimes and societies marshal the political resolve to undergo the wrenching transition into capitalism. The economic markets enjoyed outstanding PR during the 1980s and 1990s, and still excellent PR until 2008. Some of this popularity owed to the rhetoric and appeal of Thatcher and Reagan. The media glamorized entrepreneurialism, business, technology, and the Silicon Valley for decades. Nor did the culture around capitalism cease being generally positive after the Great Recession; it became mixed. The cultural force of the markets assuaged most fear of civil disorder that had helped forestall economic liberalization in earlier societies. Sustained economic growth by less developed countries had seemed hopeless to those in developed countries during the national era (1885– 1965). Little did Westerners know at the time that much of the problem was theirs. Under Harold Laski’s influence, a generation of third-world leaders was educated at the London School of Economics (LSE) during the mid- 20^(th) century, in top-down socialist planning not so different from the traditional hierarchical pattern they needed to overcome. Development specialists worked against the markets, recommending and sometimes building huge steel plants in India or grand infrastructure projects in Ghana that seldom had the hoped-for impact. Transition of third-world societies directly into national capitalist structures simply did not occur. Where approximately eight European authoritarian societies and four former European colonies had been able to climb to modernity during the early liberal period (1500-1885),96 not one authoritarian society was able to do so during the national era, at least not on its own, that is, without going to war against the very idea of modernity and suffering military defeat at the hands of well-disposed opponents. Under Nehru and the Gandhis, India’s post-independence Congress Party bought into the inappropriate Laski model. In an atmosphere of complacency and self-satisfaction, it long flirted with socialism and the Soviets, while going nowhere economically. No single university had the kind of policy dominance during the global era that LSE had at mid-century, but aspiring third-world leaders tended to shift during the global era to universities in the more market-friendly United States. The most economically influential American institution of higher learning for the third world has been the University of Chicago, dominated by the free-market approach of Milton Friedman and his followers.

What actually worked in the third world – opening up the economic markets – was quite different from the self-defeating statism that national-era development specialists and intellectuals touted. The transition of third-world countries directly into capitalism simply did not occur before the global-capitalist period because such a transition for a third-world country, without market-induced incentives and enterprise, was something like asking a person to climb from the peasantry directly into the upper-middle class, skipping the working and middle classes altogether. From Nehru to Nasser, many third-world leaders got nowhere fast. Laski offered a wobbly ladder missing its lower-middle rungs; it took middle-class self-control for granted. Friedman’s ladder was secure, though unappealing to the genteel, because it went from the ground floor up, providing for third-world people’s development of middle-class alertness and discipline along the way. New technologies and adaptations developed in the first world tended to diffuse through much of the world due to advances in the technologies of transportation and communication. That much of the best management, accounting, technology, law, and finance quickly went global was free transfer of the productivity of the most developed economies to the ambitious newcomers, contributing mightily to their strong economic growth and unprecedented development. Much of this intellectual capital was not proprietary, but a good deal of it was pirated. Advances in technology also made possible the elimination of a longstanding source of third-world resistance to the markets in their earlier contentment with the customary. It did so by providing the means to supplant traditional wants. Much of the third world adopted the economic markets and began sustained growth in part as a cumulative effect of capitalism’s ubiquitous advertising, marketing, and merchandizing that created high demand for consumer products. As third-world peoples were flooded with material images via the media, new desires drew them into the cash economy and consumerist whirl. Once transitions to capitalism were effected, rates of economic growth were higher in third-world countries than in first-world ones partly because they started at the bottom and had so much room to improve. Their peoples were determined to save and accumulate without delay and were unwilling to support costly government programs. The drive behind their herculean efforts to quickly rise allowed the burdens of the welfare and regulatory states to remain relatively light.

The rule of law progressed in most third-world countries during the global era, contributing to the spread of capitalism – but not as strongly as it might have. Those in privileged industries and professions with protection against the markets frequently resisted the rule of law, taking advantage of arcane practices from the hierarchical past to engage in rear-guard action opposing the clarification of ownership, for example.97 Supporters of hierarchic backwardness exploited legal and bureaucratic opacity for every advantage. The third world long had a good deal of property, but this property was held in opaque, collectivist forms unsuitable for promoting exchange, such as houses built on land whose ownership rights were not adequately recorded or unincorporated businesses with undefined liability. Since the rights to such possessions were not adequately documented, these assets could not readily be turned into capital, could not be traded outside of narrow local circles where people knew and trusted each other, and could not be used as collateral.98 There was “too much room for misunderstanding, faulty recollection and reversal of agreement.”99 As property law takes hold, it “fixes and realizes capital,” making certainty possible regarding the ownership and transfer of resources.100 Property rights were clarified only with difficulty. Such structural differences between firstand third-world capitalist economies also resulted from the fact that the latter had little or no experience with open capitalist economic markets. The waves of extra-legal migrants in the third world who squatted on underutilized land, traded where forbidden, and clashed with authorities enforcing the old, conflicted property rights constituted a major force for legal and economic renewal. Those moving into the extra-legal barrios and favelas of the third world were the analogs of the peasants who migrated illegally into the free, prospering cities of the Middle Ages, building early capitalism in Europe.101 To the extent to which modern property law was adopted, it lowered transaction costs, enhanced calculability, and reduced cronyism.102 Why the Precariousness of the Era’s Hierarchical Economies? Many of the period’s authoritarian holdouts and backsliders against global capitalism were oil-producing countries. Despite the Middle East’s long history of trade and some cultural support for the markets, many of its economies, such as those of Saudi Arabia, Iran, and Bahrain, remained predominantly hierarchical because authoritarian rulers retained control of their countries’ petro-chemical resources.

Russia was in a similar situation. Rulers’ possession of large oil supplies has an effect similar to that conferred by aristocratic control of the land in traditional hierarchical societies. So long as rulers’ oil and natural gas revenues continued to flow, true capitalism had little chance except subordinately and precariously. However, energy technology was developing rapidly by the end of the era, oil markets were extremely volatile, and power based upon petroleum reserves was becoming less secure. China, with its dominant hierarchical economic sector and market-based secondary tier, sought to reap the economic benefits of capitalism while engaging in mercantilist, top down development and suppressing personal freedom. That profile conferred advantages in the short and middle runs, but it introduced colossal distortions and vulnerabilities in the long run. As China’s economic markets intensify and a progressively larger, more capable, and more independent middle class arises, the regime’s political monopoly will come under greater challenge. Insofar as economic and political controls are truculently intensified, the economic distortions will intensify and further jeopardize competitiveness. The Chinese economy became the world’s second largest by the end of the era, but it was also vulnerable. This was evident in the continuing incompleteness of its rule of law. As James Fallows succinctly puts it, “in China … law is one thing and reality is another.”103 The vulnerability of the Chinese economy was also evident in its massive debt and real estate bubbles tainted with corruption. The regime could run through its extensive foreign currency reserves rather quickly if those bubbles pop. Twelve hundred years after their humble beginnings during the early Middle Ages in Venice, Milan, Bari, and Amalfi and fifty-five after the end of the 20th century, and the world had become predominantly capitalist. From Canada to Brazil, Norway to Indonesia, and Japan to Nigeria, integrated world markets delivered oil, cotton, computers, automobiles, jet planes, software, and money at whatever prices and quantities supply and demand would bear. Strewn by the wayside was the wreckage of the brutal tyrants, imperious officials, conspiring revolutionaries, starry-eyed utopians, and faint-hearted do-gooders who had sold short in the prolonged bull market. As capitalism had long brought extraordinary benefits to the first world, it was now also bringing them to the third world.

Capitalism’s unsurpassed economic and technological productivity enabled market societies to defend themselves against the authoritarian murderers and thugs who forever seek to impose their wills by force upon their peaceful neighbors. The global markets lifted several billion human beings out of poverty and well over a billion into middle incomes around the world. They generated the means with which to educate as never before. To the extent to which third-world countries resolved to achieve growth, capitalism catapulted them toward first-world development and living standards. Global capitalism did not lock third-world countries into traps as peripheral suppliers of primary products – it released them from those traps. Whether the initial thrust was from textiles, bananas, copper, manganese, lumber, tourism, or anything else; where the global markets were accepted, prosperity and diversification followed. Socialism, not capitalism, locked third-world countries into the periphery.104 The lifting of the third world toward the productivity and living standards of the first at the same time represented a tremendous global economic equalization. As the third world grew at a faster clip than the first from 1987 and steeply so from 2007, inequality between countries decreased as considerable catching up went on globally. The 70-fold gulf between first- and third-world incomes of the late 1980s and early 1990s declined to a 42-fold gap by 2013.105 Much of that convergence, soberingly, was a function of slow growth in the first world during and after the Great Recession. First-world citizens had no one but themselves to blame for the slide in growth rates from 2008 that was responsible for many of their complaints about globalization. Yet income inequality within the United States increased during the global era to the highest levels it had reached since the early 20th century, more than in most other global-liberal societies. Real income rose considerably at the top in this country, stagnated for most others, and declined for those at the bottom. Some of that inequality occurred because as the third-world poor entered first-world countries and lived side-by-side with developed populations, inequality came closer and became more visible, the flip side of inclusion. The apparent increase in inequality from this source was only a matter of where it was located; it was perspectival. Some of it was also measurement error from federal income figures not including government benefits or unreported income. Nevertheless, the trend was real and concerning.

Yet, as becomes apparent in the chapters to come, increased inequality of power was even more pronounced and more worrisome, not only suggesting that further increases of economic inequality may lie ahead but raising acute concerns about the political, social, and moral ramifications of that inequality of power. Economic inequality rose in this country and others in part because as the economic arena became global, stupendous fortunes were to be made, for the larger the economic markets, the larger the disparities, all else equal. Such inequality in the United States and other global-liberal societies rose because of intense international competition in which third-world competitors relying on cheap labor were undercutting many first-world businesses. They were more successful in taking away working-class employment and less so in taking away middle- and upper-middle-class employment, but they were moving up the food chain, taking away progressively better jobs. An additional reason for the increased economic inequality of the era is treated in chapter 4. The prospering of the third world should be recognized as a global equalization in part offsetting the harmful contribution of the larger scale of global markets to inequality. Since much of the increased economic inequality in the United States was in effect a provincial complaint about a larger process of globalization which was egalitarian in many respects, one would think that Americans, whose country played the decisive role in fostering the global markets, ought to be able to handle the relatively modest adjustments required of them. Some perspective should be kept regarding relative income slippages of a few percentage points here and there when so many in the United States and around the world have greatly benefited from the global markets. Cheating on the rules of international trade is another matter. Undeniably, the economic markets, like any others, are inseparable from Schumpeterian destruction as well as creation.106 Wherever there are sunrise forms, there are also sunset forms: As new businesses, industries, technologies, and skills rise, old ones decline. Capitalism is a positive-sum game, but the markets inevitably require many adjustments that are accompanied by hardship. The pain they inflict is sufficiently difficult to accept when it strikes close to home that the economic markets have few permanent friends, even among their avid supporters. Nor are capitalism’s challenges only economic, for when the markets are as extremely powerful as they became during the global era, they also skew priorities. Tocqueville spoke insightfully of “that craving for material well-being which leads the way to slavery.”107 During the national era much book publishing, for example, was relatively dedicated and self-sacrificing.

Publishers, whose companies were frequently medium sized and independent, often truly believed in what they were doing and selected books on the basis of their lasting literary or intellectual value, in effect subsidizing high-quality writing. Bennett Cerf was one of those fine publishers. Under global capitalism, most publishing by far became concentrated in the hands of a few large corporations for whom the earlier commitment was replaced by the bottom line. Things were little different in the media or business generally. The market economy so imperialized American society and culture that they substantially became the incidental outcomes of powerful corporations’ needs to maintain profitability. Global capitalism played an important role in the large moral vacuum that formed around it. Nevertheless, countries could not avoid the economic markets without inviting vastly more trouble than any attending capitalism. Down the anti-market road lay closing themselves off from the rest of the world, languishing economically, and inviting tyrants domestic or foreign to run them into the ground. The growing economic inequality of the last half century in the United States posed a major problem for the country, but that problem primarily had other sources than economic ones. Above all, it had political, social, moral, and cultural sources. Since every social institution and aspect of personality has interacted with global capitalism, it is best to keep assessments of the global economic markets somewhat provisional until the wider circumstances have been examined. To commence this fuller analysis let us turn to the ways in which the United States began coming apart in 1965, beginning with how large numbers of Americans ceased identifying with their country. he breadth of Americans’ identification narrowed during the late 1960s and early 1970s as attachment was redirected from the nation to racial, ethnic, gender, and lifestyle groups; not in everyone, but in enough that it firmed into a tacit consensus. Increased concern with the group went hand-in-hand with heightened sensitivity toward how society treated it and diminished concern with how it treated society. The United States was one of the earliest countries to make the transition, but many others went through it as well, including all in the West. This highly charged narrowing of attachment was as central to the global-liberal paradigm and era as was the opening of the many-sided markets, and it had profound consequences.

This highly charged narrowing of attachment was as central to the global-liberal paradigm and era as was the opening of the many-sided markets, and it had profound consequences. As identification shifted from the nation to the group, racial conflict began increasing during the civil-rights movement in which African Americans employed Gandhian language and tactics of nonviolence from the Indian independence movement to reject their second-class status and gain legal rights. The conflict sharply intensified with the Watts riot of 1965 and subsequent ghetto riots as the civil-rights movement abruptly metamorphosed into a movement of black power that expressed disaffection and pursued tangible and intangible benefits. Group restiveness increased in other countries and along other lines, partly spread from the United States to racial and ethnic groups abroad and partly spread to gender and lifestyle groups in this country and elsewhere. After an era of relative quiescence, racial and ethnic antagonism flared in Northern Ireland, Quebec, Spain, and Belgium. Blacks began militantly opposing white domination in Rhodesia and South Africa, Tamils began increasingly contesting Sinhalese domination in Sri Lanka, and Slovenes, Croatians, Muslims, and others began systematically opposing Serbian domination in Yugoslavia. Factious sentiments held by a swirl of hostile and mutually suspicious ethnic groups in Eastern Europe and Central Asia helped strip the Soviet Union down to its Russian nucleus. The increased salience of the group and decreased salience of the nation were central to these conflicts. The single most shocking and horrifying event of the twentieth cenforlorn by the Third Reich’s systematic slaughter of more than 6 million Jews. No ordinary word even sufficed to name the heinous event, and a new usage came into the language: Holocaust as a burnt offering in reference to an entire people in genocide. The anguish was particularly acute for survivors, who, traumatized by what had happened, resolved never to forget. Amid their profound sorrow, it stuck poignantly in their memories that, in all too many cases, when European Jews desperately needed refuge and flight was still possible, no country in the world had been willing to take them in. The Holocaust helped set the stage for global liberalism’s preoccupation with groups. The global-liberal focus on groups was anticipated and given impetus during the postwar decades as diffuse feelings of guilt and sympathy arose in thoughtful people regarding prejudice and discrimination. The combat participation of black soldiers in World War II (in segregated units) and labor of black workers side-by-side with white ones on the home front led to increased disquiet about racism and early support for civil rights.

A growing and increasingly impassioned movement against racism and anti-Semitism began gaining momentum. Against this background, President Truman desegregated the U.S. military by executive order in 1948, to favorable reception in much of the country. The U.S. Supreme Court mandated public school desegregation in 1954 in its famous Brown versus Board of Education decision. By the postwar years, as Lemann says, “Race relations stood out nearly everywhere as the one thing most plainly wrong in America….”108 The civil-rights movement began in 1955 with the Montgomery bus boycott and raged on in lunch-counter sit-ins, boycotts, and protests over the following decade. From its onset, the movement was closely intertwined with action by the federal government, especially the judicial but also the executive and legislative branches.109 As increasingly large and effective protests produced gains of consciousness in the South and throughout the country, a critical juncture arrived when President Kennedy was elected. An eloquent speaker, he helped persuade much of the When Kennedy was assassinated in November of that year, the nation’s grief at the loss of its inspiring young leader was followed by a desire to live up to his high ideals. In the eyes of many, he became a martyr to the causes of inclusion and tolerance that he had nobly espoused. The civil-rights bill, long mired in southern opposition, swiftly became law in early 1964 as a monument to the dead leader and main crescendo of the civil-rights movement. It was testimony as well to President Johnson’s parliamentary genius.110 Police brutality against peaceful protestors the following year in Selma, Alabama outraged Americans across the country and strengthened the national resolve to set things right. The Civil Rights Act of 1964 and Voting Rights Act of 1965 removed most remaining legal defenses of racial and ethnic discrimination in the United States. By the time of their passage most Americans accepted national responsibility for working toward overcoming racial and ethnic injustice, directing resources toward easing conditions for minorities, and strengthening norms and virtues toward overcoming prejudice and discrimination. Almost as an aside amid surging respect for all peoples, the Immigration and Nationality Act passed against little opposition in 1965, opening U.S. borders that had been nearly closed by restrictive law since 1924.

Levels of legal and eventually illegal immigration were also allowed to rise steeply. Although a relatively diverse society from its origins, the United States had possessed a national consensus in support of broad social unity from the country’s origins through the early 1960s, except for the Civil War period; a consensus that had strengthened during the national era. That consensus carried moral force and charisma which drew large numbers of its citizens together, although it also left some out. It was presided over by the WASPS (White, Anglo-Saxon Protestants), the upper-, upper-middle-, and middle-class versions of whose culture were the esteemed norms through the national era. With varying degrees of ambivalence, many who were different, among them Catholics, Jews, blacks, Hispanics, and Asians, had accepted that consensus, paid respect to it, aspired to blend into it, and raised their children to do the same. The national-liberal paradigm and era held through the August 6, 1965 passage of the Voting Rights Act, the second civil rights law. The national era ended and the global era began with the Watts riot th on a hinge” during the summer of 1965, Nicholas Lemann says; the huge ghetto riot “instantly convinced the whole country that there was a severe crisis in the black slums.”111 The national era with its overriding sense of the country’s unity ended, and the global era with its sense of disunity was under way. The focus turned from the nation to the group.112 The multiculturalism foundational to the global-liberal paradigm and era is the ideology of identity politics based upon the assumption that society is a set of racial, ethnic, gender, and lifestyle groups rather than a national unit. It holds that the focus should be upon the alienated, unjustly treated groups among them rather than upon the larger society. Multiculturalism values the designated victim groups and disvalues the dominant majority. It assigns the moral high ground to the groups and the low ground to whites, Anglos, gentiles, men, and heterosexuals. Multiculturalism encourages difference and discourages assimilation. It blames and disparages the once celebrated larger society by associating it with the discredited white majority that had dominated in the past. It opposes attempts to strengthen or benefit society as a whole, both because it takes that notion to be meaningless and because its adherents feel allegiance to the groups rather than to society.

Its globalism lies in its opposition to nations and support for international entities like the EU and UN that weaken them. Among its more remarkable effects, the multiculturalist framework transformed the national era social ethic of helping those who needed it on universal grounds, into the global era ethic of helping those who needed it as members of particular groups.113 Émile Durkheim classifies societies structured by particularistic emphasis upon groups as blocks in such a manner, like imperial Austro-Hungary, the USSR, traditional India, or the Middle East, as segmentary rather than unitary.114 The multiculturalists’ most explosive accusation against the earlier American order was of racism, that the country had acceded to slavery until the Civil War, tolerated Jim Crow (the Southern regime of segregation) from the Civil War through the early 1960s, and permitted major discriminatory economic, legal, social, and educational practices after that. Shocking television clips of police violence against innocent protestors in an ostensibly free society deeply affected Americans and others around the world, sparking solidarity among and with group members and prompting widespread outrage that helped institute the reign of multiculturalism. News coverage of protestors’ persuasive messages and heroic stands also marshaled support. As Americans came under the influence of multiculturalist action and rhetoric in the mid-1960s, deep discontent and rebelliousness swept over blacks – and, soon after, young people, Hispanics, women, and gays. The riots accelerated the tendency, as did the assassination of Martin Luther King. As multiculturalist blame took hold and began generalizing, group identity was inflamed and national identity subdued. The members of multiple groups were becoming collectively self-conscious and demanding with great ethical force more respect and rights than they had been receiving. The perception was building in the American public of the contradiction between the nation’s central values and the systematic exclusion and mistreatment of blacks and other groups. Most also came to feel that societal peace required understanding the groups’ circumstances and accommodating their reasonable demands. Among their targets, the multiculturalists and those allied with them mounted a withering critique of the American WASP establishment of the previous era that had permitted collective injustice to occur. Slammed with charges of racism, the old establishment’s genial WASPs substantially capitulated. The horrors of violence against and mistreatment of blacks, Jews, Hispanics, women, gays, and members of other groups were the foundational memories that seared themselves into the mentalities of a generation, an era, and much of the world during the transition into global liberalism.

The theme of negating the intolerant majority and struggling on behalf of the victim minority dominated the social imagination of the era. Its central domestic policy concern became seeking to define and redress sociocultural conditions as manifesting collective injustice. A tacit consensus came to support some but not all of the basic assumptions of multiculturalism. The consensual core was that the country had to try its best to overcome prejudice and discrimination against blacks, Jews, Hispanics, Asians, women, and gays; in the society, culture, and law. That consensus did not extend to the movement’s attempts to go beyond equal rights toward equal outcomes. Many such attempts were intensely opposed though others sometimes obtained majorities. Forced busing was extremely contentious locally around the country, often flaring into violence and disruption, as in south Boston, but it never emerged as a major political issue nationally because it was imposed by the courts. Affirmative action too was widely opposed, but nor could that issue ever scale politically because judicially imposed. The public was willing to accept moderate political correctness with its norms protecting group members from communication or action that might give offense. Well before that rubric appeared, a consensus quickly and happily banned the offensive epithets referring to group members that had been in wide currency through the early 1960s, but there was little and vague consensus regarding political correctness beyond this initial case except in strongly liberal settings. Highly charged from the onset, multiculturalism was accompanied by bitter struggles and a great deal of rancor. Many of the combatants were conflictualist, i.e., they considered conflict to be the normal state of affairs and broadly embraced and justified it.115 Jean-Francois Lyotard, for one, urged people to take the offensive and struggle socioculturally. His first principle was, “To speak is to fight.”116 The contestation became compulsive and polarization the order of the day, with positions dug in and fortified. In a country that had long been accustomed to relative harmony, multiculturalism spawned continuing conflict when regularly going beyond its limited supporting consensus. The change brought by half a century of multiculturalism was immensely consequential, but it was subtle. Most Americans were only partially aware of how deeply multiculturalism was changing the country although they were apprehensive about it.

What was discredited across the Atlantic was above all anything associated with fascism. Early in the global era thoroughly anti-fascist, anti-colonial young, white radicals and their allies rather than aggrieved groups became ascendant in Europe. In an atmosphere of moral outrage and blame, the younger generation and its older sympathizers demanded that militarism and imperialism be halted, access to university education broadened, and the personal freedom extended with which to live their lives as they would. Except where it concerned regional sovereignty – as with Basques in Spain, Irish in Ulster, and Walloons in Belgium – Europeans were relatively unconcerned with minority relations for a quarter-century longer than were Americans, at least on the surface. Many European countries had guest-worker programs, but they retained strict immigration controls through most of the 1980s. Near the end of the Cold War, immigration laws were relaxed and many guest workers were permitted to remain in their host countries. Following the collapse of the Soviet Union, immigration from Eastern Europe increased dramatically and became the focus for a time. When rejection of the West became more apparent in Muslim minorities after 9/11, Europe began paying more attention to the problems they posed. Immigration policies tightened during the 2000s but loosened again before long. Muslim immigration accelerated sharply as Syrian refugees began flooding into Europe in 2013, with more than a million arriving in 2015 alone. The Muslim populations of major Western European countries, including the United Kingdom, reached 5 to 8 percent by the end of the era, with France at the top of the list. Europe had long had large variations among Christian and secular sociocultural patterns and harmonized them reasonably well; only from the 1990s did it encounter difference comparable to that in the United States, Canada, and Brazil.117 Europe’s new diversity was troubling because to a disconcerting degree its Muslim population formed a large, resistant bloc withholding allegiance from the deepest principles of its host countries. Some Muslim Europeans were practicing jihad in the radical sense of violent opposition to what is not Islamic and were mounting continual terrorist attacks against their Western hosts by the summer of 2016, but large numbers of Muslim Europeans were also profoundly dissenting in other ways.

As Ayaan Hirsi Ali says, “We were taught that, as Muslims, we should oppose the West.”118 France, Belgium, Sweden, and other countries foundered in their response, allowing the formation of semi-sovereign banlieues or suburbs, ghettoes that authorities all but abandoned to Islamists, criminals, and shari’a law. Europe’s Muslim uprising was frequently accompanied by an informal underground movement having some of the characteristics of organized crime, notably in the way in which it widely coerced its members and particularly women into resisting Western ways. Ali gives numerous examples evincing European multiculturalists’ denial about and co-dependency regarding this coercion.119 India, one of the most heterogeneous societies in the world, inherited deeply entrenched sociocultural segmentation in its caste system. Although it achieved much of great value under Nehru, the country lost a fine chance to establish universal, caste-blind principles constitutionally and instead ratified many sorts of group rights.120 In 1989 a Congress-Party-dominated coalition government instituted major affirmative-action set-asides of government jobs and higher education admissions for those of lower castes.121 In 2011 Prime Minister Manmohan Singh’s Congress Party government extended those set-asides to almost 50 percent of available positions. Affirmative action had the negative side effects of both reviving the caste system and promoting resentment between castes.122 Tensions between India’s 80 percent Hindu majority and 13 percent Muslim minority also increased somewhat from the early 1990s, thanks to the Islamic Resurgence, provocations by the Pakistani regime, and, reactively, intolerance by the Hindu-nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). Like its affirmative action programs, India’s partial recognition of Muslim communal shari’a law was multiculturalist. Japan, in contrast to the West and India, had comparatively little diversity, sought to avoid increasing what it had, and refused multiculturalism, resolutely continuing to honor its homogeneous nation, society, culture, and history throughout the era. While not aggressive toward any country or group, it denied atrocities committed during World War II and avoided the topic of its small Korean and Ainu minorities. Japan had become an outstanding democratic country with its own rich and worthy tradition and values, and it was a vital ally of the United States. The alarming disjoint of the global era was between liberal societies’ respect for and solicitude toward others domestically and internationally amid the overcoming of injustice, and hierarchical societies’ fundamental disrespect for others amid deliberate perpetration of injustice.

The West, India, and their friends around the world were respectful of others while China, Russia, and most Muslim countries pointedly were not. Huntington’s “fault-line” conflicts between civilizations emanated overwhelmingly from authoritarian rather than liberal societies, from tyrannical ruling classes that grind their people and their neighbors into the ground as they are able to, in part through aggressive nationalism.123 In place of respecting difference, the Chinese regime, for example, filled prisons with political dissenters and extensively employed the death penalty against harmless Christians and Falun Gong. Putin and the FRS (Russia’s secret police) consolidated their regime by bombing apartment buildings and killing hundreds of innocent Russians in order to scurrilously blame Chechnyan separatists and scapegoat and suppress them with wanton violence to rally naïve Russians behind the reassertion of tyranny.124 Without usually being as coldly efficient, Muslim tyrants were every bit as ruthless. Far from embracing difference, authoritarian societies suppressed and exploited it. Multiculturalism in the United States arose out of the experience and leanings of minorities, especially Jewish and black Americans, dice they had suffered individually and collectively and sometimes continued to suffer. Modern Jewish sympathies, particularly after the Holocaust, focused strongly on and embraced unjustly treated groups. Having long experienced victimhood associated with their difference, the same was true for blacks. Both remained collectively self-conscious, within but to some extent apart from and resistant to the larger American society.125 Multiculturalism struck a special chord as well among the members of other racial and ethnic groups and, subsequently, those of gender and lifestyle groups. Hispanics, Asians, the LGBT community, and to some extent women had sufficiently distinct experience and circumstances that difference was relatively salient for them. Ascending group sensitivities began shifting the focus toward race and ethnicity during the postwar years but did so decisively during the mid-1960s and helped keep it there for more than half a century. Young people were part of the original multiculturalist coalition as a distinct group, but their group-conciouness dissolved as the War in Vietnam and the draft wound down, they grew older, and the youth movement was discredited. As multiculturalism took hold, group identity increased and alienation intensified. The comparatively homogeneous circumstances and Christian traditions of most Americans instead had affinities to unitary identities and perspectives.

They allowed it considerable leeway in the interests of social reconciliation despite its radicalism, splintering, and conflictualism that went against their Christian grains of reconciliation. The pall of socially constructed guilt long held the accused at bay. From early on the groups found receptive ears and crucial support from growing numbers of white liberal sympathizers especially numerous and influential in the upper and upper-middle classes. Much of their influence emanated from their lopsided domination of the courts, the media, and higher education. As historian Richard Abrams says of the 1950s, early 1960s, and first decade of the new era, most of the major progressive changes of the time in United States were instituted by a well-intentioned “liberal elite fortuitously entrenched in key social, political, and especially judicial positions.”126 As the ground shook beneath them with the emergence of the new upper class to which we turn in the next chapter, ordinary Americans’ background of earnest but sheltered Christian middle-class tradition little prepared them for the assault of multiculturalism. The central pivot upon which the global-liberal paradigm and era turned was the multiculturalist blame of the United States, its heritage, and those who supported them. The talent, resources, and strong leanings of the groups and their powerful allies prevailed over traditional America. The ghetto riots may have damaged more black than white property, but they did effectively manipulate white guilt. Those uprisings morally discredited the country and its heritage while banking large reservoirs of guilt, conferring power upon the previously excluded and their allies. Their massive, one-sided culture war and PR campaign blaming and discrediting the United States, the West, and their traditions were decisive against the good will, educational limitations, and inexperience with cultural markets of average white Americans. The alienated groups and their upper- and upper-middle-class allies’ forceful snapping at all who failed to agree helped enforce their consensus through the period. Together they became dominant in many ways during the global era. The national-liberal paradigm had buckled under their combined weight, making way for the new one. Multiculturalism’s discreditation of the country brought a cascade of harmful consequences, beginning with its impact upon black Americans.

President Johnson conveyed the heart of the argument: “You do not take a person who for years has been hobbled by chains and liberate him, bring him up to the starting line in a race and then say, ‘You are free to compete with all the others.’”127 Multiculturalist blame absolved black Americans of responsibility for their condition in life. Shelby Steele sees multiculturalism’s tarnishing of the country and its history as having tabooed application to black Americans of the very principle that had animated the American economic, political, and moral achievement, that of people taking individual responsibility for their lives. Why try, if the deck was supposedly stacked against you? Why bother if others were to blame? It became verboten under multiculturalism to ask that black Americans take responsibility for their lives like others. In place of the power of taking responsibility, they acquired “the power to shame, silence, and muscle concessions from the larger society on the basis of past victimization.”128 To Steele, “White guilt led black Americans to a great mistake: to talk themselves out of the individual freedom we had just won for no purpose whatsoever except to trigger white obligation.”129 As he sees it, our most basic power lies in our taking of full responsibility; no one benefits from the help of others without doing so.130 Another major consequence of multiculturalism is that, under it, Washington was conveniently marketed as the neutral arbiter and righter of past wrongs as agency was reallocated from individual persons to the federal government. It reinforced that allocation of the central role to the government by striving throughout the period to define justice as equal outcomes rather than equal rights to work hard and compete. At the same time, it sought to attribute group differences in performance or achievement to discrimination. Both stances helped cement the relationship between multiculturalism and growing government. As one of the founders of multiculturalism, Johnson knew what he was doing. The era was unusually contentious in large part because the struggles for collective recognition and justice central to the experience of societies under multiculturalism involved matters about which people feel intensely, their very identities. Identity politics is inherently charged, tribal, and a negative-sum game. Its intense passions tend to banish reason and reconciliation.

The resistance in Europe from the late 1980s occurred in part because the Muslim world accepted a virulent, anti-Western paradigm with the onset of the Islamic Resurgence. Turning away from domestic questioning and reform, large numbers of Muslims blamed their discontents on Israel, the West, or other Muslim sects. No less responsible for the resistance in Europe was its ineffectual response to the same. That response in turn owed largely to its belatedly coming under the influence of multiculturalism at the end of the 1980s, which led to evasively interpreting the threats posed by Muslim immigrants and their offspring as humanitarian concerns or group rights, rather than as the continuation of 1400 years of Muslim invasion by other means. The ineffectuality centered on the way in which multiculturalism played upon Europeans’ sense of guilt over fascist atrocities. Amid declining leadership, some of the region’s ineffectuality also arose from the organizational morass of being stranded between a fully operational, democratic EU and the autonomous nation-states of the past. Generational change was extremely important in Europe as it was in the United States. As the World War II generation receded, the toughness, realism, and balance with which to refuse entry to those difficult to integrate also receded. Willy Brandt and Helmut Schmidt could manage it; Gerhard Schroeder and Angela Merkel could not. Like the Pax Americana and global capitalism, multiculturalism had deep and pervasive effects upon the societies under its sway as the focus of identification and attachment always does. However necessary it was that the United States return to the problem of race during the global era, its doing so under multiculturalism carried a steep price, for the doctrine’s accusations of grievous collective injustice against the country, its founding fathers, and its entire national heritage initiated a reverberating series of negative consequences that we shall see in multiple additional ways in which this country and the West began disintegrating during the global era. Multiculturalism represented the fundamental coming apart that drove the multiple other comings apart. After taking a growing toll through its 51-year reign, multiculturalism itself became one of two fundamental issues most in contention by the end of the global era, both in the United States and in Europe. The next chapter introduces, describes, and analyzes the global era’s new upper class of gamers that posed the other of those most contested issues.

Their character-based ways of perceiving, thinking, feeling, and acting were stamped all over the society and history of our time. The most successful executives and professionals dominating all institutions were gamers. The proto-gamers of the 1960s and the full-fledged ones of the 1970s largely displaced the WASP upper class and the paradigm it bore, although that leading class and paradigm continued to moderate the gamers until the early 1990s. As Heraclitus says, “Character … is destiny.”133 The central role played by the gamers in the United States has been among the less understood aspects of all that has occurred since 1965. Essential to the gamers is that they possess not only the basic rational self- consciousness and self-control of the middle-class superego but higher-level versions of the same, with which they control the elementary versions. Instead of feeling bound by rules, they flexibly use, modify, or discard them to further their individual goals.134 Unlike the merchants and shopkeepers of early modernity who held inner rules rigidly or the white-collar workers of the national era who held them while attuned to others’ expectations, the gamers are self-directed but accept no binding rules. By “higher” self-control, I mean self-determination that is one layer more reflexive or aware in certain respects; not that it is more worthy or more advanced, all things considered. The gamers’ stock-in-trade is provisional, pragmatic policies that further their interests. Utterly immersed in and adapted to markets of all kinds, the gamers analyze everything and hold everything to be up for grabs. Committed to no particulars, they cannot be easily flustered; but nor are they grounded or anchored. The gamers arose early in the global period as higher-level, rational self-understanding and self-management became dominant in the character of many of the most able, especially among those entering business and the professions. They began habitually employing their higher self-control to game their careers and fast-forward their ascents. Utterly directed toward excelling at the game, they are highly adept at all things connected with their personal advancement.

They began habitually employing their higher self-control to game their careers and fast-forward their ascents. Utterly directed toward excelling at the game, they are highly adept at all things connected with their personal advancement. Systematically pursuing their rational interests as they understand them, the gamers deftly adjust and fine-tune their performance at school and at work, discipline and position themselves to get into great colleges and universities, maneuver their way into valuable internships, and garner outstanding early jobs. Intensely competitive and savvy, gamers think and talk incessantly about job and investment opportunities throughout their careers. The dexterity of their educational and career moves is one of the keys to their success. Another key is that they hone their job performances to virtuosity. Highly capable and building upon impressive education and early experience, they specialize, work extremely long hours, and develop formidable repertoires of knowledge and skill. In time they become supremely proficient at what they do. Gamer executives adroitly vary management theories, marketing strategies, and corporate cultures. Those in marketing, advertising, and communications agilely and cleverly use media and public relations to their advantage. Gamer tax attorneys and accountants ingeniously interpret subtleties of law and accounting to solve clients’ problems and build their practices. Drawing upon sophisticated understanding and remarkable entrepreneurialism, gamer executives evince a creative adaptability far greater and more astonishing than any the middle class has known. There have always been unusual business opportunities in liberal societies, but never before have such astonishing skills been available with which to exploit them. Gamer drive pushes forward much more intensely and unremittingly than did middle-class discipline in its heyday, leading to far greater personal income and wealth. So single-mindedly rational and instrumentalist are the gamers that everything largely becomes a matter of economics to them. As they subject themselves to a higher inner despotism, even their manner of speech with its long and short bursts of rapid, mechanical utterance betrays the severity of their striving. Global-era management was no longer the low-key, jovial, secure experience it often was at mid-century. Weber judged middle-class discipline, as primed by the Protestant ethic and spirit of capitalism, to have been the engine of the West’s unparalleled development during the centuries of early capitalism.135 In its economic aspects, the character of the gamers was the advanced engine of development helping drive the much more rapid economic growth of the entire world during the global era, but in its non-economic aspects, that character posed major problems, even for growth. Whether venture capitalists, politicians, scholars, or intelligence analysts, the inquiry toward which gamers lean is technical, reflecting their intense instrumentalism.

Whether venture capitalists, politicians, scholars, or intelligence analysts, the inquiry toward which gamers lean is technical, reflecting their intense instrumentalism. The gamers may know a lot, but they tend to know things narrowly and calculatedly rather than comprehensively and intuitively. Their eschewing of the big picture and over-reliance on formal models and under-processed data are among the reasons it is hard to get elected officials to think beyond their polling numbers. The gamers’ penchant for losing themselves in technical detail is partly responsible for the great American intelligence fiascos of recent decades, such as failing to see 9/11 coming. A prime example of gamer one-sidedness is the character of Mark Zuckerberg as fictionally portrayed in the film The Social Network.136 Mitt Romney’s brilliance and his uneven sensitivity are quintessentially gamer. However gifted, knowledgeable, and proficient the gamers, their one-sidedness renders them particularly vulnerable to being outflanked by the complexity and elusiveness of human nature. Realists through and through, the gamers tend to be interested in comparatively little in and of itself – they want results. In their driving ambition, they cashiered the well-intentioned but often loopy idealism of the 1960s for striving. Avoiding and even disparaging the ideal, the gamers appreciate higher education overwhelmingly for the doors it opens and the fungible adaptability, credentials, and connections it bestows, not for its humanistic value. More than most human beings, the gamers project their own mentality onto the actions of others, as in the way they impute everywhere the cynical realism that pervades their thinking. More individualist in most respects than the early bourgeois and vastly more so than the company men of the 1950s, the gamers take to competition with a relish. They work horrendous hours as latter-day, secular monks, yet the gods to which they are dedicated are no longer spiritual or even societal but their own power, wealth, and prestige. An essential trait of the gamers is one-sided striving for self. The arrival of the gamers was crucial in several ways to the flat, agile corporate structures of the global economy, beginning with the extraordinary organizational and managerial sophistication they brought. The entrepreneurialism of the gamers and long hours they are willing to work have been vital to the streamlined new structures that place great stress on top managers and staff. Their facility with flexibly assuming and delegating authority, which the other-directed employees of the 1950s could not begin to match, was well suited to the needs of global-capitalist business.

Their facility with flexibly assuming and delegating authority, which the other-directed employees of the 1950s could not begin to match, was well suited to the needs of global-capitalist business. The gamers have also been masters at creating and utilizing technology. Where peasants wanted only enough for their modest, customary lives, the early middle class wanted a standard of living ample for economic security, and the other-directed organization men and women of the mid- ⋅ 20^(th) century wanted indefinitely more for comfort and keeping up with the Joneses, the gamers “want all” – it must have been in the 1980s that I saw a Marin County Porsche with that exquisite California license plate. If the middle class of the 1950s was consumerist, the gamers are hyper-consumerist. The gamers in politics or culture may not be quite as materialistic as those in business or finance, but they undertake the same gaming toward goals of high office, prestigious professorships, or renown as artists, nor are they averse to making a lot of money along the way. Overloaded by the outsized demands they place upon themselves and invite employers to place upon them, the gamers multi-task through large parts of their days, nervously checking their hand-held devices for instant messages, emails, and trade signals from investment apps or services while talking on the phone or listening to what someone is telling them from the office doorway. Their eyes intermittently glaze over in conversation through the day as their attention skips around among their diverse undertakings. Burdened and cluttered, their minds are easily distracted during personal interaction.137 Their narrow focus on instrumental goals and multi-channel juggling of tasks displace attention to and understanding of the big picture, the larger meaning of what they are witnessing and doing. The stress from the gamers’ virtuoso participation in extremely complex, rapidly changing, high-stakes competition is so great that they need heavy “R&R” when off the job. During time off, they tend at first to manifest harried weariness from their chronic overwork, evoking the exhaustion of the dog-tired peasants of traditional hierarchical societies or exceedingly hard-working farmers of early liberal ones. Leisure for the well-educated and prosperous once meant time for reflection, leadership, and creative activity. The long hours of hyperrationality and discipline today are often followed by depleted, low energy “vegging” in complete relaxation, such as blanket consumption of popular culture.

When their energy revives – if they do not return at once to work – they tend to intensely pursue often obscure hobbies, amusements, or challenges, skillfully gaming such activities as wine connoisseurship, exotic travel, rock climbing, or collecting rarities, not infrequently to the point of distinction. For example, while unwinding from his furious publishing pace, a gamer professor of history might over many years put in place during off hours a perfect Renaissance Tuscan garden in his spacious yard. Or, as David Brooks says, gamers may “turn nature into an achievement course, a series of ordeals and obstacles they can conquer.” In their compulsive striving, “they want to be a ‘serious’ walker, tennis player, skier or whatever it is that they are pursuing in leisure.”138 The high new bar set by the gamers was responsible for more than a little of the increased inequality in first-world countries over the past few decades. People have been competing with economic prodigies some of whom had been on the fast track to success since they were three-yearolds in select, accelerated preschools. Just as the disciplined Puritans and Jews of the 17^(th) -century Netherlands, England, Scotland, Switzerland, and American colonies pulled ahead with their capitalist-honed middle-class characters, the gamers were now doing so with their greatly more competitive, market-honed characters. The gamer upper class comprises approximately the top 5 percent of the population in the most-developed societies, though smaller percentages in less-developed ones. The scale of this upper class is determined by the number whose character is dominated by individualistic higher self-management. Such reflexivity is ascendant only in the gamers but also present to a degree in the executive and professional upper-middle class, comprising the second to top 5 percent of the population, and to a lesser degree the broad upper-middle class of better-prepared college graduates, comprising the second to top decile. Gamer virtuosity tapers off into mere competence in the upper-middle class, which is hybrid, partly gamer and partly middle class. Applying the gamer criteria far more strictly limits the focus to the top gamers who make up the top 1 percent of the gamer class, or, setting aside their families, some 50,000 or 60,000 elite gamers who manifest the gamer type in sharpest relief and substantially own and run the United States.139 At its most developed, the universalism or orientation toward the whole that was relatively widespread during the national era in the United States was as self-aware as the perspective of the gamers, only it was collectively rather than individually directed.

It may have had lacunae with respect to difference, but whether religious or secular, that universalism was oriented toward balancing and harmonizing all sides of society and life. Then came a turning point around 1970 when those on business and professional tracks began reacting against the low-key other-directedness and geniality of the 1950s as well as the naïve idealism of the 1960s. In their hubris they jettisoned concern with society and instead spurred themselves on for career advance. The moral collectivist service of the national era began ebbing, and the amoral individualist maneuvering of the global era began flowing. In school and during their early careers, many of the most able, best educated, and most ambitious began coming to the notion that they would neither reject nor reform the system but would game it for their own purposes. In the language of the time, they would “beat the system.” When gamers, whether in business, law, politics, or civil service, notice something amiss in the social or regulatory policy of their country, for instance, they do not think, “How can I bring this condition to the attention of public officials to correct for us all?” but rather “How can I profit from it?”140 Gamers pride themselves above all on the smarts invested in their complex, high-level individual reflexivity; but they are in denial regarding the high-level collective reflexivity, the thoughtfulness, ingenuity, and care with which large numbers of their national-era predecessors watched over and nurtured society.141 It does not fit with their cynical assumptions. The gamers’ attainment of rarified personal awareness has come at the expense of a radical withdrawal of attention from their society, civilization, and aspects of the human not of immediate use to them in their marches to success. Their higher reflexivity represents massive diversion of moral attention and concern, from society to their personal quest for power and wealth. With well-rounded moral codes, the national-era professionals and specialists of 60 years ago were “experts.” In addition to denoting mastery of their field, the designation connoted reliability in making their knowledge or its fruits available to others. This expectation had ethical content and was wedded to a norm of service. Gamer professionals and specialists have instead been virtuosi. They have routinely mastered what they have done, to an even higher level, but their reliability has been open to question: In general, they cannot be counted upon to act in the interest of others, and for this reason they tend to be treated guardedly. There are no experts in the old sense – everyone", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634243384_cleaned.txt:76:81331592cba5", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 1266, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634243384_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634243384", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634243384_cleaned", "chunk_index": 77, "text": "fruits available to others.

There are no experts in the old sense – everyone has had to look out for themselves. This reality cuts both ways: Patients or clients have to be suspicious that medical or investment advice they receive may merely be making its sources money or protecting them legally, while the professionals have to be suspicious that patients or clients may just be setting them up for a lawsuit or leading them on for free service. Just as the gamers pay little attention to rules of other sorts, they pay little attention to moral rules. They do what advances their aims and what they want to do. As George Friedman says, the gamers appear “brutally indifferent to any interests outside their own.”142 Their families often excepted, the gamers tend to believe in nothing beyond themselves. Charles Murray refers to them as a “hollow elite” because they have “no code of values that they feel they are living up to and that they think are important.”143 With most of the stewardship and trust gone, the morality of the gamers, such as it is, has tended toward radical relativism. Hillary Clinton’s repeated statements over the years to the effect that reality or the truth is what people socially construct it to be, breathtakingly reflect gamer skepticism and cynicism. So, tacitly, does Senator Mike Lee’s whiplash-inducing U-turn on Google’s exercise of monopoly power. For the most part, the gamers do not think in terms of personal right and wrong or virtue and vice. When self-conscious about morality, they tend to avoid moral judgment or absolutes altogether. In the spirit of the times, the gamers achieved considerable tolerance in many areas during the global era, but their otherwise habitual skepticism and even tolerance seldom extended to politics, where they easily slipped into divisive, partisan opinion. Except for a rare few, the gamers have not been leaders, which is to say, moral and wise human beings whose high positions and formidable capabilities are directed toward the well-being of society and their fellow citizens.144 Top institutions of higher education during the global era liked to think they were grooming leaders, but they were not, not in the true sense; they were batch-producing skilled but uncaring strivers. As the anonymous California congressman said in his recent tell-all book, “Rules don’t apply to us, just [to] the rubes we represent.”145 What gamers give to and receive from friends and acquaintances in the nation’s capital is the infamous “D.C. scalp stare,”", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634243384_cleaned.txt:77:4102e415c249", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 1267, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634243384_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634243384", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634243384_cleaned", "chunk_index": 78, "text": "of society and their fellow citizens.144 Top institutions of higher education during the global era liked to think they were grooming leaders, but they were not, not in the true sense; they were batch-producing skilled but uncaring strivers.

The gamers have been less prominent in continental Europe than in the United States, while the U.K. pattern has been intermediate between the two, but closer to their American cousins. More Europeans than Americans have refused to be led into the one-sidedness of gaming. The phenomenon has been delayed, moderated, and partly sublimated on the continent by concern for society. Just as the bourgeois were less influential and less unabashed in Europe during the 19^(th) century, so the gamers were during the global era. The gamers have been more concentrated in several third-world countries than in Europe; in Singapore, Taiwan, and South Korea for example. There have been few gamers in Islamic countries (although the few have been very influential) but many among the Muslims of the West and India. Gamers have dominated the most developed authoritarian societies for the last two-to-four decades, including China, Russia, and to a lesser extent Iran, Saudi Arabia, and the Gulf States. Gamers assumed control of China when Deng Xiaoping took over the Communist Party and established his regime in 1978. The party’s brazen cynicism in simultaneously selling Maoism and Maseratis by the early 21^(st) century, was vintage gamer. So was Xi Jinping’s announcement of major troop cuts immediately before the onset of a large military parade in 2015. China (much like Taiwan, Singapore, and Malaysia) has witnessed the gamer phenomenon but with a difference: Those with family connections have received the opportunities, such as permission to obtain the most sought-after credentials, get the best jobs, and move to the cities. Connections continued to make a much bigger difference in East Asia than in the West. Among less developed authoritarian societies, Syria under Bashar al-Assad, Venezuela under Hugo Chavez, and Nicaragua under Daniel Ortega have also been dominated by gamers. A key source of the rise of the gamers, as of much else during the global era, was the fast-moving rough and tumble of wide-open global capitalism.

A key source of the rise of the gamers, as of much else during the global era, was the fast-moving rough and tumble of wide-open global capitalism. The world economic markets were so horrendously competitive that, under their pressure, corporate business demanded and elicited ever-higher levels of profit and performance from top executives. The most sought-after employers of the national era did not so single-mindedly demand such adeptness; they were looking as much for prospective employees’ integrity and character. Gaming arose as growing numbers of the most talented, under strong new pressures and inducements, became so good at what they were doing and began so intensely striving to do still better that they attained higher individualistic self-control. As gamer executives responded with supreme effort and subtle insight, they also rose, in time, to virtuosity in their work. In a similar way, when top law graduates were placed in large firms having the highest expectations and potential rewards, frequently with the same corporations as clients, their firms also demanded and drew forth sustained diligence and, in time, higher reflexivity and virtuosity. Being professionally engaged with the leading consulting and accounting firms where the stakes were no less high also promoted the gamers’ higher-level self-consciousness and virtuoso performance. The stakes in politics, though different, were every bit as high. As I put it in my earlier book, “In addition to outstanding ability, preparation, and effort, only with higher reflexivity and nimbleness do [young people] flourish in investment banks, consulting firms, or the halls of Congress.”148 The gamers were the latest in the series of fundamental character types that for the most part emerged historically from business, including simple ego-dominant hagglers, superego-dominant bourgeois, and other-directed, early- and mid-20^(th) -century white-collar employees. Gaming was given additional impetus in the United States by sharp competition for promising employment during the 1970s, as the baby boomers moved into tight job markets, while global capitalism was undermining the national protections that had sustained the comparatively forgiving US business environment that held through the 1960s. It was becoming more difficult to retain a sense of unhurried ease or societal stewardship amid the intensifying competition. Another major contribution to the advent of the gamers was that students of modest origins were given new opportunity by the opening of the best schools and colleges during the 1950s and 1960s to those objectively performing at high levels. An idea of what it meant for merit to be defined objectively may be gained by noting the ninety-five-point increase in Harvard’s verbal SAT scores between 1950 and 1960.149 Other top universities and colleges also witnessed sharp gains in test scores. Part of what enabled the ascent of the gamers was that the", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634243384_cleaned.txt:79:9646591842bb", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 1269, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634243384_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634243384", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634243384_cleaned", "chunk_index": 80, "text": "modest origins were given new opportunity by the opening of the best schools and colleges during the 1950s and 1960s to those objectively performing at high levels.

Part of what enabled the ascent of the gamers was that the social democratization of top schools delivered unprecedented numbers of extremely bright, exceptionally well educated young people, “injecting a massive jolt of human capital into the American economy,” as Murray puts it.150 The qualitative leaps in performance brought by the gamers would never have been possible without this democratic talent pool. As ambitious, capable students were increasingly allowed entrance into elite colleges and universities irrespective of class, culture, and group origins, the clubby WASP establishment with its genteel manners and traditions of moderation and service was largely displaced. This opening helped change the American upper class from one of inherited and taken-for-granted privilege and responsibility into one of talent, credentials, and willingness to give all for personal advancement. The growing sophistication of the most selective schools and universities went hand-in-hand with and greatly facilitated the emergence of gaming. Advanced education of budding gamers in mathematics, logic, law, economics, engineering, and other rigorous disciplines strongly channeled their lives into the molds of rationality and instrumentalism. At the best business schools, sophisticated, self-conscious knowledge of management, finance, and corporate culture was conveyed as students were groomed in the subtle teamwork skills that form much of the real payoff of MBA programs. So much of such subtlety had been learned about management, marketing, and finance by the 1970s that rising to the level of performance newly demanded by the corporate world increasingly required both higher reflexivity and professional education of those who would approach its upper ranks. In their internships and early positions, gamers-in-training subsequently acquired invaluable experience as they applied themselves for long hours to high-level tasks, involving real business problems. Noting the changing circumstances as they themselves were changing, ambitious parents began gaming their children’s experience and development for admission to and success in elite educational institutions and careers. As fast-track high-school and university students gamed their coursework and extracurricular activities with growing proficiency, they learned the deft, modulated ways that would increasingly mark their careers and lives.

The gamers became what they are through exposure not only to economic markets and educational opportunities but also through exposure to sociocultural markets. The most sophisticated elements of the 1960s uprising in the United States raised themselves to higher self-consciousness and self-control as had some of the great modernist philosophers and social thinkers upon whom they drew, including Marx, Nietzsche, Freud, and Marcuse. When influential figures of that decade did the same, they negated in all directions from their new redoubt of higher criticism. Carrying on the bohemian alienation of many cultural luminaries of the national era, the rebels of the 1960s were still idealist and collectivist, disdaining and taking for granted the economy. The die was cast as many of the rebels’ younger peers attained the same reflexivity during the early 1970s while emphatically rejecting the collectivism, idealism, and anti-capitalism of the previous decade. But the gamers retained the earlier decade’s radical relativism and more than a little of its proclivity to conflict. At work and in life, they too began taking most of their own and others’ assumptions as limited in place and time and no better or worse than any others. Partly underlying the gamers’ course has been a feeling of superiority to and rejection of the middle class and the society and civilization it has shaped. Their bohemian legacy helped bring them to gaming in sociocultural as well as in economic arenas. Yet the crucial source of the gamers’ withdrawal from leadership and responsibility was not their support for the sociocultural markets but their adoption already during the 1960s of the multiculturalism that shaped what they brought into those markets. For that doctrine’s attacks upon and smearing of the United States and nearly everything American, Christian, and Western stripped the new upper class of concern for its country, fellow citizens, traditions, and civilization. Multiculturalist alienation left the gamers bereft of a sense of responsibility with which to lead the country or to restrain their private interests and desires on its behalf. As multiculturalists attacked and besmirched the country, its citizens, and Western Civilization, the young of talent increasingly turned their backs upon this society and smugly devoted their abilities and energy to furthering their own interests without regard to others. A wise, respectful, and constructive ideology would have nourished leadership and responsibility in a new upper class. Character is strongly conditioned by whether young people are brought up to respect their country, tradition, and fellow citizens. When they are not, many of them are going to withhold what is due to society and to others. The separation of the gamers and to a degree the upper-middle class from the rest that Charles Murray beautifully sketches in his book Coming Apart was also crucial in facilitating the rise of the gamers, for geographical concentration provided the hothouse setting within which they", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634243384_cleaned.txt:81:5b94adb31396", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 1271, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634243384_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634243384", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634243384_cleaned", "chunk_index": 82, "text": "conditioned by whether young people are brought up to respect their country, tradition, and fellow citizens.

The separation of the gamers and to a degree the upper-middle class from the rest that Charles Murray beautifully sketches in his book Coming Apart was also crucial in facilitating the rise of the gamers, for geographical concentration provided the hothouse setting within which they could rapidly develop a distinct sociocultural matrix that fostered gaming. We may happily note that segregation by race has considerably diminished since 1965, but we must also note that segregation by education and income has increased even more. The gamers’ attainment of critical mass around the centers of the economy, government, media, and higher education provided them the sociocultural support with which to homogenize and boldly go their own way. Their stark new difference of character, class, culture, and geography helped dissolve their sense of larger community and purpose, as did their endemic hubris, multiculturalism, and obliviousness to the whole. The gamers’ radical one-sidedness and alienation have also been products of the newness of their higher self-control. Their way has been in keeping with Hegel’s dictum that those newly aware on a given level tend first to negate difference, with others and within themselves, before turning toward reconciliation. Since they are powerful and exhilarating, higher perspectives tend initially to imperiousness and negativism.151 It takes time to work the rough edges from unfolding character types, allowing balanced versions of them to come to the fore. When middle-class discipline first emerged on a large scale in the Reformation, it too was severe and one-sided. It began moderating in the Enlightenment and by the early and mid- 20^(th) century had been worked into the mature form that was impressive in the American and British upper-middle and middle classes of the time. Just as the basic self-control of most in the middle class had been harsh in the 16^(th) and early 17^(th) centuries, the higher self-control of most gamers has been harsh for more than half a century. Under the turbulent economic growth and sociocultural differentiation of the global era, few were able to achieve the distance, tranquility, and senses of gratitude and responsibility from which leadership emanates. Europe’s greater restriction of capitalism than the United States contributed to its lesser prevalence of gaming. That hierarchical societies were dominant until recently across much of the continent meant the persistence of humanistic culture valuing leisure and the ideal but disparaging the economic and material. Relatively balanced upper and upper-middle classes have somewhat reduced gaming in Europe as they have the wideopen capitalism out of which it in good part emerged. Yet, as the global markets have forced Europeans to make concessions, they too have found themselves with more gamers, particularly in the younger generations.

Yet, as the global markets have forced Europeans to make concessions, they too have found themselves with more gamers, particularly in the younger generations. Europeans have also gotten more gamers than they otherwise would have by opening elite institutions and weakening upper-class standards of distinction in the wake of the late 1960s uprisings such as that of May 1968 in France. The third world witnessed the rise of its gamers as it has encountered the same global economic markets as the first world and become prosperous enough to send more of its most talented to study at worldclass universities and to build excellent educational systems of its own. The gamers’ power in our society has come in large part from the fact that there are so many of them. A 5 percent upper class may sound like a small one, but where most upper classes historically have made up only about 1 percent of their societies, American gamers number more than 16 million, including dependents, contributing greatly to their enormous power and influence. Their great ability, single-mindedness, and remarkable sociocultural homogeneity following decades of self-segregation have also strengthened their position, drawing most of the upper-middle class to their side, for example. The ultimate threat they pose comes equally from their strength and their hubris; in particular their advanced inability to acknowledge the humanity of, and recognize themselves in, the more than 160 million fellow Americans who are middle class. The gamers may be different in manner and style from the brash upper class of the Gilded Age, but the decisive differences are circumstantial, including the degree to which they have cemented themselves into positions of dominance across all institutions and the degree to which they have alienated themselves from the middle class and the society they associate with it. That and their increasing segregation invited the narcissism and hubris of their profound alienation from the middle class and the liberal society with which they associate it. No larger percentage of them may be evil than the percentage of their late 19^(th) -century predecessors, but the degree to which they are filled with themselves, the intensity with which their will-to-power asserts itself, the way in which they shrink from the middle class, and above all the lockstep way in which they dismiss the universal in religion, philosophy, politics, and life pose distinctly greater threats to this society than did the likes of Jay Gould, Henry Frick, and Boss Tweed.

The ascent of the gamers has been beneficial in some respects, espeand application. Think for example of the great economic value of what Bill Gates, Steve Jobs, Elon Musk, Jack Welch, and Sam Walton have accomplished, gamers one and all. On the other hand, grievous, offsetting collateral damage to society has resulted from the gamers’ indifference toward the effects of their actions upon others and upon society, as is painfully apparent through the chapters to follow. The very best of the global era, overcame gaming and instead embraced their fellow citizens and the larger society.152 They became statesmen and wise counselors, carrying out missions rather than games. Among the most dedicated and exemplary of the era, leaders one and all, have been King Abdullah of Jordan, Tony Blair, Bill Bradley, Willy Brandt, William Bratton, Tom Coburn, the Dalai Lama, Bob Gates, Billy Graham, John Paul II, Bob Kerrey, Henry Kissinger, Irving Kristol, Heather MacDonald, George Mitchell, Charles Murray, David Petraeus, Colin Powell, Ronald Reagan, Helmut Schmidt, Eric Sevareid, George Shultz, Thomas Sowell, Margaret Thatcher, Paul Volcker, James Woolsey, and Lee Kwan Yew. These men and women may have agreed with each other on little more than that we ought to attempt to overcome oppositions and work together for the common good, but that is all we need. They have brilliantly directed their extraordinary talents in different ways toward the long-term well-being of the whole. Such leaders have been all too few since 1965. On a more modest level, although hardly less important cumulatively, gamers could remain what they are in other respects but balance their stellar careers with moral restraint, community involvement, and great families, and some have done so. Most of them by far, however, have instead been feverishly milling about for personal gain while leaving society adrift. Average citizens will follow leaders, but they will not follow amoral, cynical, and frequently conflictual elites; they will defer to a universalistic upper class but not to an indifferent, manipulative, and self-dealing one. The metaphor of the game with regard to the pace-setting new upper class of the global era is apt not only for its focus on their single-minded competitiveness but also for the light it casts upon their ultimate unseriousness. The pure gamers climb more ladders and take more exotic vacations to nowhere. The 60-, 80-, and even 100-hour weeks of so many supremely talented men and women represent the clear-cutting of oldgrowth forests. The gamers could contribute so much more if they only cared.

All but a few have instead been making Faustian bargains, the devastating consequences of which we will be encountering for a long time. Yet, since each of their institutions and character types sheds crucial independent light upon a society and time, let us next consider the democratic political institutions that gamers were increasingly subverting during the global era, also with major detrimental consequences dernity were confined almost entirely to the West until the global era, although not all Western countries had fully participated in them. Democracy153 diffused rapidly during the late 20^(th) century, beginning with southern Europe. In 1974 Portugal initiated what became a great wave of democratization. After the death of General Franco in Spain the following year, Prime Minister Adolfo Suarez adroitly brokered a series of pacts between opposing forces to ground his country’s new democracy upon reconciliation, balance, guarantees, security, and trust. Spain’s democracy also required the wise, courageous defense of King Juan Carlos in facing down a coup attempt in 1981. Its “pacted” approach was particularly influential in Latin American democratic transitions, which were frequently negotiated between a hierarchical regime and its democratic opposition such that a balance of power was maintained between multiple forces.154 Greece too became democratic during the 1970s. Latin America went from minimally to overwhelmingly democratic during the last quarter of the 20^(th) century. The Philippines became democratic in 1986, Taiwan in 1987, Indonesia in 1998, and South Korea in steps through the late 1980s and 1990s. Dramatic democratization occurred among the formerly Soviet-dominated Eastern European countries when, after decades of oppression, most of their authoritarian regimes imploded following the collapse of the Berlin Wall in 1989. The Balkans became predominantly democratic in the aftermath of Yugoslavia’s disintegration, beginning in 1992. South Africa, Nigeria, and Ghana became predominantly democratic during the 1990s. Already established in the mid- 20^(th) century soon after independence and partition, India’s parliamentary democracy has been fragmented and disjointed; but, like much else in that country, it has performed reasonably well under the circumstances, even considering its interruption for a year and a half of dictatorship by Indira Gandhi. The two largest parties, Congress and the BJP, primarily represent secular elites and Hindu nationalists respectively. The Congress Party, long the stronger of the two, was closely aligned with entrenched bureaucratic and economic interests but sought to form coalitions with lower-caste parties, in part via the country’s huge affirmative action program.", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634243384_cleaned.txt:85:8d2b3d446589", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 1275, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634243384_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634243384", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634243384_cleaned", "chunk_index": 86, "text": "like much else in that country, it has performed reasonably well under the circumstances, even considering its interruption for a year and a half of dictatorship by Indira Gandhi.

In opposition to the elites, the BJP sought bold reforms, opportunity, and more responsive government, gaining relatively consistent support from the middle class and notable support across the caste and Dalit spectrum. India has been, by far, the world’s largest democracy. The formation of many new democracies during the late 20^(th) century was a most important achievement. The world had only 12 democracies in 1941 when the United States entered World War II, but it had 120 by the year 2000.155 In late 1973, fewer than a quarter of the world’s countries were democratic. “Of the 110 nondemocratic states in 1974, 63 (or 57 percent) subsequently made a transition to democracy,” joining those already democratic.156 Forty authoritarian countries became democratic following the collapse of the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia. As late as 1988, only 40 percent of the world’s regimes were democratic, but by 1994, 60 percent were.157 The extent of global democratization remains significant when populations are considered instead of the numbers of countries: In 1973, 36 percent of the world’s population lived in democratic countries, 64 percent in authoritarian ones.158 By the year 2000, the population in democratic countries had risen to 57 percent while that in authoritarian countries had declined to 43 percent.159 The Persistence of Authoritarianism in the Core Hierarchical Societies, 1974–2000. Although most third-world and Eastern European countries were becoming democratic, the core hierarchical states remained authoritarian.160 Boris Yeltsin repudiated authoritarianism, took steps toward democratizing Russia between 1991 and 1993, and cultivated the appearance of democracy, but ruled autocratically almost from the beginning and suppressed parliament and the constitutional court already in 1993. He sharply reduced the security services for a time but was immersed in and surrounded by corruption throughout and kept the FRS close to him. Mao’s communist regime, after crushing opposition and concentrating power on the mainland, reviled and suppressed the well-educated, former property owners, moderates, and others with independence for nearly three decades. As Mao purged China of traditional and liberal elements, he willfully curtailed the country’s development, leaving it weak and impoverished by the time of his death in 1976. The Deng regime remained strictly authoritarian while rapidly introducing economic markets. It long maintained the ruse of political liberalization by slowly and partially opening local government to competitive democratic contests during the 1990s and early 2000s, but the regime’s true colors were evident in its forceful suppression of the democracy", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634243384_cleaned.txt:86:ea94ca37292d", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 1276, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634243384_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634243384", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634243384_cleaned", "chunk_index": 87, "text": "three decades.

The Islamic world intensified its perennial authoritarianism during the global era, Indonesia and a few other countries excepted. Large numbers of Muslim states were tyrannical, including the Assad’s Syria and Saddam Hussein’s Iraq. Robust coercive apparatuses were prominent features of most Muslim regimes. Their security forces were often formed largely of conservative rural elements whose ethnicity was selected to help ensure loyalty. Some Muslim regimes remained monarchical, though, and a few of these, such as Morocco under King Hassan, were comparatively moderate and more accepted by their populations than the dictatorships. Politics, the Media, and Citizen Involvement in the United States. The politics of the global era was intimately associated with the explosion of the mass media. Public life was increasingly carried on via them, with the predominant influence increasingly exercised by organized interests over a distracted and passively consuming, if irritable and skittish, electorate. Politicians were acutely aware of the need to market themselves in a complex and subtle media environment and became highly skilled at doing so. Sensitive to a fault to changes in opinion polls, they relied upon operatives adept at public relations to staff their offices and campaigns as media savviness became the analog to the sophism and rhetoric of old – those with it tended to win and those without it, to lose. PR skills comprised a good deal of what registered as charisma. Fiercely fought, many-sided PR campaigns deluged citizens with political information but fragmented and decontextualized it in barrages of 10-second sound-bytes and 30-second ads. Political careers were made and broken through the media. The news played a central role in media politics. During the national era, norms of journalistic responsibility had supported the hallowed notion that the press and broadcasters were to carry important but distant news as a matter of civic obligation, despite its limited commercial value. U.S. television networks, although private, had regularly supported money-losing news divisions while the governments of many other developed democracies had publicly funded news broadcasting. Networks and newspapers had frequently maintained larger staffs of correspondents and reporters and supported higher-caliber news and analysis than was justifiable in stark terms of profit and loss. Owning a television network, newspaper, newsmagazine, or publishing house was often regarded as a public", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634243384_cleaned.txt:87:d79161742411", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 1277, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634243384_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634243384", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634243384_cleaned", "chunk_index": 88, "text": "distant news as a matter of civic obligation, despite its limited commercial value.

Owning a television network, newspaper, newsmagazine, or publishing house was often regarded as a public trust. During the global period, by contrast, the news media were increasingly owned by large corporations whose callings were no more exalted than their quarterly profits. Fewer news bureaus were maintained, and news content was mingled with entertainment. Orientation toward large audiences and profitability led toward fluff, violence, sensationalism, and negativism to grab attention, draw coveted audiences, and game revenues while displacing substantive news. Much of the most prominent journalism of the first postwar decades had trained its eye on how well society as a whole was faring, but journalism rarely noticed it during the global era; it instead tended to report on the game, who was spinning and socially constructing what, when, how, and why. Tacit in this focus was the assumed relativism of good and bad or right and wrong – for the individual, the country, and the world. Paradoxically, global-era journalism did acknowledge that there was such a thing as what was truly better for the interests of this or that class, group, party, or person. The focus was redirected from the whole toward the part. Mid-century journalists, in a spirit of public service and professional pride, had also taken norms of value neutrality seriously when presenting the news. When their successors describe, interpret, or explain – insofar as they are insulated from economic constraints – they far more often impart a political slant to the news. As the influence of the 1960s generation slowly wound its way through the media, the New York Times went from relatively neutral news reporting to reporting what advanced its publisher, editors, and journalists’ political agendas in the early 1990s. Pieces of reportage often became smirking political blows delivered underhandedly. Times photographs of the two presidential candidates during the closing weeks of the 1992 U.S. elections presented an amusing example. The photos selected of Bill Clinton tended to be commanding and presidential, while those selected of President G. H. W. Bush were awkward and silly. Journalists went from being citizen-soldiers of the truth to being scrappy participants in partisan politics. Journalists, like other intellectuals, became overwhelmingly liberal in orientation. Each cause, issue, and candidate they supported had the home-court advantage; each they opposed played its games on the road. By the end of the period, journalism had been reduced to politics. Much as bureaucrats exercised considerable political power, although their doing so was neither fully acknowledged nor approved, so did journalists.", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634243384_cleaned.txt:88:e50d9a5f890d", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 1278, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634243384_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634243384", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634243384_cleaned", "chunk_index": 89, "text": "were awkward and silly.

Much as bureaucrats exercised considerable political power, although their doing so was neither fully acknowledged nor approved, so did journalists. Those in the media became an important part of the political class, the fourth branch of government, as some put it. Yet much of the citizenry ignored at least the elite media and went elsewhere to find independent views. Cable television brought greater variety, populism, and shrillness to the news. The rise of the Internet brought a kaleidoscopic proliferation of media sites and blogs, providing astonishingly abundant and varied news and commentary, if still skewed. As newspapers were in economic freefall and the elite media in relative decline, citizens faced a greatly more open, if uneven and challenging, news market from which to draw in forming their opinions. Into this journalistic hall of mirrors flowed the exceedingly subtle issueand image-management of the gamer participants in the news, for whom the truth was socially constructed and in quotation marks. Whoever’s narratives and definitions of the situation captured the news set the agenda of public discourse and muted the opposition. The result was many levels of sophistication combined in myriads of diverse standpoints and interests in the media’s swirling bricolage. As politics became a struggle over controlling media attention in which rhetorical virtuosi engaged in no-holdsbarred PR combat, journalists were well positioned to play a prominent role. Amid the deft feints and interpretations, it became difficult for anyone to maintain steadiness of perspective, not least the politicians and journalists themselves. Average citizens were at a severe disadvantage. Political knowledge, interest, and participation by the public declined amid the overwhelming complexity. According to Robert D. Putnam, “voting in America [was] down by about a quarter, and interest in public affairs by about one-fifth” during the last quarter of the to a 20^(th) century.161 Greater participation returned episodically, as in the 2008, 2012, and 2016 presidential elections, but involvement tended to fall back to the new norm soon after. The oversight of many having been withdrawn from the political markets, the governing class narrowed, and political inequality increased, to an even greater degree than did economic inequality. The Triumph of the Special Interests. American political parties slightly loosened and weakened overall in the global era from what they had been in the national era. Party conventions yielded most of their power to nominate candidates to primary elections during the 1960s and 1970s, but those primaries made room for other political actors and entities to move in.

Powerbrokers became even more significant players than they had been, but they operated in a more roundabout fashion by arranging a great deal of the context, while no longer directly providing the main event. As the parties receded, the special interests became larger, better organized, and more entrenched, lavishly pumping money into politics. Particularly after the Supreme Court rulings of the 1970s that spending money on political campaigns was a first amendment right and of 2010 in the Citizens United case that corporations had free-speech rights comparable to those of individual citizens, the American political system was awash in money and cynicism. Politicians became increasingly free to auction their services to the highest bidders in campaign contributions, political support, stock tips, and offers of lucrative employment or business opportunities after leaving office. Plenty of calculated self-dealing had been witnessed before in American politics, but its nearly general practice with only the barest moral limits became an increasingly striking feature. Peggy Noonan rightly characterized the Obama administration as “all-politicsall-the-time,” although the label applies to the gamers of both parties.162 Typical of what happened during the global era in U.S. politics, even at the local level, occurred in a Boston suburb when longstanding mutual respect and consensus-building yielded to organized interest-group maneuvers (by teachers in this instance, often police, fire, other public employees, or developers elsewhere) to stack meetings and force through agendas in their narrow interest while disregarding the needs of the larger community.163 All too many politicians alternately made craven deals and pandered to the thoughtless whims of distracted and frequently self-centered citizens. The New Polarization in the United States. The national-liberal upper class played a lead role in formulating federal, state, and local policy through its clubs and informal social networks as well as by setting the tone of morals and manners.164 During the 1950s and early 1960s, Congressional “disputes were mediated by a culture that encouraged a kind of heterogeneous civility.”165 Robert Byrd embodied that culture throughout his long career; few did after him. The atmosphere of boosterism, courtesy, and trust began falling away in the United States during the 1960s. Following the collapse of the national-liberal establishment and political consensus during the mid-1960s, American society became increasingly polarized. Amid conflictualist political melees, division and acrimony became the order of the day. Politics became an unrestrained, amoral exercise in gonzo attacks, smear campaigns, and gotcha journalism.

Amid conflictualist political melees, division and acrimony became the order of the day. Politics became an unrestrained, amoral exercise in gonzo attacks, smear campaigns, and gotcha journalism. When in the Congressional minority, each party, as politically advantageous, sabotaged needed legislation on many occasions in order to attempt to undermine the majority. Not surprisingly, elected officials from the two parties frequently came to loathe each other. Nowhere was the contentiousness more apparent than in skirmishes over Supreme Court nominations. The confrontational mode of the 1960s and early 1970s came to dominate many aspects of the era as political combat prevailed. Raw partisanship in the forms of hardball politics, negative campaigning, and shrill personal attacks increasingly became the norm. The bitter late-1960s standoffs on some university campuses between radical leftist students and conservative Young Americans for Freedom (YAF) members foreshadowed the divisions that began making their appearance a decade later at the national level.166 Taking rancorous dispute to be the normal way of treating oppositions, the 1960s generation was a conflictualist one, many of whose basics were passed on to subsequent generations. The global-era generations having been badly divided internally, polarization understandably occurred between the gamers and those with the audacity to oppose them. The greatly outnumbered Christian conservatives of the 1960s, precursors of the Christian Right of the 1980s, adopted their own mildly contentious manner in response. The mutual hostility, personal attacks, and character assaults between the Clinton White House and press on the one side and Newt Gingrich and the Congressional Republicans on the other during the 1990s represented the standard, divisive conflict between political opponents of the new generation and era. The combat waged by the Obama administration, whose declared policy was total political war against conservatives, intensified the pattern. Although the general public seldom punished the many flagrant offenders in vicious politics, it was nowhere near as polarized as the politicians and activists through the era. The key underlying problem in American politics from the 1990s on was a moral one. As Joan Didion says in Political Fictions, “Those inside the process … congealed into a political class, the defining characteristic of which … [was] its readiness to abandon those not inside the process.”167 According to Mark Leibovich, the constant refrain to each other by the self-referential members of the gamer political elite about what Washington had become was the cynical shrug, “It is what it is.”168 Moral decline hit American politics with force during the 1990s as the World War II and 1950s generations were leaving the arena, and the 1960s generation was taking over.

Insofar as it affected politics, this decline was concentrated among the gamers and, above all, the elites among them. The growing power and declining morality of elites and public officials directing large interests rendered the American political system increasingly dysfunctional. For example, Senate tradition and rules long hallowed the filibuster. After the loosening of requirements for ending a filibuster in 1975, a 60-vote majority was required to halt floor debate and proceed to a vote on an ordinary bill. The device had been used before on rare occasions when a few Senators or the minority party were extremely opposed to a piece of legislation, but it became standard partisan procedure during the global era. From the late 1960s, both parties when in opposition increasingly used the filibuster, and from the 1990s, they did so systematically to block the will of the majority. Amid amorality and division, the filibuster that had relied upon consensual restraint and convention in earlier eras brought gridlock. Even with changes in the law in 2013, allowing a simple majority to prevail for executive and judicial nominations other than those to the Supreme Court, the filibuster became a powerful obstruction. The Growing Political Stagnation of Other First-World Democracies. Democracy was improved in some respects in other first-world countries during the late 20^(th) century. The secret ballot spread, election monitoring strengthened, vote counting became more reliable, and the freedom to communicate and organize on behalf of diverse political persuasions was better ensured. Italy made progress toward overcoming lingering hierarchical influence during the 1970s. It introduced higher standards of public accountability and reduced political corruption during the 1990s. Minorities, from the Irish in England to Roma (Gypsies) in Hungary, gained political rights. Women in all developed democracies strengthened their rights to participate and hold office during the global era. Even in Switzerland, where women were not allowed to vote until 1971, they won a majority of governing cabinet positions in 2010. These democracies showed universalism in recognizing, adjusting to, and compromising with new entrants to the democratic marketplace and coaxing them into accepting democratic give and take. When, from time to time, a small, implacable, terrorist opposition was encountered, with whom neither ingenious flexibility nor supreme tolerance availed, as in the cases of Germany’s Rote Armee Faktion (RAF), Italy’s Brigate Rosse, and Spain’s ETA (the Basque Homeland and Freedom organization), persuasion was augmented by necessary force.

Yet most other first-world democracies declined in performance overall during the global era, as did the American. Political paralysis spread in Europe during the later decades of the global era, overshadowing improvements. Its democracies were growing sclerotic and less able to register and deal with major problems; witness the contradictions of the Eurozone, the denial by a majority of Swedish voters of the ruin advancing around them in connection with immigration, and the trailing off of defense budgets and military preparedness to dangerously low levels. European political parties had better subordinated the special interests and their disparate demands during the postwar decades and early global period than American parties;169 but much of that ability was lost as parties were overmatched by interest groups, and politicians became freer to wheel and deal. European voters may not have undergone the decline in political knowledge, interest, and participation that American voters did, but they often blithely ignored reality. The exceptional countries whose democracies were performing better by the end of the era than they had half a century earlier included Norway, Denmark, and Finland, countries with unusually high sociocultural coherence. Japanese democracy showed signs of regime vitality throughout the global era but was worrisomely constricted from the late 1980s through the end of the global era, unable to successfully address its economic problems. It did further open its political markets in 2009 as the victory of a new coalition led by that country’s Democratic Party seemed to be a milestone for its democracy. Until then, except for a brief interlude, Japan’s center-right Liberal Democratic Party had governed continuously since the 1950s with power shifting between changing coalitions of relatively enduring party factions, instead of the usual democratic oscillation between parties of the left and right. The party factions were built upon networks of personal bonds emanating from powerful patrons. In earlier times, as Seymour Lipset says, “Japan was an extremely hierarchical society, which placed a tremendous emphasis on obligation to those higher up as well as to those down below,”170 a pattern that continued to exert a good deal of influence. Japan’s democracy was advanced, but, like the Swedish capitalism that coexisted with a large public sector, its political markets retained subordinate elements of hierarchy. Its national bureaucracy long exercised inordinate power, often treating legislation as though it were just recommendation. Government agencies in Japan were marked by strong clientelism and loyalty.

The Reversal of Democratization and Strengthening of Authoritarianism in the Early $2 { \\cal I } ^ { s t }$ Century. After its stunning progress during the late 20^(th) century, net democratization ceased early in the 21^(st) century and began slightly reversing from about 2005. By the year 2000, 63 percent of countries were democratic, 37 percent authoritarian. That held through 2014, but more refined measures were showing a weakening in the third world.171 Moreover, as third-world democracies were slipping, and first-world ones were languishing, authoritarian regimes were upgrading and strengthening their rule. Vladimir Putin’s Russia exemplified the new authoritarianism. He was the President of Russia, not its First Secretary or Führer. He abided by the constitution when doing so was not too inconvenient, even to the extent of formally shifting to prime minister for four years when term limited. Under Putin, the Russian parliament met and passed laws, opposition parties seemed to flourish, representatives gave public speeches, and courts regularly heard cases and rendered judgments. Some relatively independent newspapers operated, though few if any independent television stations. Early 21^(st) century Russia, unlike the USSR, allowed a good deal of personal freedom. People had access to the Internet and came and went much more freely across borders. All of these apparently democratic features were, in reality, window dressing, not permitted to impinge upon the regime’s monopoly of power. Russia under Putin remained thoroughly autocratic. Public utterance or action that was anything more than innocuous was likely to bring the regime down hard upon its source, albeit in deceptive and surprising ways. Suppression could arrive, for example, in the form of arbitrary trouble with tax authorities, fire marshals, building inspectors, licensing authorities, or other regulatory officials. If the political threat were significant or persistent enough, the offender or those near and dear to him could expect to be badly beaten or murdered, again almost always under ambiguous and confusing conditions. The trappings of democracy were present, but, as described by William Dobson in The Dictator’s Learning Curve, artifice and guile mooted them in Putin’s gamer dictatorship.172 Cunningly, the Russian regime was highly aware that a major inherent weakness of hierarchical systems is their increasing tendency to suppress and distort the information getting to their rulers, with the result that governance tends to lose effectiveness. Accordingly, the Putin regime went out of its way to develop politically safe ways to keep in touch with popular knowledge, attitudes, and sentiments.

Accordingly, the Putin regime went out of its way to develop politically safe ways to keep in touch with popular knowledge, attitudes, and sentiments. One means by which it did so was via a large network of public-reception offices where citizens could lodge complaints against the government. The intent was that these be taken seriously, meticulously registered, and followed up. Another internal reality check was the Public Chamber, a large consultative body selected and convened as needed by the regime. It was drawn from people of many regions, social classes, sorts of expertise, and vantage points, to whom the regime could turn for information and advice, although it had neither independence nor authority.173 Putin remained quite popular. The Chinese upgraded their hierarchical rule with the Deng Xiaoping regime in 1978. Protected by Zhou Enlai through the perils of the Mao era, Deng founded his dynasty upon assembling a talented elite capable of working together and maintaining a relatively long-term time horizon, and placing limits on how elites and masses could involve themselves politically and conduct their lives, while maintaining illusions about continuing communism and engaging in democratization. The regime abandoned the latter charade in 2007. Amid intensifying censorship, China’s authoritarianism began tightening in the years afterward. After formally granting Hong Kong special civil liberties and limited democratic features for a period of 50 years when accepting its sovereignty from the United Kingdom in 1997, the regime increasingly reneged on that grant, provoking the protests of 2014. The rule of law might have gained force in the Chinese economy during the early 21^(st) century, but none of it translated to political rights. The Chinese regime was resourceful but vulnerable, because faced with the daunting challenge of staying ahead of the deep contradictions and tensions in its vast, rapidly changing country. Turkey followed a trajectory parallel in important ways to Russia and China over the last twenty years, first extending the appearances and some of the substance of democratization and then withdrawing them when safely in control. President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan and his Islamist Justice Party exercised power over a prolonged period, for the most part deftly. In office as prime minister from 2003 and as president from 2014, his first great political challenge was easing the military out of the veto it had held in Turkish politics since the reign of Ataturk in the 1920s. His doing so appeared to be a democratic objective, in that while Turkey had established a democracy in 1945, it had been suspended four times by military intervention, the last occasion in 1997.

His doing so appeared to be a democratic objective, in that while Turkey had established a democracy in 1945, it had been suspended four times by military intervention, the last occasion in 1997. Erdoğan and his associates’ painstaking restraint while pursuing effective economic policies enabled them to suppress the Turkish military’s limited, secular, tolerant, and stabilizing, though hierarchical, veto. In order to maintain the guise of democratization, Erdoğan and his Justice Party conveyed the impression of being dependable stewards of the country. After long presenting themselves as democratic, they broke the independent power of the military in 2011. Erdoğan and his party then immediately began acting autocratically and cracking down on critical news media and journalists, for Turkey’s unusual military had posed a check on misrule. Erdoğan made use of a failed coup attempt in 2016 to further consolidate his authoritarian rule. Although Egypt remained authoritarian throughout, its transient partial democratization from 2011 to 2013 also prominently involved the military. The Egyptian military cooperated with pro-democracy young people in the toppling of the Hosni Mubarak regime but was unwilling to step back from its dominant position or relinquish its control of up to one-third of the economy. What it was willing to do was allow some voice to the people, especially on matters of less concern. The Islamist Muslim Brotherhood’s election victory in 2012 and Mohamed Morsi’s accession to the presidency offered hope for a time, but Morsi was incorrigibly dictatorial, bullying his way in numerous directions and attempting to take more power than the generals were prepared to grant him. They ousted him in July of 2013 with popular support. Egypt was again governed by its military from 2014 under the leadership of the thoughtful, pragmatic President Abdel al-Sissi. Thailand’s Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra, a personally authoritarian, multimillionaire crony capitalist with a police background, mounted successful populist appeals to the countryside and began consolidating power extra-constitutionally in the early 2000s, impairing the democratic regime that had been established in 1997. According to Larry Diamond, “Thaksin was undermining the rule of law, dismantling constitutional checks and balances, stifling dissent, delegitimizing opposition, and dividing the country.”174 Charges of disclosure violations and corruption hung over him until he was ousted by a liberal-minded military coup in 2006 supported by Thailand’s urban middle class and respected king. The polarization was ratcheted up when, with Thaksin in exile, his sister won election as prime minister in 2011. After prolonged turmoil, the military again took over in 2014.

Ecuador took a similar turn under Rafael Correa in 2007. Cristina Kirchner moved Argentina in an autocratic direction following her election as president in 2007. She undermined the independence of the central bank, appropriated private property, looted social security, manipulated government statistics,175 and in 2015 gave every appearance of having murdered the courageous prosecutor who was on the verge of indicting her for complicity in covering up the 1994 Iranian bombing of the Jewish center in Buenos Aires. Kirchner was ousted in the elections of November 2015 by the center-right Mauricio Macri. The Chavistas were defeated in Venezuelan legislative elections the following month, but forces of democracy had a considerable distance to go in Argentina and were routed in Venezuela. Some gains for democracy partly offset the numerous setbacks. For example, against a background of military dictatorship since 1962, President Thein Sein of Burma began easing his country’s authoritarianism and ending its seclusion in 2011. Far-reaching civil liberties were instituted, and the parliament was allowed to become independent and assertive. Relatively free elections were held in November 2015, and the opposition National League for Democracy (NLD) under Aung San Suu Kyi won a resounding victory, but the relationship between the parliamentary majority and the military was still to be resolved. Tunisia became partly democratic following its popular uprising, initiating the Arab Spring in 2011. Predominantly hierarchical Morocco also took steps toward democracy as did Singapore and Peru. The hierarchical regimes of the global era, weak or strong and from all traditions, were mostly bad ones with immoral, violent elites. Their rulers often fought their way to the top amid chaos and brutality and were eager to reap the precarious benefits of their literal or figurative coups. Democratic regimes may have declined only a little in the early 21^(st) century, but those that became more authoritarian, including Russia, China, and Turkey, were much more important than the few becoming more democratic. W hat Caused the Spread of Democracy? The Roles of Capitalism and cy around the world during the late 20th century, as in earlier periods, was the extraordinary spread of capitalism. Much of this influence came through the global shift to more rational-instrumental and less emotional-traditional ways of thinking and acting that accompanied the thriving economic markets.

Global capitalism habituated vast numbers of people to intense problem solving in everyday life, preparing them for and inclining them toward democratic decision-making. After one long copes with countless, varied instrumental challenges on a small scale in business, one is ready to cope with similar challenges on a large scale in politics. Becoming more tough-minded and critical as a result of exposure to capitalism’s ceaseless buying, selling, haggling, and taking of consequences from the same also predisposes citizens to democracy’s mechanical approach to collective decision-making and law enforcement. People new to the markets instead expect strong communal and consensual relations in their collective undertakings and recoil from the self-assertion, negotiation, and impersonalism of political markets. Such basic features of democracy feel unnatural to those with little exposure to capitalism. The experience of conducting business fosters alertness to and involvement in politics. Capitalism furthered the late 20^(th) -century democratization by contributing to the spread of political consciousness, in both its ideal and real forms, respectively political awareness and readiness to participate. Whether gained through experience in business or education, or to a lesser degree through the media or communal involvement, political awareness brings people within the range of democracy. Acquisition of the shrewdness, discipline, and disposition to act that capitalist experience confers also enables citizens to be steady when engaging in political action and efficacious about being heard. Political involvement by unaware and undisciplined recent migrants from rural areas tends to be episodic and inconsequent. Without more than intermittent political consciousness and weak competence, the third-world poor tended to be largely oblivious to politics, hopelessly out-maneuvered, and easily frustrated, unreliable supporters of democracy. Growing realism flowing from the economic markets also contributed to democratization. Without capitalist experience, the more or less unreconstructed aristocracies still influential in early 20^(th) -century hierarchical societies tended to be relatively idealist, as did their dependents. The oldstyle, ideologically oriented intellectuals176 numerous in those societies and the liberal societies of the time were idealist as well. As aristocracies and such intellectuals faded from the picture, idealism diminished. Global capitalism banished the leisure and contemplation that nourished those classes, leaving people riveted to the bottom line and here-andnow, nervously watchful and eminently practical. This realism promoted incrementalism and attention to feasibility helpful to democracy, while it discouraged flights of fancy and utopian visions dangerous to it. Realism was particularly helpful for democratic leaders, enabling them to fluently modulate policy as changing political conditions required. Capitalist realism undercut support for the chimerical goals that easily appealed to peasants, as in the Cuban Revolution, Chavez’s Venezuela, the Shining Path in Peru, and Maoist insurgents in rural India and Nepal.

Although eschewing the radical schemes of intellectuals is vital to democracy, moderate idealism balanced by pragmatism and restraint may be refreshing and inspirational for it. Increased individualism was another capitalist-derived source of democratization around the world. Where individuals have an affinity to democracy, members have an affinity to authoritarianism. Shedding collectivism in the course of coping with challenges in the economic markets helps prepare citizens for the political markets. As populations become more individualist, they acquire a greater need for autonomy, begin forming their own opinions, become more confident, and act more assertively. Being dictated to grates on those with long experience in business. As people engage in markets of all kinds, they break out of patron-client relationships and participate independently.177 The individualist, critical, take-charge monitoring of and participation in politics that are created and sustained by capitalist experience are vital to democracy. By contrast, the economic hierarchy in many parts of the third world and growing economic hierarchy in much of the first world militate toward collectivism, fatalism, and passivity, favoring authoritarianism. Even the democratic Japanese have retained enough collectivism to feel that they cannot make a personal difference politically. This is part of why democracy in Japan, although genuine, has been somewhat hampered and its political markets less than fully competitive. Japanese voters embedded in persisting informal structures require a long time and many reversals before they turn to another political faction, much less to a different party from the one in power. This hesitancy helped impart sluggishness to their democratic politics. The tendency was to fall in with the consensus rather than stand up to authority and assert oneself. The elements of authoritarianism carried into Japan’s democracy have largely been functions of the unusual workedness and homogeneity of traditional Japanese society, and therefore of its continuing strength of community and consensus. Westerners, with longer capitalist experience, have tended instead to be highly individualist and to feel relatively socially and politically empowered. The stormy opposite to Japanese politics in these respects would be Israeli politics with its turbulent groupings and loyalties amid deep individualism and frayed consensus.

More perfect political competition, freer political markets, and the formation and dissolution of political factions readily take place in Israel, Palestinian participation aside. The shift from authoritarian toward democratic personalities going on in much of the world during the late 20^(th) century also contributed to democratization. Whether a society’s modal character is authoritarian or democratic makes a major difference in what political regime it gets. A democratic or open personality leans toward relationships involving give and take with others, where an authoritarian or closed personality leans toward imperiously giving orders or, when subordinate, toward unquestioningly following them. Those whose character is democratic are tentative and critical, leaving room for others. Those whose character is authoritarian leave little room for others and expect little themselves. A democratic personality goes with tolerance and an authoritarian one with intolerance. Where the personalities of Americans, British, Canadians, Australians, Netherlanders, Swiss, and Israelis tend to be democratic, those in Muslim countries tend to be authoritarian, variations in propensity that are largely produced by exposure to markets as opposed to hierarchies, including political and religious ones. Part of what occurs in democratization is that democratic personalities slowly supersede authoritarian ones. As this transformation takes place, individual persons change comparatively little, and most of what occurs happens by generational succession. Democratization is messy and takes time to consolidate in part because character change leads, accompanies, and confirms regime change. Another important route by which capitalism promotes democratization is through increased prosperity, enabling countries to expand and upgrade their educational systems. Improved education contributes additional rationality, critical facility, awareness, discipline, and experience with which people lean more strongly toward and participate more fruitfully in democracy. Like greater experience in economic markets, increased education makes people bristle at being censored, interfered with, and dictated to. Education consists in large part of exposure to the cultural markets, familiarizing its beneficiaries with the give and take of ideas, aesthetics, and values, fostering tolerance. Lack of education was traditionally associated with proneness to personalistic/tribal ties, rigid expectations, absolute commitments, and dissatisfaction with democratic processes and outcomes. Without sufficient knowledge and critical facility, even the most dedicated citizens cannot become perspicacious regarding what their country, region, class, or group truly needs and cannot know how to contribute to it effectively. Without education, people have too little ability to get what they need, too much conflict along the way, and too little capacity to forestall would-be tyrants. Directly and indirectly, spreading capitalism equipped large numbers all over the world with the basic competence with which to participate in political markets, while growing government and economic monopolism have been countering the effect globally in this century.

Directly and indirectly, spreading capitalism equipped large numbers all over the world with the basic competence with which to participate in political markets, while growing government and economic monopolism have been countering the effect globally in this century. The Role of Universalism. Growing universalism also played a role in the democratization of the late 20^(th) century, though a mixed one. The more developed a people’s orientation toward the whole and the greater its wisdom and balance, the more likely their society is to democratize and the more successful the democracy. Universalism is particularly crucial in political leaders and seldom more so than with regard to their reasonableness and flexibility in accepting new entrants. When new classes demand inclusion in the collective conversation of democracy, established political classes may accede or attempt to suppress them. Increased universalism, breadth, and sensitivity, together with norms of inclusion, underlay the acceptance of the middle and lower classes, women, and ethnic and religious minorities into democratic political systems all over the world. Brazil’s recent history exemplifies the pivotal role of statesmanship in consolidating and developing democracy. Presidents Fernando Cardoso and Luiz Lula da Silva, of the right and left respectively, generally proved good stewards of their country from 1994 through 2010, following responsible economic policies and pragmatic, conciliatory social ones. The bulwark against special interests is stronger and corruption (in the weak sense of official self-dealing) reduced when a relatively universalistic leadership predominates, as in the United States during the national era. The bulwark is weaker and corruption increased when less universalistic politicians dominate as they did (with important exceptions) in this country from the late 1960s and especially from the early 1990s. Democracies shine in settings of moral strength and disappoint in settings of moral weakness. A key manifestation of universalism favoring democratic development is attainment of morally assertive respect for self and other, such that citizens courageously stand up for themselves and their fellows, demand high ethical standards in politics, and expect the same of others. Insofar as this moral assertiveness is developed, citizens become attuned to the moral status of their regime and firm in dealing with it. The more ethically developed are citizens, the more outraged they become at illegitimate authoritarian rule, and the more they strive to obtain self-determination for the basic self-respect it brings. Corazon Aquino’s 1986 uprising in the Philippines was largely fueled by outrage at Ferdinand Marcos’ reprehensible acts as dictator and by refusal to put up any longer with the corruption rampant under his regime.

Freedom of all kinds promotes such moral courage. Another manifestation of universalism important to democracy is elementary tolerance. Spared the ravages of economic markets, traditional community tends to be accompanied by strong identification with the group and intolerance toward other groups. Those immersed in such community easily take the acceptance of difference as betrayal and fall into conflict in its presence, jeopardizing democracy. As groupbound peasants and villagers are transformed into rulebound bourgeois whose commitments are abstract and who learn to distinguish law and morality from the somewhat arbitrary ways of their community, the prospects for democracy greatly improve. Tolerance facilitates the airing of difference in a spirit of working together rather than of division. At the lower end of prospects for democracy are found narrow, irascible, resentful, little-developed peoples for whom tolerance is anathema, as in Pashtun Afghanistan and the tribal areas of Pakistan. As John Stuart Mill says, “a rude people, though in some degree alive to the benefits of civilized society, may be unable to practice the forbearances which it demands: their passions may be too violent, or their personal pride too exacting, to forego private conflict, and leave to the laws the avenging of their real or supposed wrongs.”178 Democracy fails when hatreds and divisions are too intense. Hence, the rarity of democratization under the Islamic Resurgence. Democracy did not get far in Egypt in large part because the Muslim Brotherhood showed no inclination to grant recognition to Muslims of liberal faith, much less to adherents of other faiths. Most such deficiencies of tolerance stem from inexperience in economic, social, and cultural markets, but they also may from elite hubris. Whether provoked by radicalism, intolerance, personal authoritarianism, or elite arrogance, high levels of conflict and violence inflame divisions and intensify group identification. Peace and prosperity, to the contrary, ordinarily foster tolerance and reconciliation. Poorly developed countries without clear sovereignty or effective central administration often encounter such widespread turmoil and insecurity that democracy is difficult to sustain. People who might otherwise be disposed toward democracy may become desperate enough in the face of intimidation and fear that they are willing to throw themselves into the arms of strong men who promise the restoration of security, however objectionable their rule might be on other counts. India’s traditional universalism, tolerance, and relative peacefulness made it a comparatively strong candidate for democracy even though until recently its low levels of development and literacy worked against democracy.

India’s caste system long reduced class conflict by splintering most possible social bases of large, threatening division,179 although conflict with Muslims and Sikhs outside the Hindu system was an ongoing concern. India’s long colonial relationship with Britain also favored its democratization. India learned a great deal from the British and benefitted from the relative mildness of their colonial administration overall. The Roles of the Demonstration Effect and Democratic Culture. A key draw of democracy around the world during the late 20^(th) century was that its performance politically, economically, and in terms of self-respect gained, was in many cases compelling. Open-minded people everywhere plainly observed the effectiveness of the United Kingdom and United States’ strong economic and political recoveries from the doldrums of the 1970s and of their military buildups in response to the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. Neither the Soviet nor the Cuban dictatorship was able to come close to matching those Anglo-American achievements. America’s enviable economic performance continued through the 1990s. People were concluding even in authoritarian societies that democracy was efficacious, civilized, and attainable if citizens would stand up collectively against and overthrow the hierarchies stifling them. Much of the strength of democracy’s demonstration effect at the time hinged upon the leadership of Margaret Thatcher and Ronald Reagan, backed by the moral strength of the peoples who had formed and elected them. It was noticed as well in looking around the world that democracies do not suffer famines, even when they are poor.180 Democracy also gained charisma and won wide acceptance through the creation and dissemination of richly developed pro-democratic ideas along with an entire culture of democratic thought, slogans, and images via the mass media. This supporting culture emphasizing freedom and human rights facilitated the spread of democracy as its economic analog facilitated the spread of capitalism. The cachet of democracy played a large role in freeing the Eastern European Soviet dependencies for self-determination and helping most become solidly democratic. Democracy trounced dictatorship in the war of ideas and images during the late 20^(th) century. For a time, democratic culture shamed most of the world’s brooding corporals, crime bosses, larcenous gamers, and other actual and potential tyrants. For a time, authoritarian regimes nearly all had the same central problem as did the Soviet Union: How to survive politically in opposition to a world dominated by economic, political, social, and cultural markets, given the many-sided development and strength flowing from these markets, when under responsible leadership. However, both the demonstration effect and the culture became distinctly less favorable to democracy during the 1990s, as the great generation", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634243384_cleaned.txt:103:da37bd8df4d6", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 1293, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634243384_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634243384", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634243384_cleaned", "chunk_index": 104, "text": "corporals, crime bosses, larcenous gamers, and other actual and potential tyrants.

However, both the demonstration effect and the culture became distinctly less favorable to democracy during the 1990s, as the great generation was being displaced by the 1960s generation. The Roles of the Pax Americana and NGOs. Another master source of democratization was the Pax Americana, directly through the United States’ wielding of power and the prestige drawn from its successful exercise and indirectly through the global capitalism the security regime made possible. It is not a coincidence that there were ten times more democracies in the world in the year 2000 than there had been in 1941. Over and above its exercise of soft power, the United States interceded overtly and/ or covertly to help bring about a good deal of the democratization that took place. It intervened in Chile, the Philippines, Nicaragua, El Salvador, Iraq, Ukraine, and Libya, among many other countries. It also blocked numerous military coups against democratic regimes.181 That Great Britain had not been in a sufficiently strong position under the Pax Britannica to intervene much in continental Europe during the 19^(th) century is part of the reason democratization had been slow to nonexistent then.182 Insofar as democracies are more powerful militarily than autocracies, democratization occurs; insofar as the opposite holds, democratization reverses. An additional source of democratization was the building of civil society during the late 20^(th) century. The greater the public involvement in independent political organizations, the better prepared a country is for democratization. Political organizations, whether interest groups, neighborhood bodies, or movements and organizations of the concerned, represent empowered, engaged collectivities of democratic citizens. One of the secrets to India’s vibrant democracy was its rich civil society, which at the turn of the 21^(st) century consisted of a panoply of more than a million NGOs (non-governmental organizations).183 As Diamond argues, “A spirited civil society plays a vital role in checking and limiting the potential abuse of state power, but it also sustains and enriches democracy. Civil society organizations provide channels, beyond political parties and electoral campaigns, for citizens to participate in politics and governance, to air their grievances, and to secure their interests.”184 From the 1990s, a subset of NGOs matured whose purpose was to promote democratization internationally, much of it through the nurturing of civil society. Staffed by revolutionaries with velvet gloves, these NGOs formed an infrastructure for democratization that moved from country to country. As in funding by USAID (the U.S. Agency for International Development), “international assistance to civil society is helping to build the civic architecture of free and pluralistic society”", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634243384_cleaned.txt:104:01e1c65aed39", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 1294, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634243384_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634243384", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634243384_cleaned", "chunk_index": 105, "text": "to air their grievances, and to secure their interests.”184 From the 1990s, a subset of NGOs matured whose purpose was to promote democratization internationally, much of it through the nurturing of civil society.

As in funding by USAID (the U.S. Agency for International Development), “international assistance to civil society is helping to build the civic architecture of free and pluralistic society” in many countries.185 NGOs worked effectively in the Balkans during the 1990s and spectacularly so in Ukraine’s Orange Revolution of 2004. International NGOs’ maturing technology for nurturing civil society around the world significantly assisted in bringing about democratization between 1989 and 2004. Why Did Authoritarianism Falter in Late-20th-Century in Russia and China? Many authoritarian regimes faltered during the late 20^(th) century because democracy decisively won the contest for acceptance. At the apogees of the USSR during the mid-1930s and following the Allied victory in World War II, there was great loyalty to the Soviet regime within the Communist Party, if considerably less in the general public. Had that level of commitment been maintained within the party, communist rule would have continued irrespective of changes in public opinion. But by the late 1960s, the nuclear physicist Andrei Sakharov, in Progress, Coexistence, and Intellectual Freedom,186 offered the hope of convergence and harmony between East and West. I listened to visiting delegations of Soviet scholars at the time privately tell their American peers that communism was “stale bread” which no one any longer took seriously. By the 1980s, the Soviet regime had almost no legitimacy left in anyone’s eyes, even those of the apparatchiki running it. The Communist Party’s inability to halt the increasing awareness of the appeals of a Western way of life was a growing problem for the post-Stalinist Soviet regime. Its peoples were exposed to the power of liberal Western culture through contacts with Westerners and through the media, cumulatively eroding acceptance of the totalitarian regime. The West’s freedom of movement and expression, its restraint and decency, its movies and music, not to mention its endless supplies of housing and automobiles and shimmering images of Levi’s jeans, Pepsi, and the beach were simply overpowering to a system that could offer little beyond the fulfillment of basic subsistence. The unhindered debate and give and take of democracy were more and more appealing to those under Soviet tyranny. Just as democratic culture overpowered most third world hierarchical traditions, it overpowered Soviet cynicism. The East Bloc’s empty department stores, sterile apartment towers, and menacing border guards stood for the despair of a captive way of life. The regime crisis in the USSR began in part as the newly capitalist Asian countries’ huge economic success sank in.187 It was one thing when Soviet subjects struggled while the West flourished, but the disappointment hit home", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634243384_cleaned.txt:105:2030064afe4d", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 1295, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634243384_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634243384", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634243384_cleaned", "chunk_index": 106, "text": "appealing to those under Soviet tyranny.

The East Bloc’s empty department stores, sterile apartment towers, and menacing border guards stood for the despair of a captive way of life. The regime crisis in the USSR began in part as the newly capitalist Asian countries’ huge economic success sank in.187 It was one thing when Soviet subjects struggled while the West flourished, but the disappointment hit home once the West was joined in economic, political, social, and cultural vibrancy by any number of Asian upstarts. The collapse in Afghanistan put enormous additional pressure on the already widely detested and brittle Soviet regime by further discrediting it, although that alone was not sufficient to bring down the regime. Through his policies of glasnost and perestroika, Gorbachev introduced the Soviet Union and its dependencies to political freedoms they had never known, leading to an exhilarating but volatile release of hopes, to movement toward free elections in Russia and Eastern Europe, and collapse of the Soviet regime. Yet the strength of anti-democratic elements militated against democratization in Russia. Serious political reform, while it maintained coercive control over a hostile empire, had to begin with the freedom of Eastern Europe and domestic republics whose citizens were unwilling participants in the Soviet empire. Only once the USSR shrank toward its natural political community could there be much cutting back of coercive control agencies and allowing of free discussion and free association. Absent either the rule of law or mutual respect and trust among Russians in the wake of Soviet demoralization, the hope for democratization proved unfounded, even with security forces reduced. Russia’s turbulent gesture in the direction of democracy under Yeltsin soon abandoned all but transparent pretense and reverted to full authoritarianism and kleptocracy under Putin following the FRS coup in 2000. Putin and the secret police have ruled Russia since, curtailing civil liberties and coercing opposition.188 China’s authoritarianism was challenged in 1989 because there was considerable support for the democratic movement among the upper and middle classes and urbanites, including some in the Communist Party. It was nevertheless suppressed, primarily because decisive elements within the party have had no intention at any point to abandon hierarchical rule unless forced to do so. They included hardliners in the Red Army and other security forces, a mostly invisible element within the regime at the time of Tiananmen. They grew stronger, more confident, and less invisible later. The democracy movement was suppressed as well because some in the ruling class, who might otherwise have been sympathetic, felt the students’ democratic thrust to be premature given the large percentage of the country still rural. Problems were also raised by the student movement’s association with popular concern for social justice in a manner that threatened to reverse the country’s economic liberalization.189 As David Ignatius says, “among", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634243384_cleaned.txt:106:38ef619f226d", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 1296, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634243384_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634243384", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634243384_cleaned", "chunk_index": 107, "text": "the time of Tiananmen.

Of the world’s major religions, Islam has been the most authoritarian from the beginning, due to its origins in nomadic, warlike herding societies and early domination by warrior ruling classes. Conquering those in or near deserts and steppes set Muslim societies up for invasion, depredation, and the same in turn by others. Ibn Khaldun describes the continual churning of the Maghreb through centuries of conquest and reconquest.191 Living in dangerous neighborhoods, so to speak, meant comparatively little experience of peaceful reconciliation and its fruits. Islamic civilization has had relatively little chance to work through difference and develop traditions of trust, harmony and tolerance characteristic of the more settled civilizations. The Middle East’s multiple impediments to democracy bear more than a little resemblance to Russia’s, rooted alike in deep legacies of desert and steppe vulnerability, devastation, and demoralization, including shared experience of terrible despoliation by the Mongols. Neither has been fertile ground for reasonableness. Islam’s authoritarianism has moderated to a degree in some places and times, as in most of Indonesia during the global era, but these have been exceptional. Islam’s deep authoritarianism has made it exceptionally difficult for Muslims to oust tyrants. Moreover, unlike the West, the Islamic world has never allowed a place for autonomous, secular culture, aside from confined technical knowledge. It has minimal acceptance of difference, no tradition of independent, secular criticism, women’s rights, and virtually no history of democracy. Not surprisingly given its comprehensive closedness, traditions of misrule go back many centuries in the Islamic world. It has long produced and continues to produce disproportionately much of the world’s tyranny. Out of this background, Muslim populations achieved their dangerous initial, mass political awareness during the global era amid the hubris of newfound literacy and limited education. Wearing religious blinders, tolerance was difficult to achieve.192 King Faruq’s hierarchical Egypt of the mid- 20^(th) century, moderated by traditional rule and fedayeen quiescence, showed much more tolerance of Coptic Christians, who were even allowed to hold high government posts, than do today’s Egyptians. Such arrangements were possible prior to the attainment of political consciousness by more than a few.

Such arrangements were possible prior to the attainment of political consciousness by more than a few. As Arabs began leaving the fields (for, after the conquests most were peasants) and gaining basic education steeped in the Muslim faith, their popular fervor and harsh ethnic-religious intolerance set the tone. The street was born. Uganda’s President Yoweri Museveni rightly says that democracy requires a sufficient middle class that has developed beyond a sole preoccupation with matters of ethnicity, which in the Muslim world is bound up with religion.193 Without much experience of economic or any other form of independence, no more than a small middle class could form. Among other things, the Islamic Resurgence expressed the birth cry of a people’s first political consciousness. Its arresting howl lies at the foundation of their coeval paradigm diametrically opposing every aspect of Western liberalism. Oil has also been central to contemporary Muslim authoritarianism, for Middle Eastern petroleum reserves have directly empowered autocratic rulers. As Diamond says, “When oil is a country’s dominant export … its people become clients, not real citizens.”194 When political elites control oil revenues, they need not consult with citizens on the use of government revenues. International aid often subsidizes authoritarian regimes and impedes democratization in a similar way. Nor do people have as much concern with how revenues are spent if they are not being taxed. As Samuel Huntington says, “no representation without taxation.”195 Eight hundred years ago, the framers of the Magna Carta understood that rulers are unchallengeable when financially independent. Muslim rulers’ oil industries have at the same time constituted dominant government sectors within their economies, subordinating the private sectors and containing their liberalizing effects. As is common in entrenched hierarchical economies, relatively few liberal and moderate rulers arose in the Muslim world during the global era because its upper-middle and solid middle classes were small and weak while its marginal middle and working classes were large and gaining in power. State-controlled oil pushes aside the free markets and curtails the human development that could help bring about a free and critical public. By strengthening bad hierarchical regimes and subsidizing economic dependency, Middle Eastern oil has been a curse for political development as it also has been for economic development. Of the 23 economies in the world most dependent upon oil production in 2010, not one was democratic.196 Deliberate manipulation of ethnic-religious sentiments to sidetrack publics and secure a false, shallow, partial acceptance was also central to the Islamic political authoritarianism of the global era.

A great many Muslim countries are undemocratic today because their threatened elites were able to scapegoat outsiders, domestic and international, subsidizing hatred and intolerance to retain power. Muslim hierarchical regimes long milked the goat of the Arab-Israeli conflict to inflame religious bigotry and deflect attention from domestic devastation and toward Israel and the West. Middle Eastern autocrats’ manipulation of radical Islam resembles fascist dictators’ manipulation of nationalism in early 20^(th) -century Europe. It also resembles the Chinese regime’s increasing reliance upon nationalism for support, which it intermittently wields with intensity when it wishes to growl at the United States or its neighbors. Playing viciously on nationalist sentiments has been a standard gambit of hierarchical ruling classes since the French Revolution. The Saudi regime survived with comparatively little overt repression by liberally and strategically spreading its oil money around and frequently invoking its special status as protector of the Muslim holy sites and benefactor of Islam. Gerontocratic Saudi rulers put this policy in sharp relief by cynically sponsoring fundamentalist Wahabism, giving their regime favorable domestic PR while quietly propagating and supporting jihad around the world. The Saudi monarchy long bought the silence of its coopted subjects even though most of them failed to accept the regime for decades. As the Islamic Resurgence gained force from the 1970s and 1980s, many relatively secular Muslim regimes worked out modi vivendi with fundamentalists resembling those of the Saudis. Egypt’s Mubarak regime, for example, jailed fundamentalists who worked against it while tolerating and even supporting those who curtailed their domestic political activities. Such contortions long kept the regime relatively secure while enabling the Muslim Brotherhood to grow in strength. Syria’s Assad regime coldly employed a similar strategy until its citizens began trying to take matters into their own hands in 2011. The Jordanian monarchy, an exceptionally good regime, has been balanced and restrained overall; but it has been unable to fully include or win much acceptance from the restive, conflictual Palestinian community making up most of its population. The Dynamics of Democratic Performance in the Third World. When the ability and determination of pro-democracy forces reach a high pitch, people become ready to stand up to authoritarianism. Once prepared, they tend to rise up when hierarchical regimes falter and reel, discredited in times of crisis. This occurred early in the Arab Spring. The Tunisian uprising, for example, was sparked when an official wrongfully destroyed the livelihood of a simple peddler, who then immolated himself in protest.

In such cases the new order fights to liberalize, and the old order resists. The balance often tips from hierarchy to democracy in dramatic regime crunches in which popular indignation and empowerment surge past barriers and topple the old structures. These lurches have frequently been comparatively peaceful transformations in which portions of the hierarchical elite defect to democracy. Yet there is no easy and entirely gradualist route into democracy, nor is there usually an entirely peaceful one. A whole society or substantial part of it becomes self-governing all at once when restrictive rule yields to inclusive participation that is inherently less practiced. Inevitably the transition to self-determination is a bumpy one in which steps are taken both forward and backward, as is the case when a child comes of age or employees buy out a corporation. Nor was the path easy when democracy was being established in Europe and the United States in past centuries. Both sides make mistakes, small and large. Sometimes, as in Taiwan, the transition is decisive, with the old regime’s resolution shattered and the new structures sufficiently serviceable that no large reversals followed. In other cases, as in Ukraine, there were reversals in which the authoritarians in turn were able to discredit the nascent democratic structures, often by channeling frustration about mistakes and corruption, sometimes by exploiting nationalist sentiment, and not infrequently by outside interference. Once citizens gain liberty and democracy, they must be continually vigilant and ready to defend them with their lives and property if they wish to keep them. Societies whose citizens are ever prepared to take at once to the streets in outrage and overwhelming numbers to decisively face down usurpers are societies whose democracies are secure. That requires the tough-minded, confident populations which only capitalism delivers and education confirms. Malaysia, during the global era, presented an example of a mixed, partly free regime. Its citizens, though in many respects ready for democracy, were not yet able to reliably stand up to and remove high-handed, overbearing officeholders. Unscrupulous, majority Barisan Nasional (BN) party politicians played upon the insecurities of majority ethnic Malays in competing with minority Chinese and Indians, enabling the party to subvert the rule of law and govern continuously for more than five decades.

Malaysia’s long-serving Prime Minister Mahathir bin Mohamad, although doing some constructive things for the country, fomented division and suppressed opposition. He viciously traduced reformist Deputy Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim and imprisoned him for years. Police violence toward peaceful protestors demanding fair election procedures took place in 2011 amid continued baseless legal persecution of Anwar and his opposition party supporters. Although incomes and education greatly improved in Malaysia, an unevenly critical and independent voting public struggled to govern itself amid salient ethnic and Muslim religious identification.197 Democracy may also be jeopardized when security forces have high levels of corruption. Mexico achieved important democratization while undergoing respectable economic development for more than three decades, but it bore a major burden of corruption, one that particularly plagued law enforcement and increasingly the military as the latter became more involved in maintaining domestic order. Overcoming official lawlessness was central to Mexico’s halting democratization. The spread of large-scale narcotics trafficking was a major setback as vast sums of drug cartel money corrupted elected and appointed officials at all levels. Rogue elements in and associated with the government sanctioned violence and hobbled Mexican democracy by the 21^(st) century. The incorruptible few among elected representatives, administrators, judges, police, and journalists risked their lives, and many were assassinated. Reducing intimidation of and by corrupt security forces, officeholders, and union bosses was crucial to building trust and empowering democratic elements. Unlike the Mexican democracy, the Costa Rican democracy was one of the most robust in Latin America, in part because it had no military for most of the last century and developed under the umbrella of U.S. security. Flourishing capitalist relations and limited coercion by the state promoted a peaceful way of life favorable to democratization in Costa Rica. A key political challenge in Latin American democracies, as in most others, was a shortage of the critical facility to notice corrupt elements and of the moral fiber to stand up to them. When voting publics are insufficiently critical, informed, or engaged, and public outrage is ill focused and vulnerable to manipulation, such arbitrary decisions may be forthcoming that democracy becomes untenable. The burden of corruption, demagoguery, or strife may become so great and unremitting in an ineffectual democracy that people are better off under authoritarian rule, at least insofar as a good hierarchical elite is available.

Cruder forms of official self-dealing may be found in most third-world democracies than people would be willing to put up with in the first world, but no citizens are one hundred percent vigilant. Westerners have a difficult time understanding that more people around the world believe they are ready for democracy than actually are. Thinking that one’s compatriots or group ought to be allowed to participate politically does not guarantee the wisdom of that appraisal, for there is such a thing as false political consciousness in which a people or group judges itself better prepared to participate constructively than it is. This was the case with many third-world peoples when they gained autonomy from colonial states, as it is when many thirteen-year-olds believe that they are prepared for independence. Those who are less developed may sometimes be thrown off by the culture of the more developed within a society, and people of less developed societies may sometimes be thrown off by the political or social ways of more developed societies. Having picked up fragments of democratic culture for which they are not ready, it is difficult for many who need good traditional elites to any longer accept them, sometimes with tragic consequences. Why the Decline of Democratic Performance in the United States? Congressional restriction of the executive branch following Watergate was a major structural change that weakened American democratic performance. Under the circumstances, as John Marini says, a Democratic Congressional majority was able to infringe upon the authority of the presidency and increasingly reappropriate portions of the executive branch to itself. Since regulated companies were motivated to influence their regulation, Congress acquired a large pipeline to the special interests from its new authority. Its encroachment into the executive led to Congress’s redefinition of its purview from legislation to the executive oversight of regulatory activity. Democratic members of Congress gained the major benefit, but Republican members were included in the benefits and went along with the change.198 Congress formed a tacit coalition with the courts by offering them an expanded role in interpreting the often deliberately vague associated laws. Under the new system, according to Marini, “Congress controls the administrative details of politics through the bureaucracy it created, and the judiciary reigns supreme in the realm of politics or regarding general policy matters…”199 Yet the hobbling of the executive weakened that branch’s ability to bring coherence and discipline to national politics as well as the power of voters to monitor and shape politics through presidential elections.

This topic comes up again in chapter 8. Whether in the first or third world, democratic performance tends to be high to the extent to which public oversight and access are strong. The growing scale and remove of government in the United States made it increasingly difficult for its citizens to control. Some of the effect arose from the increased complexity accompanying large government and some of it from the geometrically increased density and strength of the special interests accompanying the increased scale. The media conferred additional advantage upon large, well-organized, well-funded special interests. The relatively high political interest and involvement of the national era declined because political gamers were running circles around average citizens, weakening their oversight and effectiveness. Many of the latter lost confidence that they could make a difference. Middle- and working-class voters often found political competition with the gamers and special interests too fruitless and exasperating to keep trying. The lowering of educational standards also considerably weakened public oversight. More than a little of the decline in participation was also simple refusal of the obligations of democratic citizenship, presenting self-dealing analogous to that carried on by unworthy public officials. The gamers’ moral decline was also alienating. Increasingly blatant manifestations of contempt by gamer officials, political operatives, and staffers toward their fellow Americans – as in egregious expressions of it by Angelo Mozilo, Jim Johnson, Rod Blagojevich, Jonathan Gruber, Benjamin Rhodes, and the Clintons – inflamed public ire. Those in and around politics became slipperier as well as smarter, and they wore down larger numbers of voters who hoped for better.200 It became more difficult to compete successfully in the political markets as it became more difficult to do so in the financial and labor markets. In the absence of effective oversight or morality, politicians and officials mostly became brokers for the special interests, seeking personal benefits rather than looking out for society or their constituents.201 Since few who gained political power during the global era were concerned with the well-being of society, the quality of American governance declined steeply. Poor democratic performance lay behind the Great Recession as the public well knows, and there was frequent grumbling and sporadic outrage by good but overmatched citizens about the fact.

When democratic citizens lack the resources or stamina needed to exercise oversight, and elites abandon their morality, special interests weasel into the expanding areas of opacity. The Etiology of a Class Struggle. The political division of the second half of the global era arose in large part because factionalized, paradigm-bearing cohorts were marching their way through the age structure. A revolutionary generation became politically engaged during the 1960s. The baby-boomers and their successors began coming to power in the 1980s but especially the 1990s. The 1960s generation had no recollection of the teamwork and sacrifice that were general during World War II, or of the postwar swell of gratitude for the many who had served their country. Having come of age fighting entrenched societal norms over civil rights, elders over moral restrictions, the government over Vietnam, and draft boards over conscription, its formative experience was of domestic rather than international conflict. Two social classes and character types, gamers and the middle class, vied for political and sociocultural preeminence in considerable tension with each other during the global era: A large majority of gamers, over-represented in the upper reaches of government, the professions, the media, and among intellectuals, was at war with the middle class. A minority of gamers, over-represented in business and the clergy, was supportive of the middle class. Although somewhat split vis-à-vis economic markets, the gamers were radically libertarian vis-à-vis sociocultural markets. The cultural content they thrust into the media offended and disturbed many in the middle class and corrosively affected young people. Led by the few sympathetic conservative gamers, many in the middle class responded to the frontal assault on their character and way of life by rejecting their liberal gamer tormentors and a great deal that was associated with them. A bitter, asymmetric class struggle took place during the global era over which of the two classes should set the sociocultural parameters. The gamers’ self-centeredness and provocativeness aggressively challenged the middle class. Socio-culturally naïve, outflanked, and treated mercilessly, many in the middle class found no other way to defend themselves than via populist, know-nothing anti-intellectualism carried over from fundamentalist Christianity, some of it overtly aggressive, some merely passive-aggressive. With powerful and threatening new elites arrayed against them, precarious members of the middle class had to grit their teeth and willfully push ahead against the tide.

The frequent failure of top conservatives to match the nimbleness of top liberals was partly responsible for conservatives falling behind liberals in American political competition from the early 1990s. The global-capitalist economy was not only a central source of the gamers’ higher discipline but also strengthened the middle class’s basic discipline, as had the early-capitalist economy. The arrival of global economic markets and departure of protected national ones exposed to sharp competition most of those who were once cushioned from capitalism by industrial and professional associations, unions, tariffs, and fair-trade laws. The icy waters of the global markets forced people to hustle unremittingly to find work, obtain clients, sell services, and perform myriads of adaptive chores amid gnawing uncertainty, which was just the prescription for instilling and strengthening discipline. The immersion of workers in the global markets swiftly rendered many of them middle class and conservative on economic issues although they remained less educated, resistant to the sociocultural markets, and relatively conservative on social issues. On the other hand, a great deal of global-liberal culture undermined discipline. Adults’ superegos were reinforced in the economic markets, but children were largely sequestered from these, while being dropped into the sociocultural markets. Other than through the effects of the market economy, American society was not good at lifting people into the middle class or keeping them there. One of the two elite bastions of the radical relativism anathematic to the character of the middle class was the culture industry of intellectuals, artists, and the media, which was dominated by gamers whose attacks upon the superego and animus toward the conservative reaction undermined the middle class. Many in the therapy community were especially antagonistic toward middle-class discipline. As the therapy community waxed, its gamers’ higher reflexivity leagued together with the id, celebrating release and denouncing restraint. The cosmopolitan, liberal gamers far outpaced the provincial middle class, while the latter plodded along as well as they could, mostly on their own. Some of the delay of the conservative reaction was because of the perennial lag in the supply of conservative ideas owing to the dearth of conservative intellectuals. The other elite-dominated institution anathematic to the middle-class discipline was the judiciary. The courts introduced sociocultural laissez faire the likes of which the modern world had never before witnessed.

The judiciary legalized homosexuality, abortion, and nearly all nonviolent forms of lifestyle or expression: It removed a great many restrictions from public school curricula. It nearly dissolved the earlier relatively mild censorship of pornography and the grossly offensive in magazines and books, and it greatly relaxed restrictions on movie and television content while reversing the traditional protections for Christianity. This judicial liberalization sowed confusion and consternation in the middle class. The reaction was unable to halt libertarian judicial rulings or counter the era’s sociocultural corrosion. The Democratic Party of the era was dominated by progressive gamers dissembling to group-member, single-women, aid-recipient, and protected, dependent-employee constituents such as those in government and monopolistic business. The Republican Party was dominated by conservative gamers representing middle- and working-class constituents. They dissembled as well to some degree, as in listening and nodding to Christian conservatives talking gibberish about evolution or stem-cell research. Gamers closer to the cultural than the economic markets – mostly those in and around the media and academia who were overwhelmingly progressive – tended to be skeptical and anti-middle class. These cultural gamers were for the most part employees of large organizations and buffered from economic competition. Gamers closer to the economic markets tended to be less skeptical and less unsympathetic to the bourgeois than their cultural counterparts, or sometimes sympathetic to them. Republican elites yielded to a degree to the party’s harried, middle-class rank and file. The relatively unified and concentrated liberal gamers of the two coasts were able to consolidate regional support from other classes for their leanings, but liberal gamers elsewhere in the country were able to do so only in pockets, albeit influential ones. Since most of the country was not sufficiently acclimated to the wide-open sociocultural markets to feel comfortable with extreme tolerance, much of it was fertile ground for the conservative reaction. In many parts of the country, the middle class pulled back from and opposed the liberal gamers, insulating themselves and going their middle-class way in opposition to them. Men were more likely than women to vote Republican during the later decades of the era largely because they were more likely to be close to the economic markets and less likely to be dependent employees. Their different occupational settings, together with the facts that women were less likely to follow their husbands’ political leads than they had been at mid-century, explain most of the gender gap.

Why the political stagnation of other first-world democracies? Like American democracy, European democracies became less able to make needed policy reforms through the global era because inherently monopolistic government was becoming larger, stronger, more bureaucratic, more entrenched, and more opaque; removing more and more areas of policy-making from parliamentary authority. Much of the problem in Europe derived from growth of the EU bureaucracy. The EU took control in many areas without fully operational and unified executive or legislative branches. The EU bureaucracy exuded an atmosphere of entitlement even stronger than that increasingly found in Washington. European citizens lagged in informing themselves and becoming engaged as government grew and became more complex and distant. Much as the rise of the nation-state displaced the estates of the Middle Ages through the 15^(th), 16^(th) , and 17^(th) centuries by exceeding the range of their democratic resources, the rise of the EU has displaced national European democracies by exceeding their range. Amid stronger persistence of high culture and liberal education, continental Europe’s leading classes remained somewhat more universalistic and in better harmony with their societies than those of the United States. Left-leaning European elites and upper and upper-middle classes triumphed socioculturally in a way they did not in the United States except on the two coasts, but those classes were less gamer, better integrated, more restrained, less provocative, and did not press their advantages as harshly and divisively as did their American counterparts. The European middle class for those reasons was less agitated and inflamed overall than the American and not as vehemently opposed to their elites. The aristocratic ridicule Molière once directed toward the bourgeois was still forthcoming in Europe, if often from convoluted, Marxist-influenced sources; but it tended to be relatively mild. There was less bludgeoning of the middle class with multiculturalism until the last decade of the global era. The continental middle class was long awed or lulled into modesty and silence. Unabashed, unsublimated, superego dominants may have been numerous in the United States or Britain but were less frequently found on the continent. However, the prolonged political paralysis, euro crisis, refugee crisis, and challenge of Islamism in Europe began awakening the middle classes and discrediting the elites. Japan’s robust, relatively hierarchical consensus thwarted efforts at democratic political reform, including those to modernize administration, instill responsiveness, and overcome corruption.

The force and recency of Japanese hierarchy and the continuing collectivism of its national character underlie this vulnerability. More developed democracies may have had less blatant and crude corruption than less developed ones, but subtle, refined corruption could be comparably debilitating. The global-era first world’s interested business subsidies, tax loopholes, regulatory lapses, unsustainable retirement programs, albatross medical systems, and burdensome monopoly grants to business and labor presented a vast swindling of populations by their politicians and the special interests swarming about them. The orchestrated lobbying, advertising, and PR services of the special interests were powerful indeed. To a considerable extent, what Aristotle said of demagogues applied to the engineers of mass opinion: “While the people rule over all, they rule over people’s opinion.”203 Why the Reversal of Democratization in the Early 21^(st) Century? The central cause of the cessation and slight reversal of democratization around the world during the early 21^(st) century was the declining political performance of first-world democracies from the 1990s. The world’s leading democracies performed effectively from the 1940s through the 1980s and inspired emulation, but they did not during the second half of the global period. The deterioration of democratic governance patently lay behind their mounting national security and economic troubles. When the flagship American democracy was severely short of leadership, and most of its governing class had come to brazenly disserve the American public, when the French, Italian, and Japanese democracies were paralyzed and British democracy was doing no better than so-so, who in the second or third world would think that becoming or remaining democratic was neccessarily advantageous? Opinion leaders around the world instead began paying new attention to the rising authoritarian countries of the time. A good deal of the late 20^(th) -century surge in democratization had come from the great generation, that of World War II, prominently including Ronald Reagan. George H. W. Bush, of the same generation, reaped much of the harvest and helped keep the momentum going. Bill Clinton, although of the new generation, reaped some of the accolades because of his global popularity. A changing of the guard occurred in all social classes. Those bearing the national-liberal paradigm cared about how the country fared, gave generously of themselves, and prided themselves in leadership and involvement. As the leavening presence of the World War II generation more rapidly receded by the end of the century, democratization plateaued and soon reversed.

Democratization also halted because the relatively easy and likely countries had already become democratic. When the Soviet Union collapsed, most of Eastern Europe was ready to democratize. Many of the remaining authoritarian countries were not, including nearly all Muslim countries. Democratization halted as well because while first-world democracies were hitting developmental walls under global liberalism, authoritarian regimes were innovating and upgrading. Why the 21^(st) -Century Strengthening of Authoritarianism? Much of the strengthening of authoritarianism during the later decades of the era occurred because rulers learned how to counter democratization, as is insightfully argued by Dobson.204 They were able to do so in part by camouflaging their regimes’ authoritarianism through subtle public relations to foil their domestic and international opposition. National-era dictatorships obtusely proclaimed what they were with fanfare and bluster. They trumpeted the superiority of authoritarian systems with propaganda based upon rigid ideology and ponderous, neo-classical symbolism. Everyone knew which regimes were democratic and which were authoritarian through the 1980s, with the exception of the Deng-regime China, but it soon became difficult to tell. Dictatorships that wanted to survive amid the global-era headwinds had to adopt a new modus operandi and PR strategy. Supporters of democracy now had to expend much effort in order to determine whether and to what extent elections, legislatures, and courts were shams. Dictators learned that if they veiled their rule and made it difficult for firstworld citizens and their own subjects to grasp the nature of their regimes, they hardened those regimes against their democratic adversaries. Doing so was an especially useful strategy when the authoritarian regime was new and more vulnerable. Such veiling played an important role in turning the political tide against democracy.205 The new authoritarianism also strengthened itself by upgrading its subversion. Putin’s Russia, for example, extensively subverted democratization in Ukraine, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Georgia, and other former Soviet dependencies, using secret agents to corrupt, defame, intimidate, or murder leaders. It used PR specialists to confuse publics, erode trust, poison sociocultural milieux, and sow discord. Putin and his agents brought about much of the terrible performance of Ukraine’s nascent democracy in the years following the Orange Revolution of 2004 – how much, may never be known. After losing Ukraine to democracy, Putin also began more vigorously countering the NGOs in that country and elsewhere. He severely restricted the international NGOs within Russia, as China also did.

While these NGOs made and continued to make large impacts around the world, their maturing social technology of democratization was now being contested and blocked in many countries. Since the Soviet Union had obstructed democratization on a global scale, ending its global subversion was one more way in which the Soviet collapse furthered democratization around the world. Russia’s aggressive interference in most of its former dependencies, as well as in Syria, Cyprus, Nicaragua, and many other countries, including even the United States, speaks of Putin’s resumption during the Obama presidency of his country’s global efforts to combat democratization. China, Saudi Arabia, and Pakistan also obstructed democratization internationally. Both the new veiling and the new subversion were effects of gamers reaching the top ranks in the major contemporary hierarchical societies, for gaming undercuts democracy and strengthens authoritarianism. Russia pioneered in the new treachery because that country came under the rule of a shrewd, wily, and dangerous gamer when Putin took over in 2000. Yeltsin was clever but volatile, erratic, and only partly gamer. Putin was a gamer through and through, one of the most sophisticated yet to rule an authoritarian society. Dismayed as he watched the East German and Soviet regimes collapse from his positions in the KGB, he contemplated the fundamental circumstances of authoritarian societies in the global era. Where the Soviet regime was bureaucratic, turgid, and cumbersome, and paid for it in economic lethargy, regime rejection, and collapse, the Putin regime was tactically nimble in many respects and strategically so in others. Putin was mindful of the need to stay lean and solvent in order to grow economically and increase state power. In his regime’s thinking, micro-management of its subjects went beyond the point of marginal return, needlessly running up costs. That was part of its logic in leaving the Internet relatively unrestricted. Doing so also had PR advantages. There were other, less expensive ways of handling the Internet, including the massive presence of regime trolls, propagandists spewing out terabytes of disinformation, slyly rendering it useless for democratization while discharging additional sinister regime assignments.206 Putin’s adept PR management was eminently gamer. Other less bold and cagey contemporary authoritarian regimes tended to be less gamer. China did not democratize in large part because of the lingering effects of the country’s long history of hierarchicalism, including deep-rooted collectivism and strong community and consensus.

China was able to liberalize economic markets while keeping its political markets closed because the weight of its past left deficits of tolerance and restraint, especially among the rural masses who made up nearly half the population. As part of their authoritarian sociocultural legacy, the Chinese, like the Japanese, continued to take critical questioning to be a sign of personal disrespect.207 Individualism remained anathema.208 A diminishing but still profound and widespread fatalism also hindered democratization. China’s experience with the economic markets was eroding the effects of millennia of hierarchy, and its young people increasingly felt indignant about censorship and hungered for democracy, but large numbers of Chinese remained manipulable by the nationalist appeals and sleight-of-hand of the determined, capable gamers in control of the levers of state power. Singapore enjoyed the rare good fortune of gifted, benevolent hierarchical rule. The Lee regime’s combination of unabashed autocracy and capitalism brought remarkable prosperity and a well-ordered society to Singapore. Yet the Lees’ extensive accommodations to the economic and social markets and excellent educational system argued for the transitional nature of their benevolent despotism, for they prepared a capable and prosperous population that would increasingly yearn for collective self-determination. The rarity of the Lees’ talent and benevolence also did. When less wise and less well-disposed successors arrive, as they must, so will increased pressure to democratize. The force of the liberal democratic society and culture to which young and urban Muslims were increasingly exposed was a major cause of the Arab Spring uprisings. Nearly all of the protesters were concerned about economic suffocation and injustice under corrupt and inefficient hierarchical regimes. Turkey’s economic growth from 1997 and democratization for a time helped inspire the Arab Spring. The Internet, cell phones, and other new forms of communication opened the insurgents to diverse cosmopolitan influences while enabling them to coordinate with each other and organize politically. The uprisings were suppressed, except in Tunisia, partly because the insurgents were relatively few in number and vulnerable to the machinations of brutal rulers. The larger problem was that the young freedom fighters were immersed in the sea of anger and intolerance of the Islamic Resurgence with its extreme nationalism. Even seeming moderates in the Muslim world overwhelmingly took for granted the assumptions of the reigning Muslim paradigm of the era. Not until that paradigm and its jihad were decisively defeated in hearts and on the ground could there be anything more than niche democracy in the Muslim world.

The global era’s developed democracies were, in many respects, impreswere to varying degrees balanced institutions ensconced in intricate legal, social, moral, and cultural frameworks. It had taken sustained effort over centuries for their citizens to become able to carry on prolonged peaceful, democratic conversations across wide, deeply felt divisions and abide by the electoral outcomes. Patterns of tolerance and civility and bonds of respect and trust had been built up in advanced democracies as difficult political oppositions were overcome, even as new ones continued to arise. Where many utterly ruinous regimes had ruled historically, many comparatively good ones existed during the global era. Nevertheless, much of this hardwon legacy eroded during the last quarter century of the period. The global era witnessed the gamers’ rise to political domination and the middle class’s political marginalization. The growing imbalance of power was strikingly evident in the way in which the gamers became part and parcel of the reign of the special interests. It also was in the consistency with which the gamers prevailed on the crucial issue of immigration. As Huntington says, the American public overwhelmingly supported tough enforcement of immigration laws, and only a small minority of Americans opposed such enforcement. But that minority was substantially made up of gamers who got what they wanted through presidential decree, Congressional maneuvering, judicial ruling, administrative action, culture industry spin, or any tactic they found useful.209 The changing power balance between the upper and middle classes presented a serious, many-sided challenge to American democracy. Many promising ways of strengthening democracy were available, including restricting money in politics. Competing in the wide-open political markets, the special interests had become too well organized, too big, too strong, too cynical, and too destructive, precisely as large corporations had in the unregulated economic markets of the late 19^(th) century. Under Citizens United and related rulings, neither party was able to overcome the large interests lying at the source of many of the country’s most serious problems. The Supreme Court was ready to go to the mat for economic laissez faire during the progressive era and again in the 1930s. From the late 20^(th) century it was ready to do so for political laissez faire. The principle of free speech for large economic interests was not without appeal, but look at the consequences! The large interests that undermined American democracy lacked all feeling and judgment, and their horizons were disastrously narrow.

Hayek says that individual human beings have some decency, but organized interests do not.210 Large organized interests may be legal persons, but they do not pass the test of citizenship. A second promising political reform was ending the obstructionist Senate filibuster. Abolishing it was a potential major step away from a gridlocked, bought-and-paid-for mechanism toward one again able to resolve the country’s problems. An anachronism from a bygone era of national and Congressional consensus, the filibuster was as inappropriate and destructive during the global era as had been the empowered British House of Lords prior to passage of the Reform Bill in 1832. The British were in a crisis of democracy then, and we were near one by the early 21^(st) century.211 Partisans should not have clasped onto the filibuster out of misplaced fear of what the other party might do when it was their turn to govern. They should have relished the challenge. Each party needs to be able to enact much of its program when it has the mantle and be judged by the results. Extricating itself from its many problems was going to be exceedingly difficult for the United States without reforming the political markets. All modern democracy has been founded upon alert, capable, numerous, and strong middle classes. The United States’ predecessors in modern democracy, the Netherlands and Great Britain, were so founded. The vibrant American democracy of the18th, 19th, and first two-thirds of the 20^(th) century was founded upon such a middle class. As middle classes ascended economically and socioculturally, they first checked their aristocracies, then substantially drew them toward middle-class political notions and leanings, and then consolidated their democracies. Even the proto-democratic estates and free cities of the Middle Ages were founded upon strengthening middle classes. The United States fought its bloodiest war to force the aristocratic, ante-bellum South into the middle-class world of liberty and democracy. Sadly, this country for the first time witnessed its middle class eclipsed during the global era and, not only unable to influence the new upper class of gamers, but encountering its contempt. As democratic citizens become more aware of their opportunities and mistakes, the tools are at hand with which to take advantage of the one and turn away from the other.

The mechanism with which to reform is always available in developed democracies. Governments, parties, and paradigms may be changed under democracies, but not under dictatorships, for they shoot the messengers. Only when citizens are incapable, indifferent, or suppressed do they have reason to despair over their futures. Authoritarian rulers may perform tolerably well for a time when uncorrected by critical opposition, but they eventually succumb to hubris and venality and bring down their societies. The wise embrace democracy, not thinking that it is a panacea but that it offers responsibility, dignity, and the use of a supple and authentic mechanism, if frequently slow and disorderly, for managing self-determination. Never had community been more market-based and less hierarchical on such a scale than it was in global-liberal societies. Kinship ties had played a far greater role in people’s lives in earlier societies when clan leaders, the extended family, or parents had chosen young people’s spouses; or, during the national era, when young people had selected them on their own but usually from restricted pools. Communal relations were freely sought and freely offered during the global era. The social markets became enormous – much thicker, in economic parlance – with free choices being made from among vast numbers and kinds offered. Community also frequently became global in reach with families and friendships extending beyond national boundaries and across the world. In earlier centuries, if a relative or friend migrated to another region, country, or continent, they were effectively lost to the group – not so during the global era. Those far apart were able to remain in close contact via relatively inexpensive means of swift transportation and communication. People traveled frequently and were more easily able make long-distance moves even as an increasingly large part of informal social life became bound up in the Internet’s universal transcendence of geography. As all of the traditions, subcultures, and ways of the world were brought into proximity with each other, tremendous local difference arose, and rapid mixing of groups occurred. First- and third-world peoples, Christians and Muslims, seculars and believers, hipsters and traditionalists had once been insulated from each other but were now cheek by jowl. Not only did the burgeoning real and virtual megalopolises of global-liberal societies mingle the peoples of the world, they also celebrated diversity. In a wonderfully apt expression, Williams termed the style of such diversity chaotic-exotic.212 From Community to Economy.

In a wonderfully apt expression, Williams termed the style of such diversity chaotic-exotic.212 From Community to Economy. Community was weakening and thinning almost everywhere during the global era as part of broader overall shifts from community to economy and from the emotional to the rational. As the instrumental and rational were entering into and mingling with community, they were both displacing it and marking that which remained with the rational signs of economy. More and more of the available community became embedded in or auxiliary to the economy. As people spend more time on the job, according to Putnam, community more often arises from work and among co-workers than in the past.213 Indeed, community was increasingly often incubated by economic entities such as corporations, nonprofits, and governmental agencies. Neither inherited from the past nor built by its members, such greenhouse community was spawned by entities having instrumental reasons for what they did. The elaborately orchestrated social activities within many large business firms, the industrially engineered informal groups in offices and manufacturing facilities, the internal marriages arranged by Japanese firms to facilitate solidarity, and the officially sponsored newcomers’ groups on U.S. military bases were all examples of such community. Matchmaking increasingly often took place via the Internet or meetings arranged by corporations for a fee rather than via relatives, friends, or churches. Group therapy was another form of artificial but useful community, one in which mental health clinics brought patients together to share their struggles and listen sensitively to each other. Hospitals sponsored similar support groups for cancer patients, their families, and survivors. Such arranged community may have been less spontaneous and less durable than the voluntary community in decline, but it was often both helpful and all that was left. What traditional community survived often grew up amid economy where it could, as living testimony to its displacement, like grass sprouting between slabs of concrete. Although adaptable and resilient, community, like nature, was severely strained. The Decline of Face-to-Face Community. The flourishing face-to-face community of national-liberal societies had provided a setting within which conviviality could enjoy a resurgence, one that in retrospect seems like a quaint luxuriance. Informal sociality of many traditional kinds receded rapidly during the global period. As Putnam says, “active involvement in face-to-face organizations … plummeted.”214 Social clubs were ubiquitous in the United States during the national era, and many people belonged to several of them. From the mid-1970s to the late 1990s Americans went from almost two-thirds going to club meetings, to two-thirds never doing so.

From the mid-1970s to the late 1990s Americans went from almost two-thirds going to club meetings, to two-thirds never doing so. Many kinds of social clubs once worked mightily alongside other institutions to weave good will into the fabric of society. Elite civic clubs, Masonic lodges, and Rotary, Kiwanis, and Lions community organizations of the national-era had such a purpose. Between 1975 and 1999, those who attended one or more club meetings per month declined by 58 percent. Between 1965 and 1995, those who spent any time in a community organization declined by 57 percent. Participation in league bowling collapsed during the late 20^(th) century, and with it a great deal of wholesome middleand working-class camaraderie.215 Steep decline of civic life continued throughout the period. Shared public space became noticeably less comfortable than it had been through the early 1960s. Casual chatting largely ceased between strangers on the street in cities and even in many towns as Americans were no longer able to enjoy the easy rapport with each other they once had. The automatic camaraderie of the national era among theatergoers lined up to purchase tickets disappeared.216 So jumpy did Americans become with each other that they often defensively said, “No problem,” when responding to a stranger’s “Thank you,” in place of the generous and open traditional, “You’re welcome.” Not surprisingly, friendship weakened during the global era and tended to become shallower, more reserved, and more easily let go. Americans spent less time visiting friends and more time alone. In 1985 only 10 percent of respondents reported that they had no one with whom to confide about personal troubles; by 2004, almost 25 percent did.217 Circles of closest confidants declined by approximately one-third. The numbers of those who could confide in no one but a spouse increased by almost 50 percent.218 Those who could confide in a neighbor fell more sharply, from about 19 percent to 8 percent during that nineteen-year period.219 Neighborhood ties fell by about 50 percent all together. By 1999 Americans were going on picnics about 60 percent less often than they had in 1975.220 Correspondingly, settings where people could easily socialize, like full-service restaurants and luncheonettes or taverns, bars, and nightclubs, decreased markedly in availability, while those where people could not easily socialize, like fast-food restaurants, increased markedly.221 The relatively lush sociality of the national era had largely collapsed by the turn of the century, though the more educated were much less socially isolated than the less educated throughout the period.222 Religious community is a master source of involvement from", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634243384_cleaned.txt:126:46ceac3c18ff", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 1316, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634243384_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634243384", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634243384_cleaned", "chunk_index": 127, "text": "they had in 1975.220 Correspondingly, settings where people could easily socialize, like full-service restaurants and luncheonettes or taverns, bars, and nightclubs, decreased markedly in availability, while those where people could not easily socialize, like fast-food restaurants, increased markedly.221 The relatively lush sociality of the national era had largely collapsed by the turn of the century, though the more educated were much less socially isolated than the less educated throughout the period.222 Religious community is a master source of involvement from which many other kinds of involvement spring, “Religious Americans [being] … up to twice as active civically as secular Americans.”223 Indeed, “nearly half of all associational memberships in America were church related, half of all personal philanthropy is religious in character, and half of all volunteering … [is] in a religious context.”224 This social involvement carried over into personal life, for “regular church attendees reported talking with 40 percent more people than others in the course of the day.”225 Many of the socially beneficial effects of religiosity arose through “religiously based social networks.”226 Like club membership, league bowling, and spontaneous public sociality, religious community greatly weakened from 1965. From a late 1950s peak, church attendance had fallen about 25 percent by the late 1990s.227 Involvement in church-related activities other than mere attendance fell even more, by about 50 percent.228 Community was uprooted and shocked to a far greater extent during the global era than it had been during the early- and national-liberal eras. By this century, the ravaging of community reached the point at which vital civic organizations and concerned citizens’ groups that monitor and correct important problems in government and society were sapped by alienation and apathy, resulting in markedly reduced effectiveness of American democracy. The Rise of Mediated Community. A great deal of community was also radically reformatted during the global era as strikingly new forms of community arose and proliferated. Instead of being heavily involved in faceto-face relations with families and friends, people became immersed in mediated relations. Relations with families and friends were increasingly carried on via mobile phone, Skyping, and instant messaging, sometimes in long-distance partnerships or marriages and often in other family relationships and friendships. A veritable bouquet of new informal sociality grew up around a rapidly evolving set of technologies, including email, Internet chatrooms, blogs, and social websites like Facebook and Twitter. People found partners and reconnected with lost friends through social websites. They interacted breezily in email communication, unconcerned about grammar, spelling, or typos, skipping words and whole phrases, confident that they were understood. They retreated from public spaces to their homes and apartments where they spent more time physically alone but wired into virtual space, encompassing those with whom they wanted to be connected. Or they were alone with others at bistros or on subways as electronic messages flowed in and out of their devices. As virtual reality became more salient,", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634243384_cleaned.txt:127:cbc21bc91c81", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 1317, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634243384_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634243384", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634243384_cleaned", "chunk_index": 128, "text": "They interacted breezily in email communication, unconcerned about grammar, spelling, or typos, skipping words and whole phrases, confident that they were understood.

Or they were alone with others at bistros or on subways as electronic messages flowed in and out of their devices. As virtual reality became more salient, great cities become neighborhood portals to the Internet’s all-encompassing presence. These changes in informal sociality were related to others in game playing. The games of the past, like cards, darts, board games, Ping-Pong, pool, and badminton were unmediated electronically. Now they became mediated, like Hitman, Grand Theft Auto III, Super Mario Galaxy, and GoldenEye 64. Although face-to-face sociality often accompanied video game–playing in such locations as crowded dorm rooms or large convention halls where all kinds of hooting and kibitzing transpired,229 many forms of face-to-face relations were rendered obsolete and rare, displaced by technology. Poker playing had taken place earlier around tables in smoke-filled rooms. Now it most often took place over the Internet between strangers scattered across the globe. Video games allowed physical solitaries to engage actively with others via technology. The transformation of community echoed the way in which retail stores were closing as people more often shopped via the Internet. The rise of virtual community partly – but by no means fully – offset the decline in face-to-face community. Even as new technologies increased the ease of communication, the community resulting from them was comparatively remote, and people were less interested in those around them, kept more to themselves, and felt lonelier. Three-quarters of a century after its arrival, television also still absorbed (or partly did) four and a half hours of American adults’ time per day as it droned on in one-way, often solitary communication.230 The widespread mediation of sociality compounded the sense of social alienation. Those woefully short of satisfying relationships with their fellow human beings turned increasingly to relationships with pets, directing sensitive perspicacity, deep emotion, subtle humanity, and formidable resources to them. Never had so many dogs received so much loving care and attention from women spurned by trolling men, singles ensconced in tomb-like apartments, and seniors abandoned by grown offspring – while so many children were left unattended, prey to all too many dulling or disruptive influences. Video security proliferated to protect the unattended child or pet, but it hardly lessened the isolation. The era’s increasingly tattered, minimalist, evanescent, and often mediated community left many feeling sad. The Disintegration of the Family. Change in community was nowhere more dramatic or profound in the United States than in the family.

The love and giving of husband and wife to each other and mother and father to their children were often no longer as unqualified as they once had been. Parents spent less time physically interacting with each other and their children, as the latter did with everyone else. The role of fathers in their children’s lives receded across most family types during the global era.231 Regular dining together of family members fell precipitously.232 Nor did children give back as they once had. Seniors could look forward to bureaucratic holding facilities in their last years. Asian immigrants to the United States were often shocked at the very existence of such facilities, much less their number and sometimes revolting conditions. During the 1950s the vast majority of families had been intact, divorce rare, fertility high, unmarried men and women seldom cohabiting, nonmarital births almost unheard of, and a large majority of children living with both biological parents. Sixty years later, most families were no longer traditional, divorce was widespread, fertility low, unmarried men and women often cohabiting, nonmarital births common, and a majority of children no longer living with both biological parents. In 1960, only 17 percent of American children lived away from their biological fathers; by 2013, 37 percent did.233 Women headed 14 percent of white families in 1983;234 they headed 25 percent by 2010.235 Nonmarital births soared from 5 percent to 41 percent overall between 1960 and 2012.236 Fifty-three percent of births to women under age 30 were outside marriage, a harbinger of things to come.237 Blacks underwent earlier and more extreme family disintegration than other Americans. Eighty-four percent of New York City black children had lived with both parents in 1925.238 Even during the Eisenhower years only 20 percent of black births had been nonmarital; in 1964 only 25 percent had been.239 By 2012, 73 percent of black births were nonmarital, while 53 percent of Hispanic and 29 percent of non-Hispanic white births also were.240 Blacks led the way, but family instability increased rapidly in all racial and ethnic groups throughout the period. If family disorganization was strongly conditioned by race and ethnicity, it was even more strongly conditioned by education. In 1960, 94 percent of white college graduates aged 30 to 49 and 84 percent of those with no more than high school diplomas had married. By 2010, 83 percent of college graduates had married but only 48 percent of the low education group.

By 2010, 83 percent of college graduates had married but only 48 percent of the low education group. The percentage of divorced or separated among white college graduates aged 30 to 49 who had ever married increased between 1960 and the early 1980s but held steady afterward at about 7 percent. Among the corresponding group with no more than high-school education, those divorced or separated had already reached that level by 1970 and soared afterward, reaching 33 percent by 2010.241 The nonmarital birthrates of college graduates diverged sharply from those of high-school dropouts. In 1971, the rates were approximately 1 percent for college graduates and 9 percent for high-school dropouts. By 2008, they were 5 percent for college graduates but more than 60 percent for high-school dropouts, with intermediate levels for those with some college and those with only high-school graduation.242 Americans of all education levels witnessed much increased family disorder from the beginning of the global era, but the disorder stabilized at relatively low levels for college graduates after 1980, while it continued to rise for the less well educated and reached catastrophic levels for those with no more than high-school education by the end of the era. That the United States had a higher divorce rate than other developed liberal societies, is well known.243 That it also had a higher marriage rate than they is not well known. More telling about the American family of the global era than either its comparatively high marriage or high divorce rate was the combination of the two. As Andrew Chernin said near the end of the era, “People partner, unpartner, and repartner faster [in the United States] than do people in any other Western nation. They form cohabiting relationships easily, but they end them after a shorter time…. In other words, having several partnerships is more common in the United States not just because people exit intimate partnerships faster but also because they enter them faster and after a breakup reenter them faster.”244 Women streamed into the labor force under global capitalism, moving from community into the economy. Only 15 percent of married women had been in the labor force in 1940, but 41 percent were by 1970, 58 percent by 1990, and 61 percent by 2010, as the phenomenon plateaued.245 At the same time, society peeled away most of women’s traditional activities by monetizing and/or mechanizing them. A variety of relatively dispensable food preparation and household chores were ceded to professionals or labor-saving appliances, but many vital social-emotional and moral sustenance tasks that women had traditionally performed in the family were also abandoned.

A variety of relatively dispensable food preparation and household chores were ceded to professionals or labor-saving appliances, but many vital social-emotional and moral sustenance tasks that women had traditionally performed in the family were also abandoned. Many household tasks also remained, unpaid, upon the shoulders of women, typically in addition to full-time jobs; while many others were curtailed. The substantial displacement of homemakers during the global era presented the second of the two most profound instances of the displacement of community by economy in all of history. (The first had come in traditional hierarchical societies as serfs abandoned subsistence farming to take paying jobs or start businesses in free cities or societies that welcomed them.) Women’s full-time homemaking constituted valuable communal activity outside the formal economy. Large numbers of national-era homemakers had also been able to devote considerable time to community outside the family, including its oversight. That too was substantially abandoned. Many such informal pairings were lifelong. Where children were present in this nuclear-family pattern, mothers of young offspring tended to stay home and care for them for a time and to return to work when able. A considerable number of mothers in this pattern remained outside the labor force for longer periods, some through most of their children’s school-age years. The committed nuclear family became one in which both partners tended to work full time, whether or not they had children. A variation of the committed nuclear family during the global era was the gamer family. Amid strong instrumentalism and high rationality, the tone of spousal interaction in such families was often more that of a fast-moving executive committee than of traditional community. Both spouses having had formative experience in extremely competitive employment, a high degree of calculation and negotiation often also came into these relationships. Yet the great majority of the era’s gamer marriages were not only stable but productive and caring relationships in which highly developed human beings helped bring out the best in each other while sharing life’s ambitions, joys, and sorrows. When they had children, to the extent to which these alarmingly busy parents were able to spend time with them, they tended to hover over them, ambitiously guiding and instructing them in mature ways while nervously leading them through carefully arranged developmental experiences. Having abundant resources, nannies, tutors, caterers, gardeners, and other paid service providers gave such families major assistance. Unfortunately, the gamers often postponed childbearing in the interests of career advancement for so long that only a brief window of fertility remained, as a consequence of which, along with their intense consumerism, these talented, accomplished young people tended to have", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634243384_cleaned.txt:131:5ed3235dac6f", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 1321, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634243384_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634243384", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634243384_cleaned", "chunk_index": 132, "text": "tended to hover over them, ambitiously guiding and instructing them in mature ways while nervously leading them through carefully arranged developmental experiences.

Unfortunately, the gamers often postponed childbearing in the interests of career advancement for so long that only a brief window of fertility remained, as a consequence of which, along with their intense consumerism, these talented, accomplished young people tended to have low fertility rates. Another overlapping version of the global era’s committed nuclear family was the blended family in which each partner brought children from previous marriages or relationships into the new union. These compound families could present dynamic mixes that offered rich opportunities to everyone, but they could also be undermined by tensions with former spouses or frictions with stepchildren. Another overlapping variant was the rise of the non-traditional family of committed gay or lesbian partners who lived and sometimes raised children together. These and other nontraditional family types could be loving, fruitful, and challenging. For increasingly many in global-liberal societies and especially in the United States, a second basic family pattern arose in which relationships were uncommitted, haphazard temporary pairings. Where children were present in them, the pattern comprised female-headed families. This alternative family type was typically characterized by overworked, fully employed mothers who partly ceded child raising to daycare and public schools and partly left it to chance. These parents could give considerably less time and care to their children than parents in committed nuclear families. The distribution of the uncommitted family pattern had a strong inverse correlation with education, overwhelmingly found in the United States among those without college degrees and especially among those with no more than highschool education. As the nontraditional family was on the rise, so was the “nonfamily” of unrelated adults living together. As the square footage of homes went up, they all too often became empty and barren. The family was so disrupted and weakened in the United States that child-raising suffered dramatically. With less time, energy, care, and supervision devoted to them, most children were less well socialized. The socialization of self-control particularly suffered. Many studies show the presence of the father in the family to be especially vital to the socialization of boys.246 Boys acutely need male role models and the weight of two-parent authority in the family. So much undercutting of the American nuclear family took place during the global era that the nuclear family could be said to have been slowly disintegrating as the extended family disintegrated during the early- and into the national-liberal era.

From Dating to Hooking-up. Relations changed between unmarried men and women every bit as much as they did in the family. The dominant pattern in the United States during the national era had been one in which dating led to courtship and relatively early marriage and childbearing. The global-era pattern during college years became one in which pools of young men and women socializing together while forming sexual unions predominantly within the group, sometimes leading to long-term relationships and marriage but far more often not. Within these groups, young people were often direct and nonchalant about arranging no-strings sexual encounters referred to as “hooking-up.” These liaisons reflected no commitment between partners.247 Addressing the matter of caring for the other in sexual relationships, Natalie Krinsky asked in her autobiographical novel Chloe Does Yale, “When was the last time you hooked up with someone who respected you, much less loved you? High school?”248 In Kathleen Bogle’s research, young women in particular, who usually preferred relationships with substance and commitment, were often distressed at the pattern. Some on campuses dated, but they were outside the mainstream.249 After college graduation the dominant pattern shifted to dating, although hooking-up in fleeting encounters continued for some.250 The prevalent pattern of interaction between unmarried men and women with no more than high-school education was also hanging out and hooking-up. These encounters sometimes led to continuing relationships and marriages, but progressively fewer of the relationships or the marriages were committed and stable. Relationships among the unmarried with less than college graduation became more like the pattern of underclass meaninglessness that comes up below. Hooking-up and adult-singles scenes at both ends of the social scale were among other things manifestations of impoverished community. The extent of premarital sex on U.S. campuses or elsewhere was not what struck one but rather its casualness and how soaked it often needed to be in alcohol. Hooking-up was not a prescription for stability of subsequent family life. The Gamers Apart. American society became sharply more segregated by class and especially educational class during the global era. Even as racial and ethnic segregation declined, the segregation of college graduates from non-graduates nearly doubled.251 Robert Reich referred to the phenomenon as “the secession of the successful.”252 Led by the gamers, the well-educated and affluent were pulling away from the middle class to live among like-minded others in cities like New York, Washington, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Houston, Austin, Seattle, and Raleigh-Durham. They were segregating themselves into regional, metropolitan, and neighborhood lifestyle enclaves, clustering “in communities of sameness, among people with similar ways of life, beliefs, and in the end, politics.”253 Any middle-class visitor to Manhattan, Georgetown, Bethesda, Palo", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634243384_cleaned.txt:133:ce7ddc7ed9a5", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 1323, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634243384_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634243384", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634243384_cleaned", "chunk_index": 134, "text": "the phenomenon as “the secession of the successful.”252 Led by the gamers, the well-educated and affluent were pulling away from the middle class to live among like-minded others in cities like New York, Washington, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Houston, Austin, Seattle, and Raleigh-Durham. They were segregating themselves into regional, metropolitan, and neighborhood lifestyle enclaves, clustering “in communities of sameness, among people with similar ways of life, beliefs, and in the end, politics.”253 Any middle-class visitor to Manhattan, Georgetown, Bethesda, Palo Alto, or Beverly Hills who was able to put aside the obvious signs of wealth would know immediately that he or she was separated from much that they saw by a sociocultural chasm. This phenomenon paralleled the retreat to like-minded others that had occurred in the social media. In separating geographically, the gamers and to a degree the upper-middle class became increasingly isolated from and began knowing less about their fellow citizens.254 As people became estranged from each other, their communities balkanized, and vice-versa.255 The Underclass Apart. Another social class also began sharply differentiating and separating itself from the middle class from the mid-1960s – the underclass. The underclass is comprised of those without discipline and order who overwhelmingly made up the bottom of the U.S. population by income, occupation, and education. Banfield describes the members of the underclass as “radically improvident.”256 They have short-term time horizons, and their work habits are sketchy. At the other end of the spectrum from savvy gamers, those in the underclass stumble from crisis to crisis with nothing more than the schemes or whims of the moment to guide them. Finances, housekeeping, and nutrition are chaotic in the underclass while substance abuse is rampant, and neglect and mistreatment of children are widespread. Only the most haphazard discipline exists around underclass children, who may or may not attend school and may or may not return home at a reasonable hour. Friendship is shallow and fleeting in the underclass – indeed the haphazard, episodic relationship might better be termed companionship. 257 “The only cement for personal relationships” in the underclass “is the need and desire of the moment, and nothing is stronger but more fickle than need and desire unshackled by obligation.”258 As Murray puts it, “Underclass is not a synonym for poor or even for disadvantaged…. [It is] millions of people cut off from mainstream American life. They are not cut off from its trappings (television and consumer goods penetrate everywhere) but are living a life in which the elemental building blocks – productive work, family, community – exist in fragmented and corrupted forms.”259 Adults who fail to acquire self-consciousness and self-control dwell predominantly in their short-term interests or desires, which is to say, these least-developed character types in global-liberal societies became members of the underclass.260 The ego-dominant wing of the underclass are incessant, amoral hustlers on behalf of their interests, as continually conceived and", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634243384_cleaned.txt:134:9dc83b1ec4e7", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 1324, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634243384_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634243384", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634243384_cleaned", "chunk_index": 135, "text": "(television and consumer goods penetrate everywhere) but are living a life in which the elemental building blocks – productive work, family, community – exist in fragmented and corrupted forms.”259 Adults who fail to acquire self-consciousness and self-control dwell predominantly in their short-term interests or desires, which is to say, these least-developed character types in global-liberal societies became members of the underclass.260 The ego-dominant wing of the underclass are incessant, amoral hustlers on behalf of their interests, as continually conceived and reconceived ad hoc. Without presence of the superego, the autonomous ego has a free reign of grabbing and cheating. Where the ego dominant hustle incessantly, the id dominant are more subject to the emotions and desires of the moment. Where the ego dominant tend to be streetwise and manipulative, the id dominant tend to be feckless and lazy. The former are drawn toward a life of crime, while the latter are drawn more to a life of dependency on one form or another of welfare. Increasingly many men (but not as many women) were turning to casual employment, indolence, and lives of irresponsibility in place of sustained work and family life during the era, their egos or ids respectively Even as a great deal of economic progress was being achieved in the United States, the underclass tripled in size to approximately 10 percent of the population between 1960 and 2016,261 while the two deciles above it, those in the working class, were increasingly touched by it as were those in the marginal middle class. The United States had the largest underclass of any first-world country during the global era. Its expanding underclass drew disproportionately from black, Hispanic, and Native Americans, though increasingly from white Anglos as well. Black men began withdrawing from the labor market already in 1965, a time of booming economic expansion and abundant opportunity.262 The underclass was about 70 percent minority during the mid-1980s, another booming time in which minorities made up only about 17 percent of the population.2 63 Notably, the underclass in the United Kingdom was predominantly white. Sam Shepard’s plays depict the underclass and near-underclass among inept, unreliable, and miserable white Americans, while Dalrymple’s books examine their British counterparts – broken people carrying enormous loads of confusion and disturbance.264 Such films as Streetwise, Bombay Beach, and Christiane F. poignantly depicted the lives of adults, youths, and children trapped in such patterns in the United States and abroad.265 Unwilling to get along in the economy or in orderly social life, the members of the underclass tend to be as battered and wretched as they are disruptive for others. None of the main groups at the bottom of society had been as separated from the middle class during the national era as the underclass became during the global era. The urban, lower-lower class, the national-era precursor of the underclass, was small, and its difference was less", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634243384_cleaned.txt:135:afbdeebe92fb", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 1325, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634243384_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634243384", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634243384_cleaned", "chunk_index": 136, "text": "States and abroad.265 Unwilling to get along in the economy or in orderly social life, the members of the underclass tend to be as battered and wretched as they are disruptive for others. None of the main groups at the bottom of society had been as separated from the middle class during the national era as the underclass became during the global era. The urban, lower-lower class, the national-era precursor of the underclass, was small, and its difference was less pronounced, its fecklessness less thoroughgoing, its segregation less complete, and its alienation less extreme than became the case with the underclass from the mid-1960s. Some northern black ghettos were beginning to approach full, large-scale underclass disorganization between 1945 and 1960,266 but they were not there yet. More of the bottom decile during the national era had been composed of the good but naïve and helpless traditional poor, over-represented in such places as the Mississippi Delta and Appalachia, who struggled to comprehend and cope in a modern world that was impinging upon them. More of it had also been occupied by earnest unskilled workers who tried hard to get by under difficult circumstances. By contrast, those of the global-era underclass lost their caring and fell outside the bounds of morality. If the underclass is essentially made up of those who lack a superego, the working class is made up of those whose superego is weak and have mixed success in restraining the ego and id. The working class became an unstable battleground terrain with some presence of a superego but not enough to consistently apply discipline. The middle class made up the fourth through the eighth deciles from the bottom, between the broad upper-middle and the working class. Those in the working class were often either high-school dropouts or graduates, while those in the underclass were typically dropouts. Like the former peasants of the early-liberal era, the workers of the global era tended to divide into those able and those unable to get a grip, and the latter were slipping toward the underclass. On the other hand, many who labored with their hands, who by traditional rather than character-based criteria would have been considered working class, were becoming disciplined and orderly and are better viewed as middle class. In order to grasp the coming apart that occurred in the United States during the global era, it is necessary to look at the full range of major class divergences and convergences taking place. First, as the gamers arose, they displaced the small, exclusive upper class of the national era. Second, the underclass began absorbing the relatively constrained urban lower-lower class, unskilled working-class poor, and naïve rural poor of the national era. In becoming underclass, those at the bottom escaped from middle-class constraint and influence.

This transformation brought an immense reduction in societal integration and major decline in societal performance. The nature and implications of these class changes emerge more fully later in this chapter and in the following one. Community in Europe and Japan. Informal social life remained relatively strong in large parts of Europe between 1965 and 2016, although it receded overall there too. Europeans were more alert to the value of community than Americans and less willing to relinquish it for careerism and consumerism. Club membership remained comparatively vibrant in the United Kingdom. All over Europe, cafes, pubs, trattorias, espresso bars, and public parks drew large numbers of people out to socialize. Especially on weekend evenings in many Italian cities people of all ages dressed up to promenade for hours near and around piazzas and other central locations, greeting each other, chatting, and milling about with friends and acquaintances. Most Europeans were glad to participate in the multi-leveled communities around them, although many Muslims dissented from those communities and turned exclusively to their own. The flowers ubiquitous in Europe (as in Canada) exuded a spirit of communal celebration. Less developed traditional forms of community little known today in the United States such as clientelism also survived, albeit in decline, in Italy’s Mezzogiorno, Spain’s Andalusia, and other Mediterranean regions. Yet Europe’s generally persisting strength of community was not reflected in greater strength of traditional family than in the United States. Marriage rates fell markedly in Europe, from 8 per thousand in 1970 to 4.5 per thousand in 2010 as opposed to 6.8 per thousand in the United States in 2009. During the same 40-year period, divorce rates doubled from 1 to 2 per thousand in Europe while they reached 3.4 per thousand in the United States. During the twenty years from 1990 to 2010, nonmarital births in Europe more than doubled from 17.4 to 37.4 percent of all births.267 Rates of divorce generally remained lower in Europe than in the United States, but rates of never marrying and of childlessness were higher across the Atlantic.

Where the United States had more whose family formation was haphazard and underclass-like, Europe had more who consciously chose to live in nontraditional arrangements. Many Europeans cohabited in stable, monogamous pairs in which a surprisingly good climate for raising children was maintained. Although nonmarital births increased sharply, many more fathers of nonmarital children in Europe remained in close contact with and supportive of their offspring than in the United States. Overall, cohabiting European parents showed distinctly greater commitment to each other and their children than did their American counterparts. On the other hand, at far below replacement, Europe’s fertility rates were the lowest in the world, along with Japan’s. This “birth dearth” introduced disequilibrium into the age structure and created massive drag on economies and societies. France, where most non-immigrant children became nonmarital, launched family legislation that included the extension of generous parental subsidies and rights that applied irrespective of marital status or citizenship. As a result, that country was able to restore fertility rates to replacement levels, if only with the help of immigrants’ heavy utilization of the policies. Viewed narrowly, immigration was a source of communal and familial strength for Europe in some respects, for immigrant community remained stronger than native community in all but a few European countries. But, viewed broadly, it introduced a destructive communal clash between Westerners and Muslims. Neither continuing sources of communal strength nor influxes of it offset the overall weakening of European community. The dominant pattern of premarital relations in Europe over the global era was starkly different from that in the United States. European young people tended to have series of more exclusive relationships. The early ones usually did not lead to long-term partnership or marriage, but they tended to be relatively caring and meaningful, and they entailed a certain commitment. Europe, in keeping with its more intact community overall, encountered relatively little of the American commodification of sex followed by hardly wanting to say hello the next day, or of the general edge of shallow and raw unfeeling about which many of the young and not so young in the United States were unhappy.

Japan’s community remained much stronger than that of the West, even though it too was both receding and changing in form, especially in the younger generations. Nevertheless, rates of divorce more than doubled in Japan.268 That country retained a prominent shame mechanism that upheld standards of conduct rooted in strong community, although with each postwar generation it too was receding. Hyper-concern with people’s regard for others, known as face, correspondingly decreased in importance. Japan’s longstanding protection of rice farmers from competition was one example of its extensive preservation of traditional community. Community in the Liberalizing Third World. Liberalizing third-world countries also increasingly developed social marketplaces, and wholesale disruption of the village, tribe, clan, and extended family was taking place. The movement from subsistence communal farming and crafts to a money economy had long been complete in the most developed countries, but it continued in the third world. Many third-world cooperatives formed during the national era, such as Mexico’s ejidos (with communal/cooperative ownership of land), were driven under or sold off and transformed into profit-making enterprises. As the subsistence economy was receding, and the vibrant community of traditional life was collapsing, former peasants were migrating in vast numbers from villages into cities all over the third world. The uprooting of traditional community left people in more exposed circumstances although the nuclear family generally remained at least moderately strong in the third world, aside from some cities. Caste, the distinctive overarching structure of India’s communal relations, remained strong there, if less so in the South, but it was weakening as a prescribed source of occupation.269 Intermarriage between castes was also increasing, especially in the cities. Yet 74 percent of Indians still expressed disapproval of inter-caste marriages in 2006 and 72 percent supported allowing parents the final say in their children’s marriage partners, although with marked urban-rural differences.270 Voting with one’s caste was pronounced in India. “Sanscritization,” in which the lower castes imitated the lifestyles and ritual requirements of the higher castes, was also occurring even as the higher castes sometimes moved on to less traditional concerns.

It also did so despite the booming economy that drew vast numbers into protracted hours of employment or into migration within the country for jobs, and despite the politically sponsored construction projects that dislocated families, neighborhoods, and sometimes towns or cities without regard to people’s livelihoods, often without recompense. Family ties remained particularly strong in China even though the one-child policy, in effect from 1980 until partly rescinded under Xi Jinping in 2013, was traumatic for them. The social markets were stifled in most Muslim countries during the global era in favor of coercively protecting and supporting robust traditional community. Their hierarchical regimes imposed isolation from the rest of the world and directed severe legal discrimination against those who were different. The traditional suppression and sequestration of women were perceived as integral to the continuing strength of community under the Islamic Resurgence. The widespread support for suicidal murder to advance the faith in the Islamic world was a telltale indicator, reminiscent of imperial Japan, of intense strength of community and weakness of social markets. How Did Diversity Undermine Community? The United States and oth-er liberal societies developed social marketplaces in part because, technologies of transportation and communication, the scope of the world to which people gained regular access became vast and varied. New technologies enabled diverse people and communities to come into close contact. Bitter experience at home and abroad of the dangers of coercive hierarchy also led people to support the social markets and encourage those of different races, ethnicities, and lifestyles to live and work side by side. Yet, in keeping with the creation and destruction that all kinds of markets entail, if much was gained, much was also lost in accommodating this enormous human variation. More than a century ago, Simmel wrote perceptively about the ways in which life changes as large numbers of people of varied cultures and lifestyles are brought together in urbanization: They become blasé, reserved cosmopolites, somewhat alienated from others and indifferent to the stimulation, while tending to feel lost and lonely.271 Urban agglomerations continued to grow, multiplying these effects even as their diversity was increasingly joined by that of virtual cities as well, for the electronic media and especially the web greatly intensified the chaotic-exotic effect of urbanism. The global era’s remarkable encounter with social markets, difference, and diversity brought astonishing freedom and tolerance; but also left many estranged from others in their countries, cities, neighborhoods, and even families.

When people agree about a great deal, it is easy for them to identify and feel a sense of community with each other; when they agree about little, affiliation becomes difficult. Community was severely disrupted around great sociocultural markets where vast diversity arose in huge cauldrons of mixing. Often no longer able to feel understood by and comfortable with many who were around them, people pulled back in their attachments, weakening community. As Émile Durkheim compellingly establishes, deep differences within communities and families tend to afflict people with profound feelings of separateness and loneliness.272 An aching sense of social isolation accompanied global-liberal societies’ extensive unbridged differences. Community was also devastated by the shattered moral consensus that left it unprotected. The many who were well disposed could no longer count on civility in public spaces, or even sometimes their safety, from those ill-disposed. Diminished informal social control in the name of tolerance explained a good deal of why people often became jumpy and kept more to themselves and others like them when in public. Most of those changes were generational, associated with people who came of age after 1965, as they succeeded earlier generations.273 The bohemian moral uprising under way during the 1950s was closely associated with rebellion against and withdrawal from traditions of broad communal participation. The beatniks withdrew from the mundane public sphere, hanging wry or long faces amid the good cheer of the time. The 1960s generation greatly expanded that withdrawal. Estranged socially and morally from the middle class, lifestyle revolutionaries wanted little to do with the larger community whose ways and values they regarded with contempt. As is more fully explored in the next chapter, many moral standards that once reinforced community and the family no longer did. They more often met for power lunches, less often for simpatico. Because economic markets so strained the genuine, a degree of hardness came to characterize many on the job, in the labor markets, and in their personal lives, that would have shocked and saddened their mid-century predecessors. The hyper-rationality of the gamers threw off community much more than had the modest rationality of the shopkeepers, independent craftsmen, and small farmers of the early-liberal period, or that of the protected white-collar employees of the national-liberal period. Weber and Theodor Adorno’s references to the nullity of emotion engendered by modern business were far more apt during the global era than they were during the national.274 Gary Becker’s economistic assumptions about rational calculation in human action were not only no longer extreme but often patently germane.275 Camaraderie, friendship, family, and", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634243384_cleaned.txt:141:f77d38303696", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 1331, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634243384_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634243384", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634243384_cleaned", "chunk_index": 142, "text": "than had the modest rationality of the shopkeepers, independent craftsmen, and small farmers of the early-liberal period, or that of the protected white-collar employees of the national-liberal period.

In addition to picking up instrumentalism at work, people absorbed it via shopping and advertising. Imperious capitalist marketing’s capture of wants dramatically intensified economic motivation. Ever-present, glamor-soaked media images of a life made more desirable by appealing goods and services became irresistible, drawing people away from almost everything else to dedicate their lives alternately to working and shopping. The experience of having been chronically misled and gypped by cynical marketing ploys hardened consumers and made them tough minded and critical. Lifetime recipients of every high-handed merchandising, advertising, and financial manipulation frequently ceased treating each other with gentleness and trust. Such harshness in everyday life further undercut community. Increased individualism and decreased collectivism also weakened community, for individualism is complementary to and supportive of markets as collectivism is to hierarchy. Where protected national capitalism fostered the moderate collectivism and regard for the commonweal of the national era, wide-open global capitalism produced much of the global era’s greater individualism. Immersion in non-economic markets and isolating media also promoted individualism. As global-capitalist economic growth occurred, society was unable to keep up with the changes; and damaging social lag occurred in this country and the world. Where the economic markets had had their longest and most rapid runs, the communal disruption was most acute. That contemporary conditions were so difficult for community, often leaving it with insufficient resources to initiate or maintain itself, was why the task of sponsoring community, whether face-to-face or mediated, increasingly fell upon economic entities fostering it for their own purposes. Thus, the dating services, newcomers’ organizations, and planned company social activities that were proliferating. Confined as it was in time, setting, and aspect of life, no wonder friendship often became shallower and shorter lived. Why Did Mediated Sociality Become So Prevalent? Mediated community became so extensive primarily because capitalist technological advance brought unforeseen possibilities. Potential demand for the new forms of community had long been there, and as supply caught up with some of that demand, consumers leapt to make use of it. People could still be sociable in overwhelmingly unmediated ways during the national era because technologies were not yet sufficiently developed to easily and inexpensively allow them to travel or communicate when apart.276 The question of why mediated community increased largely reduces to an economic one that has already been answered, namely why the new technologies", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634243384_cleaned.txt:142:b16d782c09f1", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 1332, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634243384_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634243384", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634243384_cleaned", "chunk_index": 143, "text": "new forms of community had long been there, and as supply caught up with some of that demand, consumers leapt to make use of it.

As people interact more through electronic devices and less through face-to-face engagement, their abilities, skill sets, and ways of perceiving, thinking, feeling, and acting also change. Why Was the Family Devastated? Diversity strained the family as it strained community generally. Broad social peace is more easily achieved in liberal societies amid diversity than are the happy relationships between spouses or among other family members that constitute foundations of thriving community. Maintaining marriages became more difficult in part because starkly different character profiles, yet negligibly reconciled, were often coming together. It is challenging for combinations of gamer and middle class, democratic and authoritarian, idealist and realist, moral and amoral, and other personality types to adjust to each other in close relationships. Becoming more independent also led women to strongly form their own political views, widening the gender gap and aggravating disagreement between spouses and partners, as among friends. The global era’s increasingly mixed marriages, by character, political persuasion, and ethnic and religious background made it more difficult for couples to achieve and maintain close harmony. Even where difference diminished, the conditions of global-liberal societies could throw relationships off balance. In earlier times women had tended to be more emotional and men more instrumental and rational, but after millennia of reconciliation, this opposition in gender relations had been substantially overcome in the traditional, complementary though hierarchical manner that was no longer appropriate. Their profiles may have converged in this respect as women approached men in instrumentalism due to their intensified economic experience, but adaptation to that global-era metamorphosis of character was not easy from either side. Coming to terms with a changing power balance between men and women was even more difficult. Women fought for and obtained, in many areas, equal rights and equal opportunity. They came to exceed men in educational attainment and to equal or exceed them in economic potential, self-confidence, and social power. Most men became more democratic figures at home, less authoritarian and more approachable by their partners and children, but many men were also slow to adjust to this new reality and had difficulty abandoning their traditional patriarchal status and lingering sexism. Many women were no longer willing to accept this, resulting in a good deal of relational conflict and increased divorce.

Many women were no longer willing to accept this, resulting in a good deal of relational conflict and increased divorce. Only among the well-educated was the opposition between men and women largely overcome, with men’s expectations realigned and decision-making relatively democratic within relationships. This success occurred in part because college graduates were more likely to be adept at working through conflict and in part because they were more exposed to and imbued with liberal culture and informal norms supporting gender equality. More materialistic values also played a role in weakening the family. Among other things, the entry of homemakers into the labor force, advanced everywhere in the first and second worlds during the global era and well under way in the third, was a ringing endorsement of economic goals and forsaking of communal ones. From the 1960s a woman was widely regarded as more successful in life than her mother or grandmother when she had dispensed nurturant services impersonally, for a salary, and on a large scale that her forebears had conferred voluntarily upon their family and community. She was more esteemed still if she coolly dispensed financial, legal, or consulting services. Yet moral decline contributed most to the global era’s disruption of the family. Many more people than during the preceding era simply no longer cared or only minimally cared about others. Among those who still cared, many adopted relatively untested and often hazardous new “moralities” that invite further damage to community, often with good intentions. When established morality was no longer accepted or was only accepted selectively or when convenient, it became difficult to count on others, with the result that community suffered, and especially the family. In an increasingly amoral society, people became bruisers and the bruised, making them less likely to give of themselves or to trust. Having been taken advantage of by the carnivores, even those with good hearts became tougher and more self-protective. An appalling but revealing joke I overheard one Hollywood screenwriter telling another in Los Angeles in 1994 went, “Do you know how they say ‘F— you!’ in LA? … ‘Trust me!’” The familism paradigm prevalent in the United States during the national-liberal era dissolved through the 1960s, 1970s, and the following decades, greatly stressing families and marriages in all communities. The nuclear family of the 1950s had strong moral support, and considerable resources and time were channeled into it – “togetherness” was all the rage. The youth culture that was already beginning during the late 1940s and 1950s and came into its own during the late 1960s greatly undermined traditional family norms.277 Self-indulgence or “expressive individualism,” as many term it, reacted", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634243384_cleaned.txt:144:eae828c24e11", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 1334, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634243384_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634243384", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634243384_cleaned", "chunk_index": 145, "text": "national-liberal era dissolved through the 1960s, 1970s, and the following decades, greatly stressing families and marriages in all communities.

Efforts to support the nuclear family under the social conservative banner of “family values” were ambivalent, retro, contested, and little able to replace the departed familism – retro because stylized, defensive, nostalgic attempts to wish thriving traditional families back into existence without the secure, centered middle class or intact, supportive consensus that were the keys to the national-era social nexus. The moral slippage that began steeply accelerating during the late 1960s as rebellion set in against traditional normative authority, centrally concerned sexual activity. As David Popenoe puts it, “left culturally unregulated, men’s sexual behavior can be promiscuous, their paternity casual, their commitment to families weak.”278 Men’s vulnerability to disruptive sexual yearnings and their insensitivity to the needs of society and community in the absence of effective consensus led them to seek more sexual partners, postpone and avoid marriage, divorce more frequently, have fewer children, and neglect the ones they had. A consensus no longer supported the family by socializing and enforcing strong personal morals in young people or by buttressing male allegiance to the family. Without such outside moral support, frictions and trials between spouses became much more difficult to surmount. The irresponsibility released by disordered morés brought a series of reverberating effects that importantly included women’s reactions to the new conditions. As men and women pursued their desires with diminished accountability, women frequently fell victim to circumstances and bore the brunt of the direct, painful consequences of unwanted pregnancies, abortion, and single parenthood. Moral decline and especially the growing unreliability of men fundamentally altered the situation of women and prompted much, though not all, of their exodus from full-time homemaking into the world of work.279 Global-era American feminism grew out of these experiences. Many of the changes that led to the empowerment of women from the mid-1960s were consequences of hard knocks received in the economic and social markets. Single and divorced mothers frequently had no recourse but to enter the labor market off balance while raising children alone. In order to hedge against this vulnerability, young women and their parents quickly realized that they had to be as prepared as men for the labor force. What followed was also realization that along with independence a career could bring unexpected satisfaction. Women, like men, were now prepared to go it alone if necessary.

The wholesale abandonment of homemaking as a career was for the most part forced upon women by the actions of men. Overemphasizing other, secondary sources of this change put a happy face on what was a moral fait accompli. Moral disorder had consequences for the socialization of children as well. Amid moral discreditation, divorced and single parents were often less able to maintain authority over their children or to use well the attention and resources they had. Mothers might fill in for missing fathers in many ways, but they tended to have particular difficulty doing so when it came to disciplining teenagers and especially teenage sons in circumstances of moral complexity. Divorced parents often spent too little time with their children and then felt guilty about the fact and overcompensated by spoiling them, further undermining their self-control. Being fearful of losing contact with their children also often put such parents in an ambiguous position. Widowed mothers or fathers, who gain sympathy rather than bear taint, present the one category of single parents that had no exceptional moral difficulty raising children successfully (although they certainly endured human difficulty). Steady, engaged, thoughtful, loving, uncompromised socialization of children became less common. Sociocultural reproduction occurred, but it was too often carried out, not by parents or dedicated surrogates, but by peer groups and the media, which is to say, by sociocultural markets – and in these, children on their own had disappointing outcomes. Global-era American society in many ways became deeply inhospitable and troubling to children. But the global era’s irresponsibility, which was not the exclusive property of any gender or lifestyle, also manifested itself in other ways than sexual impropriety that undermined the family; including refusal to limit spending, inability to avoid substance abuse, failure to do household chores, unwillingness to restrain inconsiderateness, or stubborn insistence on narrow leanings that could only bring anguish to the other. Spouses no longer felt as committed as they once had to the partners who had given them trust and the children who had been placed in their care. Of greater concern to many spouses than their obligations to the family was the thrill of another sexual encounter or escape from a relationship burdened by difference. Americans’ high-marriage, high-divorce pattern is partly explained by Andrew Cherlin as arising from a combination of their culture’s extolling of both marriage and strong individualism,280 but this explanation needs further development.

For the high-marriage, high-divorce pattern is primarily middle rather than upper-middle class. Despite their high divorce rates, middle-class Americans keep marrying at a high rate in part because theirs is a bourgeois outlook entailing comparatively intact religiosity and traditionalism. Amid the tattered community around them, middle-class Americans, deprived of sociality and buffeted on many sides, turned more quickly and sometimes desperately to marriage, in part for company and in part as an island of stability. Yet because the many-sided markets were strong in the United States, Americans were more individualist and less protected by consensus, and therefore divorced frequently. In their individualism they were private, kept their own counsel, and tended not to deeply interchange with others. This marital pattern evokes the “gladhanding” that David Riesman lampooned in The Lonely Crowd in 1950.281 The high-marriage, high-divorce profile goes with the bourgeois superficiality that, then as later, manifested itself in relatively shallow friendship. In their market-forged optimism, global-era Americans were venturesome in relationships as they were in business. What Played Havoc with Meaningful Nonmarital Relationships? The hooking-up pattern between young men and women on college campuses and beyond was largely a joint function of three conditions: First, when society and character become extremely instrumental and rational, informal sociality tends to mean less to people – thus the cold manipulation of this thin form of communal interaction. Second, hooking up was a function of the enormous social power conferred on young men by unbalanced sex ratios, which reached 3:2 overall, women to men, among undergraduates. These circumstances placed young men in a monopolistic position – women could deal with them or do without male companionship. The asymmetry of male-female relations was intensified by the fact that men’s biological clocks were ticking at a slower pace than women’s; they thought of marrying and having children several years later than women.282 In the resulting “battle of the sexes,” young men and women tugged and negotiated in the social and moral markets over whose needs were to be met and whose not.283 A good deal of this shortage of men came from greater male dysfunctionality. Third, hooking up also arose from the fact that some of the more immediate and dire negative consequences of combining promiscuity and excessive alcohol intake were reduced in the socially selective and safer, summer-camp-like settings of residential college campuses. Thus also, part of the reversion to dating prevalent after college.

Thus also, part of the reversion to dating prevalent after college. That marriage occurred later in life explained much about why there would be more premarital sex than in the previous era but little about why hooking up became the dominant form of sexual encounter between young people. Many serious, young college graduates wanted to find worthy spouses and therefore moved into dating relationships for that reason as well. The greater mixing of ages in the work world conferred some initial respite for women from the college sex-ratio imbalance, giving them access to older and more mature men. Yet male dysfunctionality in time also created sex-ratio imbalance in the post-college population. Much of boys’ educational lagging went back to the more damaging effects of family instability on the rearing of boys than of girls, since that instability mainly took the form of absent fathers. The effects were cumulative generationally and led to further deficits of responsible parenting and supervision, especially on the part of men. The proportionately greater slippage of men in the non-college-graduate adult population had even stronger effects in the same direction. A major source of this sex imbalance was also that boys were being chewed up and needlessly discouraged in a female-centered educational system more out of sync with boys’ than with girls’ Piagetian timetables. Primary-grade pacing and curricula were weighted toward the needs of girls by educational institutions overwhelmingly dominated by women. Boys have plenty of natural ability, but most boys mature more slowly. The Finns prioritize social-emotional adjustment, respect boys’ timetables, extend low-key preschool play years, and then seriously accelerate performance expectations later. In no small part as a result, they had among the best educational outcomes in the world. Boys aged 5, 6, and 7 needed to be running in schoolyards and playing much more than they were, and not shackled to inappropriate academic expectations and left needlessly discouraged when young.284 Everyone would be better engaged and society’s interests better served by more balanced pacing and curricula, boys especially.285 However well intentioned, the incessant, nervous pushing of young children by gamers of both genders aggravated this condition. Alienating boys from education harmed their development and weakened their economic and sociocultural resources as adults – no conspiracy here, just the usual, banal obliviousness to the other. It is seldom noted that the bulk of the sex-ratio imbalance in college attendance by gender came not from the upper-middle and middle classes but from the working class, or that disproportionately much of this imbalance came from minority males.286 Working-class", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634243384_cleaned.txt:148:ed94b2de9473", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 1338, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634243384_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634243384", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634243384_cleaned", "chunk_index": 149, "text": "of young children by gamers of both genders aggravated this condition.

Multiculturalist blame worsened the disadvantage by wreaking havoc upon working-class minority machismo. Such undesirable economic, social, and moral consequences as men’s diminished labor-force participation, family formation, college attendance, and suitability as partners for accomplished young women flowed from educational discouragement early in life. Why Did the Gamers Pull Away? The gamers and to a degree the upper-middle class pulled away from the middle class partly in order to celebrate life with similar others and avoid the abrasion and alienation of unresolved difference. The classes were not yet so different in character and lifestyle during the 1950s and early 1960s. Once respect for and consideration of the middle class dissolved amid broken consensus and difference too great for easy, comfortable interaction, the gamers began withdrawing into narrow lifestyle communities, migrating to regions, cities, and neighborhoods with concentrations of like-minded others in order that they could more easily and happily form communal relations and find economic and cultural opportunities. Bringing their increasingly distinct worlds with them, the gamers pulled away in search of their own unity and coherence, even while loudly extolling difference. Local homogeneity gave them more fertile ground for developing communal relations and shared culture. First, a sufficient number of people have to possess a distinctive set of tastes and preferences. Second, they have to be able to get together and form a critical mass large enough to shape the local scene … in 1963 there was still no critical mass of the people who would later be called symbolic analysts, the educated class, the creative class, or the cognitive elite.”287 The sociocultural division of the late 1960s prepared the way for the separation of the gamers, as is more fully explained in the next chapter. Ten to fifteen years later, global capitalism began coming into its own, producing the character in numbers sufficiently large to break away. The critical mass of gamers jelled during the 1980s.288 Why the large, national-era middle class came apart into these two classes is ultimately because society went through another epochal development as radical as that presented by the unfolding of the superego during the late Middle Ages and its consolidation during the Reformation.

In the 13^(th) , 14^(th) , and 15^(th) centuries, those with middle-class discipline found it increasingly difficult to accept the institutional arrangements of posturing aristocrats and simple, id-dominant peasants. The middle class had much higher expectations than either of those classes regarding an orderly life, and its members did not feel comfortable with the leanings of those classes. Nor did members of the other classes feel comfortable with the leanings of the bourgeois. Nearly a hundred years of religious wars came out of that profound difference before an exhausted Europe began to settle into partial coexistence after 1648. Wrenching conflict between the classes and the character types and structures associated with them, although diminishing, continued in various forms through the defeat of the Axis powers in World War II. The global-era tension between the gamers and the middle class rested upon similarly profound differences of experience and character. The gamers’ perception of their fundamental difference was neither gratuitous nor spurious. Their distinct character and the conditions out of which it arose were the foundation of this new class divergence. In liberal societies, people who are as fundamentally different from each other as the gamers and the middle class do not easily get along in marriages, friendships, or neighborhoods. A bumper sticker I saw on numerous cars in Berkeley leading up to the 2008 presidential election read, “Friends Don’t Have Friends Who Are Republican.” America’s upper class of gamers was having increasing difficulty recognizing or acknowledging the humanity of the middle class. Education was increasingly important to how people fared in the social markets primarily because education is largely about learning how to negotiate one’s way through the sociocultural markets. It consists of absorbing facts, interpretations, theories, philosophies, aesthetics, and skills regarding the sociocultural and natural worlds, of learning to be critical and creative in coping with them. Society was no longer coherent in any simple, straightforward manner. If people were to discern even moderate coherence in it and become able to move through it fluently, they had to possess considerable critical facility and knowledge. If they did not, they had little hope other than blind faith in a worthy religion, and even then, there were confusing currents to sort out and choices to be made.

Jews, owing in part to their exceptionally cosmopolitan experience, were particularly well equipped to deal with difference. By contrast, communities that were sheltered from difference were particularly vulnerable to disruption. Those of provincial backgrounds often took serious drubbings in the sociocultural markets when they slipped away from their moorings. How Did the Underclass Get Away? Much of the global-era expansion of the underclass and its growing separation from the rest of society arose as a consequence of the sociocultural markets. As these markets intensified and spread, traditional peasants’ idyllic worlds and groupbound moralities collapsed in all but the most backward corners of the world, for the id dominant are utterly needful of tight traditional community and the accompanying sense of shame to enforce social order and moral ways. Peasants and their offspring had been protected for millennia in traditional hierarchical societies and still to some degree in middle-class ones, but refuge for them vanished all over the world under the gamers. Workers were affected similarly. As the sociocultural markets strengthened, the vibrant nuclear and extended families, neighborhoods, church communities, and substantially groupbound moralities also largely collapsed. Those institutions, often ethnic, had played an important role in stabilizing them through the national era. Without reliable self-control, workers had tended toward some disorderliness in earlier American history, but solid community supplemented by social support and pressures, had generally kept them and their families intact and their children adequately socialized.289 Disproportionately much of the underclass phenomenon was associated with minorities possessing limited sociocultural resources such as education and family networks. First- and third-world underclasses included many migrants and their offspring from traditional societies or corners of society who were unable to consolidate rational self-control in the sociocultural markets, and whose lives were upended into chaos. In the United States, blacks from the rural South, Mexicans from the central highlands, and whites from the Appalachians and Ozarks were exposed to the stresses of cosmopolitan diversity in comparable ways. In his memoir Black Boy, Richard Wright referred to his father as a peasant who had not made it in the city.290 Such migrants either achieved self-control, or they slipped into the underclass. The underclass phenomenon frequently came not from the first-generation migrants of modest sociocultural resources, who had been armored by self-selected venturesomeness and their inheritance of coherent traditional ways but, surprisingly, from their children, who were born in chaotic new settings and had neither sufficient traditional nor sufficient modern resources.

The underclass phenomenon frequently came not from the first-generation migrants of modest sociocultural resources, who had been armored by self-selected venturesomeness and their inheritance of coherent traditional ways but, surprisingly, from their children, who were born in chaotic new settings and had neither sufficient traditional nor sufficient modern resources. Although often themselves protected, the first generation of humble migrants seeking opportunity was unable to assure that its children acquired the discipline and education they needed to succeed in a wideopen society. Upper-middle- and solid middle-class migrants and their children, who possess greater sociocultural resources, had few such problems. The unusually strong community of Asian immigrants better protected its offspring than most, although the less developed Laotian Hmong among them did not fully escaped these problems in the United States. Nor were those who remained behind in rural areas any longer spared similar trials. For example, in 1965 many in northern New Mexico’s remote Rio Arriba County with its Spanish colonial roots still possessed traditional, peasant-like earnestness and simplicity; but by the end of the era comparatively few did. Much of the earlier id dominance was overcome by movement into the middle class, but much of it also turned into underclass fecklessness, indolence, scheming, and attitude. Many Native Americans and Canadian First Nation peoples were in comparable condition. Dynamic and turbulent societies like the global-era United States, Mexico, and Brazil were merciless in the sociocultural challenges they posed to the less able; whose richly textured routines, villages, neighborhoods and extended families no longer existed. The more wide-open the sociocultural markets and more extreme their ethnic and lifestyle mixing, the more these markets worked their disorder. A great deal of how the sociocultural markets contributed to an expanding underclass was through family disorganization via its impact upon morality. The hard edge of underclass disorganization was rarely found where stable two-parent families were present. Much of the national era U.S. lower-lower class was transformed into the underclass beginning in the 1960s as their families became fractured and unreliable. The middle and working classes were eroding as well. Elizabeth Marquardt et al. find that the “disappearance of marriage in Middle America [was] tracking with the disappearance of the middle class in the same communities….”291 The dramatic increase in the number of unattached, adult males out of the labor force in the United States was intimately related to the devastation of the family, both as cause and as effect. As the family disintegrated, the underclass recruited, especially among men with only high-school education or less.292 Family disorganization was extreme in the black community, but its situation was not unique.

When children are raised poorly, they have fewer resources to bring to school, employment, parenting, and families of their own, initiating a downward spiral. As in other communities, moral decline and male irresponsibility led to undependability as husbands and fathers, and a generation later to higher rates of dysfunctionality and joblessness. As enabling partners and mothers, women played large roles in these problems too. Accelerated disintegration of the black family from the 1960s was a far larger cause of comparatively low black achievement than lingering prejudice or discrimination. Where blacks form stable families, their incomes approach those of whites. The median personal incomes of blacks who were married and living together during the two decades from 1992 through 2011 were 91 percent those of whites who were married,296 not bad considering the differences in education. When family structure is controlled for, the enormous differences in crime rates between blacks and whites also disappear.297 The robust family and community of Asian Americans and to a lesser degree Hispanics brought them corresponding advantages. From the 19^(th) -century beginnings of their immigration into the United States, Asians utilized strong community as an asset with which to steer group members toward opportunities in business, employment, and education.298 Their well-earned achievement, attested to by almost 25 percent higher household incomes than non-Hispanic whites,299 was grounded in the strength and stability of family and community. The weakness and instability of family and community among black Americans, in addition to manifesting itself in family disintegration, did so in a damaging paucity of the social networks through which jobs could be obtained. The underclass was able to greatly expand and evade middle-class order in large part because of multiculturalism’s pervasive negativism that made it difficult for minorities in the United States to find their way.

When people busy themselves denying, justifying, or blaming others for their predominantly home-grown chaos, low school performance, low labor-force participation, low income, and high crime, they are not taking responsibility for and resolving to improve themselves. Squarely facing inadequacies, accepting responsibility, and resolving to do better are what everyone must do in life. Bad-faith, defensive denial of the poor performance of disproportionately many blacks with respect to family responsibility was a bedrock distortion of black culture under multiculturalism. Black Americans did better during the global era where their numbers were small, and particularly well in Wyoming where they were exceptionally small,300 because they were insulated there from the root cause of their problems, the self-fulfilling, black culture of negativism and blame. The analogous negativism that destabilized marginal whites in Britain was the anti-class rhetoric that was already building after the war and reached a crescendo during the 1960s and 1970s. A related reason for the growth of the underclass during the era was the great expansion of counterproductive welfare programs, also driven in no small part by multiculturalist blame. Life on the dole in its scores of proliferating forms encouraged dependency, fostered helplessness, and underwrote irresponsibility. The excesses of the welfare state worsened the condition of most of its putative beneficiaries and increased the scale of the underclass by removing or diminishing the lessons of the real world. In slack, chaotic settings, the size of the underclass is regulated to a considerable extent by the number of welfare slots made available. The welfare reforms of the 1990s pushed many in the underclass into the world of work, moving them toward discipline and order. President Obama’s executive abrogation of those reforms in 2012 reversed this course and accelerated downward slippage into the underclass. Meliorism without tough-minded controls and accountability is a formula for decline. The condition of the underclass is often referred to as one of poverty, but that interpretation is at once superficial and co-dependent. Essential about those in the underclass is that they lack self-control, a deficiency that bars their route to the middle class, which is one of diligent application at work and in family life. What all too often lies behind their lack of self-control is that those in the underclass have been persuaded to blame society for their troubles. That tragic negativism renders them unwilling to try to do better.

All that the vulnerable often needed to nudge them into a downward spiral around powerful and confusing sociocultural currents was exposure to spurious blame, eligibility for the dole, or access to drugs. Psychiatrist Theodore Dalrymple refers to Britain’s worst poverty, as Americans should to theirs, as “poverty of the soul.”301 The income and opportunities of those labeled poor were ample for developing themselves and building a secure future, but those were options they all too often declined. The material want of those in the underclass, such as it was, was overwhelmingly the product of their indiscipline and attitude. The problem of the underclass was within, not without. The underclass also expanded and got away because the tattered consensus since 1965 allowed it to. Increasing residential and social segregation by class and lifestyle removed role models and agents of middle-class moral enforcement from those most vulnerable. The Wilson thesis presents an instance of this: As the black middle class fled the ghettos, the more concentrated lower class left behind, without the needed models and consensus enforcers, slid downward.302 The same principle holds in other groups. Yet much of that exodus was motivated precisely by the need to escape endemic nuisances and immorality brought about by the prior removal of sociocultural and legal support for consensus. When combined with the underclass’s conflictualist rudeness and high crime, the gamers’ radical relativism and extreme civil liberties have made life around the underclass intolerable to the middle classes of all groups.303 Why Did Community Remain Stronger in Europe than in the United States? Europe was better able than the United States to preserve community in part because it curbed the economic markets to a greater degree. Largely for that reason, Europeans were more collectivist and less individualist than Americans, to the benefit of community. Among Europeans the British, Netherlanders, and Swiss were supportive of the economic markets and tended toward greater individualism. Nevertheless, the growing force of the economic markets in Europe considerably eroded community and increased individualism during the global era. European societies’ historical insularity and comparative harmonization also contributed to their retention of relatively homogeneous and strong community. Community was more off balance in this country because it had undergone great geographical mobility and the chaotic mixing of diverse peoples.

Nevertheless, the growing force of the economic markets in Europe considerably eroded community and increased individualism during the global era. European societies’ historical insularity and comparative harmonization also contributed to their retention of relatively homogeneous and strong community. Community was more off balance in this country because it had undergone great geographical mobility and the chaotic mixing of diverse peoples. Europe’s shielded exposure to capitalism was responsible for its greater stability of families and relationships in particular; its generally more extensive state intervention in support of the family, parenting, and community was part and parcel of its extensive retained economic hierarchy. These conditions, together with the decline of Christianity and mildness of middle-class repression, enabled Europeans to experiment with new communal forms without such destructive outcomes as in the United States. The European pattern of sustained relationships as opposed to the American of greater flux, stemmed from less exposure to the economic markets, more collectivist personalities, and deeper and more profound engagement with close others. European men’s and especially working-class men’s better integration into society and adjustment to family life than in the United States also arose from the region’s greater sociocultural harmony and lesser alienation and conflictualism. Long having been less religious, even as they maintained generally more intact community and consensus, Europeans were able to support less unhealthy alternative lifestyles. The small size of Europe’s underclass owed in part to its stronger community and consensus as well as to its notably restricted immigration until the late 1980s and early 1990s. Its underclass expanded after that as less developed immigrant populations grew in response to liberalized immigration laws, relatively lax welfare policies, and the onset of multiculturalism, in a context of social permissiveness. Stronger European community also posed barriers to the acceptance and integration of the newly arrived that were not as present in the United States. This country’s more disrupted community and consensus helped allow it to better take in and assimilate the large immigration it experienced. On the other hand, Europe, until recently, did a better job of integrating black immigrants because its black population was small, diverse, and included a large proportion of well-educated international students. Japan’s policy of nearly closed borders played a major role in keeping its community exceptionally strong and homogeneous. Why Was Community Strong but Vulnerable in the Liberalizing Third World? The liberal culture accompanying global capitalism had a tiered impact on the third world, much as it did in the first world, and this differential impact depended upon the cultural power of the various traditions. Societies that encountered the treacherous sociocultural markets from the 1960s with at least the resources of mature traditional hierarchical societies, including well-established high cultures and world religions, had greater potential for adapting in an orderly way than societies which did not, facilitating their retention of coherent community.

Most of Asia was on relatively firm ground while processing the sharply different Western cultures to which it was exposed,304 but societies that never reached the mature traditional hierarchical stage and thus lacked important sociocultural resources were often unable to digest and manage an orderly encounter with the sociocultural markets, or, for that matter, to effectively resist them. Unable to find their balance, they tended to lapse into chaos following sustained impact. Where many did not have the indigenous resources with which to digest what they encountered, as in sub-Saharan Africa, the sociocultural disintegration was far reaching, and underclasses formed to the extent permitted by economic slack. India’s persistent, though diminishing, strength of caste and community was in keeping with its impressive sociocultural heritage and the continuing relative strength of community in the third world. For strength of community is inversely proportional to the intensity of the economic and sociocultural markets and the duration they have been encountered. That is part of why caste is weaker in urban than rural areas. Caste underwent more erosion in the more developed South because India’s openness to the economic markets, though late, was more advanced in that region. Even mature traditional hierarchical societies with world religions were unbalanced by, and fairly helpless against Western society and culture until the global era. Only when their will and discipline were newly fortified by exposure to the global markets, were most from the stronger traditions able to adapt socio-culturally. Where the economic and sociocultural markets had been seriously curtailed or had only recently begun to open up, more respite existed for coherent community and the less developed people who depended upon it. Why the Strong Communal Patterns in Authoritarian Societies? China’s community remained considerably stronger than that in the West during the global era because of the country’s long hierarchic tradition, the recency of its controlled tolerance of the markets, and its relative sociocultural homogeneity. Nevertheless, economic growth and the Deng regime’s highhandedness regarding the effects of its policies wreaked considerable havoc with community in China. Vast internal migration broke and upended community. The one-child policy also disrupted community, conferring significant power on the only children within and weakening authority in families. Yet China was pointed toward communal devastation comparable to that in the worst Soviet and Rumanian areas, where the problem was nihilist totalitarianism’s stripping of traditions, and demoralization.

Community remained far stronger in Muslim societies during the global era than in most others owing in part to restricted capitalism and economic development. The political authoritarianism and weakness of the rule of law and civil liberties in most Muslim countries also permitted stern consensuses to violently enforce tradition, drastically curtailing sociocultural mixing. All of this was grounded in the Islamic Resurgence’s profound authoritarianism and barring of openness and tolerance. The closed, strictly patriarchal, sociocultural matrix of most Muslim societies, which included the prevalence of highly authoritarian personalities, at the same time fostered ceaseless factionalism and conflict – visà-vis those of other religions, other Muslim traditions, other states, other tribes, other warlords, and other clans, as well as against Israel and the West. Outsiders, whoever they might be, were scapegoated as shifting groups of insiders were brought together amid the rejection of reconciliation. Pakistan’s bitter ethnic, sectarian, and regional rivalries exemplified this endemic strife. Under the Islamic Resurgence, it was forever “us against them” in an ongoing culture of violence. Among many other consequences, this conflict further strengthened community, in its fractured way. Even the most developed Muslim societies did not escape the seething discord. The global era’s new forms of community rooted in emerging techtremely convenient and hugely engaging while allowing effortless, instantaneous reach all over the world. The intensity with which people kept up with hundreds of friends on social websites was remarkable. Yet such mediated community took time away from more meaningful, direct, person-to-person contact with family and friends, and those immersed in it also lost a good deal of the give and take and ability to reconcile that come with face-to-face relations. The sociality that the new technologies supported had little of the vibrant palpability of face-to-face communication and none of the serene contemplativeness of letter writing. Some heart may be taken, however, from the fact that technological change has been swiftly moving toward higher-capacity communication able to support fuller, less intrusively mediated new forms of sociality. Stressed community was the inevitable concomitant of global-liberal societies’ extraordinary economic and sociocultural development, but the ensuing effects on community needed to be watched and managed based on the model of how some of the most developed societies were mitigating environmental impacts.

Stressed community was the inevitable concomitant of global-liberal societies’ extraordinary economic and sociocultural development, but the ensuing effects on community needed to be watched and managed based on the model of how some of the most developed societies were mitigating environmental impacts. As Switzerland’s environmentally friendly tunnels and bridges protect mountains and forests, preserving hillsides that would often have been bulldozed in the United States or China, social policies needed to be as careful as possible with the community they affect. Community is at once fragile and resilient. When damaged, it returns, but like an alpine meadow, it does so slowly. That the economic imperative succeeded brilliantly during most of the global era was most beneficial, but community needed to be encouraged and nurtured as well, especially the family. Let us now take up the morality of the era, keeping in mind among other things its implications for community. The sociocultural uprisings of their first decade shattered large portions of the existing moral hierarchy and replaced them with far greater competition in the moral markets, indeed with moral laissez faire, in which many different moralities competed openly for acceptance. This wrenching upheaval brought great moral diversity to the United States. (By morality in this chapter, I most often mean in the sense of particular ethical forms, the concrete norms, virtues, or ways reigning or not reigning in people’s daily lives; but I sometimes mean the degree to which actions or patterns contribute to the long-term well-being of society as a whole, which is to say, absolute morality.305) Large portions of the established moral order were overthrown, leaving what remained of right and wrong and virtuous and vicious, weak and confused. Many whose character and conduct had been held exemplary under the previous order ceased finding them considered such. As uncertainty arose regarding what rules to follow and whom to emulate, many of the traditional moral ways came to seem arbitrary and confining and were cast aside. By the mid-1970s, large portions of advanced global-liberal populations had gone over to various countercultures. A good deal of the moral variation everywhere apparent had been there all along and had simply come out by then, but much of it was also new. Americans gained enormous freedom to conduct their lives as they saw fit and won respect for their lifestyle choices so long as these did not infringe upon the rights of others. There were numerous harbingers of the moral revolution of the late 1960s and early 1970s.

James Dean’s visceral resistance in Rebel Without a Cause and provocative slouch in Giant also anticipated the moral uprising, as did Lenny Bruce’s uproariously foul and biting comedy routines and one-man guerrilla war against censorship and puritanical moral order. The Man in the Grey Flannel Suit ridiculed the white-collar conformists of the 1950s, and MAD magazine spewed out universal irreverence to its young readers. Above all, the intensifying bohemian tradition, the American branch of which was concentrated in New York, San Francisco, and a few other large cities, reached new levels of public awareness during the beatnik movement of the 1950s. Jack Kerouac, one of its most influential voices, sang comprehensive moral rebellion and abandonment to the senses in his novel On the Road. The movement’s charismatic literature, music, and lifestyle flourished, reaching further into the populations of liberal societies than had any previous alternative expression, before subsiding. The strands of rebellion wove in and out of each other. Many university students participated in civil-rights protests in the South during the summers of 1963 and 1964. When they returned to campus, those from Berkeley organized demonstrations and sit-ins protesting discriminatory practices at various Bay Area businesses. The Free Speech Movement was sparked during the fall of 1964 when the University of California administration attempted to block the organizing of illegal protest activities from the campus. Many of the same young radicals then directed the methods of nonviolent protest they had learned in the South against the university administration. The U.S. student movement which spread from that beginning played a key role in the moral revolution. The movement soon began demanding greater personal freedom as well. University administrations dropped most in loco parentis regulation of students’ lives within a few years. After a short interlude during the early 1960s following the waning of the beatnik movement, a buzz of excitement began to stir around Ken Kesey and his circle in Palo Alto and nearby La Honda, California. There, many of the anarchic new cultural patterns of the hippie movement, including experimentation with psychedelic drugs, spontaneous art forms, and alternative lifestyles, were being created to little notice from 1963 to mid-1965. In late 1965, this vibrant new expression of long-simmering moral rebellion went public and began swelling into a mass phenomenon. The scene moved up the peninsula to San Francisco where human be-ins and new sorts of music concerts began taking place.

The scene moved up the peninsula to San Francisco where human be-ins and new sorts of music concerts began taking place. Talented rock musicians, including Big Brother and the Holding Company, the Jefferson Airplane, and the Grateful Dead, created the new forms and became key disseminators of the hippie package of sex, drugs, and music. During January 1966 the nascent movement and era reached an initial crescendo as television networks gave it feverish attention, and news magazines blew it up into cover stories. That winter, a full-blown counterculture came into being. From across the country, youth began flocking to San Francisco to experience the new rage. By that summer, Haight-Ashbury and the nearby panhandle were filled with colorfully dressed, grinning, anarchic, drugged-out hippies. The movement expanded dramatically as the mostly middle-class pilgrims began scattering back home, forming colonies as they returned. From its peak in San Francisco during the “summer of love” in 1967, the movement diffused to receptive cities, university campuses, and rural pockets all over the country, but most densely on the two coasts. Long-haired and often barefooted, the hippies were naïve sociocultural revolutionaries who opted out of school and work, openly flouted traditional norms and virtues, and advocated peace and love. Yet there were so many of them, and their music and lifestyle were so charismatic that large numbers of young people all over the United States and beyond came under their spell. They had little of the beatniks’ intellectuality, but precisely that helped them achieve the wider appeal that had eluded their predecessors. With large portions of a whole generation in bohemian moral uprising, there was little the flabbergasted custodians of the old order could do in a liberal society but grudgingly tolerate them. Thus began the revolution to dismantle the traditional, Protestant, middle-class morality and replace it with a marketplace in which many different personal moralities were offered for the choosing or rejecting, and little was mandatory. Since the late 1960s, within broad limits, individuals have largely been free in the United States and other developed liberal societies to set and follow their own personal morals or none at all. As Fred Siegel puts it, the sociocultural changes of the 1960s amounted to “moral deregulation,”306 or in Daniel Patrick Moynihan’s famous phrase, they amounted to “defining deviancy down.”307 Already by the 1960s, liberals were defending a wide range of traditional vices against moral authority. Within the minimal new limits, no way of life was deemed too outrageous to be practiced or even put forth as a model.

Within the minimal new limits, no way of life was deemed too outrageous to be practiced or even put forth as a model. By the end of the 1990s, acceptability moved all the way to consenting sadomasochism, and “spanking” became something that could be talked about on national television in an approving, albeit gingerly, way. Society witnessed a libertarian avalanche extending tolerance and rights to nonmarital sexuality, homosexuality, pornography, abortion, gambling and, increasingly, marijuana use. Even witchcraft and Satanism became practices that people had every right to pursue. Moral permissiveness became sufficiently extreme that discovering how little was left against which to rebel sometimes made those bitten by the impulse to negate quite desperate for new targets. The unrestricted free access to moralities prevailing in the West and increasingly elsewhere exceeded even the unusual moral diversity and tolerance of the Roman Empire. The moral hierarchy of the national era both limited and protected people – they have been on their own since. Impelled by the earlier example of racial protest, several prominent categories of moral dissidents withdrew from and ceaselessly contested the old moral consensus from the 1960s, becoming aggressively uncooperative with it. Many illicit drug users justified their indulgence by maintaining that they were responsible or moderate users or that what they did was no worse than consuming alcohol or tobacco. Numerous moral entrepreneurs and their supporters pushed beyond demanding toleration toward demanding full acceptance or even toward essentially declaring the once deviant as ideal and the once moral as unacceptable. A striking early example occurred when organized homosexuals hijacked the word “gay” in all its youthful radiance to adorn themselves. Single parenthood not only became accepted by many but was sometimes extolled by celebrities and often by bottom-half teenagers. Refusing opprobrium, the moral dissidents demanded the moral and legal rights to conduct their lives as they would, and they won them. The countercultural revolution against the established consensual regime was often conducted as moral guerrilla warfare affronting the middle-class moral sensibility. Its tactics, frequently ingenious, outrageous, and effective, ran the gamut from hair length and grooming patterns to foul language, leering innuendo, and flagrant, mocking violation of traditional norms and virtues. The word “queer” was first banned as offensive to gays, and then adopted by them to flaunt their difference and highlight the injustice of their past and continuing mistreatment. The moral revolution was palpable in such phenomena as the exaggeratedly effeminate action of some gay men, parralleling the exaggeratedly ethnic action of some minorities. The bourgeois were harassed by radical transgressions of censorship under the cover of art,308 as they were by humorous transgressions like streaking and “mooning.”", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634243384_cleaned.txt:162:fd513ecc89a4", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 1352, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634243384_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634243384", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634243384_cleaned", "chunk_index": 163, "text": "and virtues.

The bourgeois were harassed by radical transgressions of censorship under the cover of art,308 as they were by humorous transgressions like streaking and “mooning.” Much of the moral war was fought obliquely, as through appeals by the young to peers behind the backs of adults. Negating the traditional consensus and pushing toward a minimalist new one, the unabashedly different employed radical anarchist stunts to counterattack rather than quietly allow their actions to be derogated and their choices limited. The underclass contributed more than its share to the moral uprising through sullen resentment, disrespect, and refusal to work or lead stable family life. The rhetoric of moral uprising featured the combative use of skepticism and debunking, often on behalf of moral laissez faire and often on behalf of that labeled wrong or vicious. The status quo ante was attacked as priggish, narrow, middle-class, authoritarian, discriminatory, and hypocritical. Heavy irony was a staple trope. Wielding radical relativism, the multiculturalists redefined moral judgments as “‘judgmental’ and ‘moralistic,’ [while] to engage in moral discourse became to ‘preach’ and ‘moralize’, and to pronounce upon moral affairs became to wage ‘moral crusade’ or, worse, ‘religious crusade.’”309 After decades of onslaught, Himmelfarb found American “moral language denoting outrage debased and disparaged.”310 Along with in-your-face parading of difference by those once labeled immoral, conflictualist stonewalling was a prominent feature of the contest. The putatively and/or truly immoral no longer acknowledged being such any more than did tyrannical political regimes – they fought back ferociously and dangerously. Foucault combatted those who would look askance at him as did the Kim regime of North Korea. Here, as elsewhere, multiculturalism brought a negational, conflictualist modus operandi. In the process, personal moral issues came to be conceptualized largely in terms of justice toward particular lifestyle groups, of their implications for interested social groups rather than for society as a whole. Some even took the reappraisal of much that had been labeled deviant in the past circularly as evidence for dismissing ethical judgment altogether. Judgment on matters of substantive private morality was often viewed from the mid-1960s as itself vicious and morally offensive, quite a feat for skepticism. Such extremes of relativism were reached that parents sometimes were not even allowed to feel comfortable raising their children under one creed or morality, out of holy deference to the radical-individualist and radical-relativist notion that all sides ought to be heard and the person to make up her own mind. Some may have dropped out of the economy, but many were dropping out of the community and consensus.

Some may have dropped out of the economy, but many were dropping out of the community and consensus. In the manner of philosophical skeptics, the radical relativists usually had moral views but were elusive and sketchy about them. Gambling was increasingly legalized and accepted. State lotteries began spreading widely in the 1960s following New Hampshire’s lead. Casino gambling spread to Atlantic City in 1976, Biloxi in 1980, and the Mississippi River from 1983.311 From the 1980s, states allowed Native Americans to build casinos on tribal lands, and these enterprises prospered overall and rapidly proliferated. Illicit drugs in general remained illegal, but there was substantial erosion of disapproval and decriminalization of cannabis use. Pornography in all but a handful of extremely repugnant forms such as child pornography became legal and readily available over the Internet and elsewhere. Not surprisingly, the incidence of norm violation and vice by traditional standards increased markedly from 1965. Deviance as socially constructed during the national era had not been unusual, but in most categories it was relatively tame and discreet, while in certain others it had been off-limits, at least to all but those in restricted circles. Now by the traditional labels it became widespread and blatant. For example, during the 1930s, illicit drug use was largely the possession of a few bohemians and isolated enclaves in the lower class, aside, that is, from the medically addicted. Drug use increased rapidly during the 1960s and early 1970s, reached peaks in the mid-to-late 1970s, and later returned to approximately the level of 1970, which, with comparatively minor ups and downs, held afterward until the major upticks late in the era associated with legalization.312 Personal lives chaotic to the degree depicted in Hemingway’s The Sun Also Rises or Kerouac’s On the Road now became common. Edmund Burke’s worst fears concerning moral chaos are not the half of what became everyday reality more than five centuries into modernity.313 As the simultaneous backdrop and metaphor of society’s fractured moral consensus, asylums were closed in the late 1960s and early 1970s and the mentally ill abruptly discharged into group homes and/or turned loose on the streets. Ambulatory schizophrenics raw from dumpster-diving now jabbered and barked at pedestrians while panhandling for the illicit drugs and alcohol with which to alternately engage and flee the demons of their cracked poetics.

Rendered politically feasible by advances in pharmacology, the new policy issued from an unlikely coalition of civil libertarians and fiscal conservatives. Never mind that the psychotic frequently sold or declined to take medications, or that their prescriptions were often askew. Civil libertarians were also instrumental in dismantling or ignoring previously existing laws governing public nuisances such as vagrancy, loitering, begging, and disorderly conduct; not to mention littering, public urination, and the theft of supermarket carts. The combination of shuttered mental hospitals, liberalized interpretations of disability, and tolerated disruptive conduct installed endowed choruses of madness and disorder in U.S. urban centers and to a lesser extent those of other global-liberal societies. Inhabiting bedlam, the global era’s urbanites needed greater income for purchasing insulation from the underclass. With consensus largely gone, decisions were more often made and enforced by means of politics and power and less often on the basis of consensus and respect.314 Relationships between parents and children are an arena in which consensus weakened and politics strengthened, for children were frequently paid or otherwise rewarded from the late 1960s to do chores they once would have been persuaded to do with moral force. Relationships between teachers and students became more instrumental in a similar way as behavior modification rather than moral authority became the default means of maintaining classroom discipline, and medication increasingly supplemented it. The weakening of consensus was such that people often found it less uncomfortable to walk out of relationships and friendships than to work through difference or to finesse and tolerate it. The United States and other liberal societies increasingly relied more upon legislatures, courts, and police through which collective decisions were mechanically produced and enforced, and less upon earnest conversation toward agreement. Larger-scale consensus had been forged spontaneously in the past. When achieved at all during the later decades of the era, it was more often engineered by large economic and political interests and contrived by PR firms operating much as advertising agencies would to mold household product demand. Decisions tended to be reached via negotiations between those directing blocs of controlled opinion.315 As citizen political involvement declined, “the number of political organizations, partisan and nonpartisan, with regular paid staff … exploded….” Impersonal “letterhead” organizations, such as AARP, having “more in common with mail-order commercial organizations than with old-fashioned face-to-face associations,” were examples.316 In an era of weak consensus and power politics, the operative rules tended to be legal and the prevailing norms and virtues fewer and thinner.

The Norm of No Norms and the Consensus Remaining. Consensus has not disappeared in the area of personal morality, but what is left of it has been transformed into a much thinner, more restricted, and more abstract one than was in force during the 1950s and early 1960s. The new moral consensus, such as it is, above all emphasizes the need for the inclusion and tolerance of difference, in lifestyle along with race and ethnicity. What largely prevails today is Isaiah Berlin’s weak rather than strong consensus, in other words, that in which the moral markets rather than moral hierarchy are respected.317 In its radical relativism, this new consensus endorses a code of “no norms” whose sole commandment is that there be no explicit moral evaluation other than the minimum transparently required to sustain a liberal society. Thus, the libertarian moral rule that action not be judged unless it objectively interferes with other persons or their property. Denizens of global-liberal American society tended to abstain from judgment in the area of personal morality. Nearly everyone agreed upon being much less hemmed in by moral standards – which is to say, they substantially accepted the moral markets. Personal morality has not simply weakened and thinned in the moral marketplace but has frequently been supplanted by the indignant rejection of any authority whatsoever. Tolerance of difference was the extolled virtue and intolerance the loathed vice during the global era. The law followed suit, largely withdrawing from the area of private morals. Yet the acts of everyday kindness among families, friends, neighbors, and co-workers – if fewer than 60 years ago – provided evidence not of blanket amorality or immorality but of embattled morality withdrawn to restricted zones of safety and caring, in what has become for many a divided and troubling world. As they have often no longer thought of themselves as part of a larger society so much as members of ethnic, lifestyle, or other groups, most people’s zones of caring have receded. Their moral concern has diminished along with their joining. Moreover, if the ethics of personal conduct has become a wide-open moral marketplace, that specifically pertaining to physical or psychological injury and property damage to others has in many areas witnessed strengthened consensus since 1965.

For example, it has become even more strictly forbidden than it was in the past for one to lift a finger against a spouse or partner in anger. Sexual assault and rape have become more broadly defined and steadfastly opposed by informal norms as well as by the law. Elaborate new norms, conventions, and laws have arisen to regulate on-the-job conduct between the sexes. Using corporal punishment against children in school or even at home has become socially unacceptable in many cases and frequently illegal as well. Considerable attention has been aimed toward halting bullying in schools. Much increased pressure has been directed against smoking in general and doing so around others in particular. Global-liberal societies also reached consensus that racial or ethnic prejudice is morally unacceptable and discrimination in any form a serious offense. A new consensus, if uneven and less full, was also reached that sexism is unacceptable. The kind of sexual harassment that was winked at sixty years ago, an inappropriate pat on the rear or comment about a woman’s body, is now disapproved and less common. Comparable consensus also arose around the need to respect difference in sexual preference. Although contested peripherally, consensus arose as well regarding political correctness: Which topics may be brought up and attributions of fact and causation communicated having even quite indirect negative implications for equality of racial, ethnic, gender, and lifestyle groups. This extensive, sensitive code supplemented the respect paid to once-disparaged groups. The Upheaval in Moral Tone. The wide-open, contentious moral markets of the global era were accompanied by a complete upheaval of style. Cachet was to a considerable extent lifted from the traditionally reputable and conferred upon the traditionally disreputable, who frequently became the solicited, respected, admired, and imitated ones. During the 1960s, the upright became “uptight,” and everyone was told to “loosen up” or “lighten up.” For many of the young the “grand tour” was no longer travel abroad but sexual experimentation, drugs, and cross-town low life in the form of “slumming” that mixed entertainment, illicit substances, bohemia, and identification with social outcasts.318 “Bad” became good, “outrageous” hilarious, and “wicked” virtuoso or alluring. In the era’s veritable “emporium of styles,”319 few were edifying and many not.

The dominant style of the national era had been one version or another of upbeat, middle-class order and neatness. A mild, secure regime that relatively easily tolerated challenge, it had coexisted from the 1920s on with the detached and ironic counter-style of cool.320 Cool was for the most part only gently subversive and anti-bourgeois, although for some jazz musicians and big-city sorts it was more than that. Only incipiently subversive, it pushed the limits of propriety but tended to do so moderately and playfully. During the global era, cool became radicalized into hip, which unambiguously rejects the moral order and inverted its values. The icons of hip from William Burroughs to the Velvet Underground captured abandonment to anarchic sexual freedom, drug use, and negativism. The style of the outs, as in the baggy pants of prison chic, was prominent, while virtue was in short supply. The character of hip was anti-character. Sinking and Swimming in the Moral Markets. The wide-open sociocultural agoras tossed and churned everyone, leaving the worlds of many fractured and incoherent.321 Morality and immorality had been clearly defined during the national era, but they no longer were during the global era. The multiculturalists extended respect by transforming those labeled deviant under the old order into victims and directing sympathy toward them. Gays, in all but a few locations, lived in mortal terror of their fellow citizens and the law as late as the 1960s and early 1970s, and still have to be careful in many provincial conservative areas. The sexually libertine or gay or those who divorced, gambled, or engaged in other action traditionally labeled deviant encountered greatly more acceptance and freedom than they had during the 1950s, but many in the middle and working classes who had once felt at home in their societies now perceived chaos and felt anguish.322 Nowhere were the moral revolution and moral markets met with greater glee than among the underclass. It was as if tax evaders had been issued rebates. Released from middle-class moral restrictions, drug use soared spectacularly among the disorderly, and the haze of intoxication became their prime state of being. Others who indulged lowered themselves to the same level as they did so. Without either coherent socialization or supportive pressure from family and community, those in the underclass stumbled into every vicious trap posed by the moral markets. Striking about what happened to morality in the United States was that most young people were seduced into significant wrongdoing or vice during their formative years. This personal experience compromised them, fed the desire in many to justify what they had done, and helped lead them to assume the negational stance of the outsider against their society.", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634243384_cleaned.txt:168:40df4a0e8945", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 1358, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634243384_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634243384", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634243384_cleaned", "chunk_index": 169, "text": "coherent socialization or supportive pressure from family and community, those in the underclass stumbled into every vicious trap posed by the moral markets.

Jaded, many found siding with disorder less onerous than defending or leading an orderly life. Drugs in particular were the perfect experiential wedge between generations and lifestyles. As the baby-boom generation grew older and increasingly attained positions of authority, enforcing moral norms and virtues was particularly fraught for it because of its own past and often continuing deviance. Middle-class young people’s engagement in forbidden sex and drugs during the late 1960s and early 1970s filtered down in no time into the working class, where it wrought immediate communal and moral destruction. As fewer and fewer workers were ensconced in stable families and communities, their accustomed moral adaptation disintegrated. They no longer found the support and guidance upon which they had depended for orderly lives. One thinks of the substance abuse and absenteeism common among blue-collar workers. Drug use, like family disorder, became a much greater problem in the working class than in any other class except for the underclass. Those in the working class found sanctuary scarce. Understandably apprehensive about the newly pervasive moral tumult, many in the middle class clung to their families, neighborhoods, and religious communities for protection. They too received far less sociocultural support than they had earlier. The moral disintegration and downward mobility among many middle-class young people were particularly shocking. Initially, conservatives managed little more than a dazed reaction to the sociocultural upheaval of the late 1960s and early 1970s. They were thrown off balance by its suddenness, radicalism, and charisma. Merle Haggard’s country and western hit song “I’m an Okie from Muskogee” was a product of the time. For a decade the tide of sociocultural revolution ran effectively unopposed and swept much tradition away, while those resisting the transformation were for the most part confused and quiescent. By the late 1970s, a conservative reaction was at last coalescing, and by the 1980s it was almost able to hold its own, slowing further liberal advance but only for a time. The middle class struggled to hold on to traditional principles and virtues with their now disorientingly uneven moral reception. Insofar as the traditionalists found themselves, they did so for the most part by willfully asserting their morals against the reigning skepticism and chaos.

Conflictualists that they are, liberal gamers – including those in, close to, or sympathetic to the media and culture – did not take kindly to the conservative reaction, which was thrown back in the area of morals. Gay lifestyles were difficult for most from traditional, fundamentalist, provincial, or poorly educated backgrounds to accept, but they increasingly accepted them as the new consensus strengthened. Their substantial recognition of and extension of rights to gay people in everyday life through the early 21^(st) century consolidated this major expansion of the moral markets and represented important reconciliation. Yet the conservative lifestyle of the global era was not natural and breezy like that of the national era; nor did its middle class muster the dignity of demeanor or aura of the celebratory of its predecessors. For the bourgeois no longer dwelled in a secure moral world – they were embattled. The gamers who occupied the top rungs were of an altogether different temper from the generally sympathetic and discreet members of the upper and upper-middle classes of the early and mid- ⋅ 20^(th) century. Now all too visible were the arrogance, brashness, hipness, and contempt of anti-bourgeois gamers. As the era’s middle class struggled to resist the seductive, threatening, and critical presence of the masterly gamers, they were no longer chipper but harried. Shifts from one class morality to another have taken place before in liberal societies, but widespread, significant moral disorder was unprecedented in them. Moral Decline. The United States underwent serious moral decline from 1965. What I mean is that the actions of large numbers of Americans no longer contributed effectively to the long-term wellbeing of their society as they had during the national era.323 As Popenoe said, “People no longer treat others as they once did; they no longer feel the same sense of commitment and obligation to others.”324 The concern all too often became exclusively with the self, ignoring or placing far back the needs of spouses, children, friends, neighbors, and fellow citizens. Rates of drug use, welfare fraud, tax evasion, shoplifting, marital faithlessness, and cheating on examinations all increased. Rates of violent crime were down from their highs in the early 1990s due to smarter and more vigorous policing, prison building, and target hardening, not to moral betterment; and those rates were again on the rise by the end of the era. Moral progress continued with respect to a few multiculturalist concerns but little else.

Moral progress continued with respect to a few multiculturalist concerns but little else. Moral sentiments of social empathy remained, but action based upon them tended to be ad hoc and ineffectual, if not counterproductive. Charitable giving remained comparatively high in the United States primarily because subsidized by the tax code; volunteering, though down, remained as frequent as it did because budding gamers needed to pad their college applications or resumés and the elderly needed to fend off loneliness. The traditional norms and virtues largely fell into desuetude, and few seemed to give any thought to the country as a whole, other than how it might affect their narrow interests or group agendas. After the moral demolition was advanced, a few indeterminate, New-Age platitudes floated to the surface, and moral bits and pieces emanated here and there from fortified islands of middle-class religion and morality, but morality was in shambles. Even as the individual and collective moral casualties continue to climb, it was much of the way back to ethical nothingness. A great deal slipped away in the moral avalanche from 1965. Moral Consensus in Europe and Japan. Europe’s moral consensus also changed, but it remained stronger in most respects than that in the United States. Considerable moral virtue continued to be modeled in Europe, particularly in northern continental Europe. Illicit drug use was less widespread in Europe. Europe remained morally expansive overall, while significant portions of American society tipped into moral reaction.325 The most notable exception was Europe’s Muslim minority, a large portion of which insistently followed its own conservative morality. Yet where Europeans embraced moral reaction, considerable friction arose with the dominant liberals as it did in the United States. Rocco Battagliani was acrimoniously rejected as President of the EU in 2004 over his traditional social-moral values, for example. If less contentious and conflictual generally than their American counterparts, the European upper and upper-middle classes also showed disdain for traditional morality. Europe’s relatively few social conservatives were for the most part browbeaten into mildness without much fanfare. The Japanese consensus, albeit weakened from what it had been during the first two postwar decades, remained exceptionally strong by international standards. Japanese management and politics are able to rely upon consensus to a degree impossible in the West. With relatively little diversity, consensus in Japan was strong enough to significantly limit the moral markets.

Japan was distinctive not only for its continuing strength of community and consensus but for the degree to which these were hierarchical. The Liberalizing Third World. The moral markets were less open in most third-world societies than in the first world. Nevertheless, from starting points of greatly more settled hierarchy, their consensuses underwent extraordinary tumult and were much weakened during the global era. As the moral markets spread in third-world societies, moral disorder radiated out from urban centers. Ethnically diverse societies like Brazil and much of sub-Saharan Africa underwent major disruption of consensus, but the disruption was also advanced in Southeast Asia and throughout Latin America. An especially poisonous demoralization afflicted such countries as Colombia, Mexico, and portions of Thailand in which illicit drug production and trafficking were rampant. Involvement in the drug trade was so corrupting that several Latin American countries became narco-states. By contrast, India’s traditional moral consensus remained surprisingly strong, undergoing only moderate disruption during the last 25 years of the era. Nevertheless, incivility of a sort seldom seen earlier began being encountered in that country during the 1980s. China and the Islamic World. Morally repressive under the Red Guard and Cultural Revolution, China turned somewhat morally expansive under the Deng regime, with its cities in particular experiencing greater play of the moral markets. Informal social control loosened considerably, and the moral markets gained more room.326 Divorce laws were liberalized, and the stigma against marital dissolution lessened.327 Although still comparatively low, China’s divorce rate increased significantly. Block leaders largely disappeared, going the way of the United States’ neighborhood busybodies and France’s intrusive concierges. Neighborhood authorities who once held moral sway over family matters and could force couples to remain together against their will, weakened and tended to avoid involvement. Yet both extended and nuclear family ties remained robust in China, limiting the effects of the moral markets. Chinese families extensively assisted their members but also still controlled them. China became only a little more tolerant of gay lifestyles, for example. A lesbian woman would seldom dare to openly act upon her preference and live her lifestyle in China; for if she did, her family would ostracize her and cut her off from the many benefits it provided. A gay man would not face as much pressure and would have more options, but he, too, would face difficulties. Since connections still determined opportunities and careers in China, if a family or person fell into disrepute, they lost massively.328 External rather than internal forces kept people from openly challenging the consensus.", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634243384_cleaned.txt:172:805ee3b04e50", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 1362, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634243384_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634243384", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634243384_cleaned", "chunk_index": 173, "text": "upon her preference and live her lifestyle in China; for if she did, her family would ostracize her and cut her off from the many benefits it provided.

From long experience living in that country, Fallows observed, “China seems like a bunch of individuals who behave themselves only when they think they might get caught.”329 If Chinese consensus remains relatively strong with regard to the family, it weakened considerably in politics. Where other societies have mostly accommodated the moral markets and accepted varying degrees of freedom, nowhere was the reaction against the moral markets stronger than in Muslim societies. The Islamic world’s moral consensus strengthened and became more authoritarian, suppressing individual choice. The Islamic Resurgence was so intense and the rule of law and civil liberties so weak that violators of traditional ways, norms, and virtues were often summarily dealt violence by the consensus around them. Among the world’s large traditions, only in the Muslim world were accused adulterers stoned to death and independent-minded teenage girls regularly murdered or disfigured. Seven-eighths of Egyptians favored the murder of apostates and adulterers.330 A similar fraction of Pakistanis did. Islamic societies’ traditional consensuses had been rigid enough that Muslims had been spared most other countries’ discomfort with proximate moral markets. Their moral regime was associated with extreme personal authoritarianism and intolerance. Fundamentalist Muslims were nearly as violent toward their co-religionists of divergent sectarian persuasion as they were toward non-Muslims. Under Iran’s coercive regime, for example, the intolerant rural moral police (the besaaj) of humble origins terrorized cosmopolitan, venturesome, middle-class urbanites.331 The Islamic profile of coerced consensus in the micro arena and severe dissension in the macro was the polar opposite of that in global-liberal societies, while also quite different from that in China. relatively prudish and parochial national liberal society in its morals, become overnight the most tumultuous, anarchic, and cosmopolitan of global-liberal societies; a stupendous sociocultural bazaar in which everyone had to find their own path among myriads of proffered norms, virtues, and ways? The advent of global capitalism was in numerous ways a factor behind the rise of the moral markets and weakening of consensus. Capitalist economic growth and technologies of transportation and communication made migration and exchange relatively affordable all over the globe, leading to massive sociocultural diversity. Capitalist geographical mobility between and within countries disrupted community, consensus, and morality. The capitalist media delivered floods of content to, from, and about immensely varied societies and cultures all over the world. The much-increased education and personal development made possible by market-driven economic growth also enabled today’s kaleidoscopic moral variety.", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634243384_cleaned.txt:173:1c92d1ca031a", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 1363, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634243384_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634243384", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634243384_cleaned", "chunk_index": 174, "text": "moral markets and weakening of consensus.

The much-increased education and personal development made possible by market-driven economic growth also enabled today’s kaleidoscopic moral variety. Since the experience of economic markets leaves more rational-instrumentalism and less emotionality, politics and negotiation now came more naturally than consensus with its appeal to common norms and virtues. That is part of why exhortation was increasingly directed to interests rather than obligations. If appeal to shared commitments is no longer able to bring people to cease and desist from activities that interfered with others, they had to invoke politics and the law, move elsewhere, or continue to suffer. Experience of the economic markets also undermined consensus by increasing individualism and decreasing collectivism. Politics was displacing consensus for reasons analogous to those behind economy displacing community, beginning with increased rationality and individualism from experience with economic markets. As people withdraw from community under pressure from the global markets, they withdraw from the consensus it bears. By becoming one-sidedly concerned with the economic and working long hours, they sequestered the social influence their less driven and less harried forebears exercised. They had fewer informal social connections to activate and less time available with which to teach, model, monitor, and enforce morality. Another condition lying behind liberal societies’ weakening and changing consensus was the way in which technology and the media displaced the direct human contact that sustains vibrant consensus, interposing themselves between adults and children, friends and acquaintances, and the elderly and everyone else, while frequently bypassing neighbors altogether. As attention turned from face-to-face social interaction to television sets, computer monitors, game consoles, and hand-held devices, chains of direct personal influence withered. Nowhere was this displacement more strongly felt than in socialization, where the sundering of generations and explosion of youth culture revolved around shared experience in generationally segregated media. Cut out of the loop, parents and members of the community were no longer as able to wield informal social power to inculcate or enforce norms and virtues. Mediated human relationships at the same time brought out further individualism, making consensus more difficult to achieve. A crucial explanation for the American moral transformation lay in the discreditation of established moral authority during the 1960s and early 1970s. The main indictments of the country and its incompletely universalistic white upper, upper-middle-, and middle-classes of the national era were for injustice toward racial and ethnic minorities.

Charges of racist beliefs and practices were followed by those of sexism, homophobia, and the suppression and exploitation of third-world peoples such as Hondurans, Iranians, and Vietnamese. As national-liberal societies and particularly their dominant classes were blamed for injustice, much what was associated with them was rejected, making room for a new respect for moral difference. The racial and ethnic uprisings prompted by that guilty verdict paved the way toward toppling the established moral order. The subsequent extension of sympathy and respect to unjustly treated lifestyle groups opened the doors to the moral markets and their striking diversity of unfamiliar norms, virtues, and ways. Respect for lifestyle diversity rendered the moral markets overpowering. Understandably annoyed with narrow aspects of the traditional Christian moral consensus, American Jews played an important role in toppling the Protestant middle-class moral order remaining hegemonic through the early 1960s. As perennial wanderers, Jews have long borne and developed the perspective of the outsider. Traumatized by centuries of anti-Semitism, pogroms, and finally the Holocaust, their experience has understandably tended toward acute sensitivity and even jumpiness regarding sociocultural rights. Many Jews have been highly uncomfortable with paternalistic moral concessions made to Christians of modest sociocultural means. They have felt apprehensive about lower-middleand working-class Christian intolerance in all its forms. Echoing the dismissive, traditional Yiddish “Goyim kaput” (gentiles are all messed up), numerous Coen brothers films humorously express an at once bemused, contemptuous, aggressive, and fearful sentiment of many Jews toward naïve gentiles. Their tendency has been toward distancing and protecting themselves and, more recently, toward supporting other vulnerable groups similarly situated. American Jewish intellectuals, writers, artists, and members of the culture indistry were the leading participants in the diffuse 1950s and 1960s cultural assault on conformity, which constituted one of the major currents flowing into the contemporary moral upheaval. Most American Jews strongly support the moral markets.332 Consensus is set back by new encounters and broadened horizons; however desirable these may be for other reasons. Even much of the Maslovian moral growth enabled by the reign of extreme tolerance stressed society by posing additional moral diversity and uncertainty. What Hayek says of political consensus holds for consensus in general: “As the range of persons extends among whom some agreement is necessary to prevent conflict, there will necessarily be less and less agreement on the particular ends to be achieved: agreement will increasingly be possible only on certain abstract aspects of the kind of society in which they wish to live.”333 Reaching consensus anew takes time, conversation, and mulling over.

The epochal but disorienting rise of the gamers lay behind much of the upending of moral consensus and rise of the moral markets. The gamers’ irresponsible action and negative example spread to much of the rest of the country, propelling its moral decline. Their radical relativism was a central source of the repudiation of traditional morality and arrival of moral chaos. Lacking a sense of the whole, the gamers declare moral judgment to be arbitrary. In their cynical critique interestedness, politics, and power lie behind every step of the process of moral regulation, from the initial imputation of immorality to its sanction. The higher reflexivity and social constructionism of the gamers outshone the traditional middle-class ethics, greatly undermining moral authority. Of the gamers, cultural gamers in the media, academia, the arts, and popular culture caused much of the grief.334 Economic gamers did not usually have the same personal stake in potentially disruptive sociocultural patterns. They also more often had to work closely with the middle class, giving them empathy for the latter. Yet most economic gamers fell under the influence of their cultural peers. Among cultural gamers, intellectuals were a major force opposing the traditional consensus and supporting the moral markets. Their publications and media exposure disseminated rebellious moral ideas through the population. Long experience of sociocultural independence led them to recoil from sociocultural authority. They were autonomous creators in their realm and accustomed to their distinct sort of freedom. Most such creators, for opinions related to their work, had experienced heated attacks from traditionalists seeking to invoke the established consensus, via the media if not personally. Cultural gamers chafed at restrictions on civil liberties, in part out of resentment arising from such attacks, which threatened their beings and livelihoods. The overrepresentation of intellectuals in the media gave them strategic positioning from which to criticize or ridicule the old order and defend the moral markets and counterculture.335 Skeptical scholars in the human sciences also undercut the existing consensus and its enforcement by giving powerful support to the opinions of other intellectuals. The sociology of deviance played a leading role in inverting the moral order and declaring the traditional norm-violators victims. Its message tapped deeply into the era’s tolerance of and sympathy for the marginal, along with its hesitancy to enforce traditional morality.

Sociology dramatically turned its identification from society as a whole to those labeled deviant, in such notable works as Erving Goffman’s Asylums, Howard Becker’s Outsiders, and David Matza’s Becoming Deviant. Edwin Schurr argued forcefully in Crimes without Victims that, when it came to such “victimless” crimes as gambling, prostitution, abortion, and homosexuality, people were harmed not by the illegal activities but by the laws and stigma against them.336 There was so much truck between many of the sociologists and the purported deviants they studied that their positions often merged with the self-justification of the putative deviants, whom their resources also provided with a sophisticated exculpatory rhetoric. Modern anthropology’s foundational skepticism and radical relativism were also influential in undermining traditional moral authority and opening doors of tolerance. Cultural relativism might have been no more than an analytic tool with which to systematically view varying structural patterns – along with admonition to students of ethnography to be cautious about imposing narrow assumptions and values that might easily be outflanked by reality. Instead, under modernist, anti-bourgeois impetus, anthropology’s cultural relativism developed into an overarching skeptical precept forbidding moral judgment. Its aspiration had been to present the widest possible array of human practices in morally neutral-to-sympathetic tones, tacitly brushing against its own norm of refraining from moral judgment. Anthropology’s moral message was so concentrated upon its construction of cultural relativism and so delightfully illustrated with back-fromthe-bush zaniness that this small field was punching above its weight and exerting a surprisingly large impact upon global-era morals. Psychology’s acceptance and relabeling of many formerly proscribed actions as healthy also contributed to establishing the moral markets. Freudian and other antinomian schools of psychology undermined the superego and middle-class morality. Thomas Szasz’s Myth of Mental Illness and other writings were influential. The therapy movement exposed large portions of the population to culture embracing the once forbidden. Its heavy emphasis on feelings undercut moral discipline. The popularization of therapy took its influence far beyond the tiny analyzed group of the national era. Leaguing itself with the id, a great deal of therapy was in evasive, self-indulgent denial of the immorality that brought on many of the problems it treats. The medicalization of deviance contributed further demoralization. Arguing that medicalization of illegal drug use offered a more effective and humane approach than stigmatization, many physicians and natural scientists came out for the decriminalization of illicit drugs.

Conveniently wielding science to dissolve guilt, many of the dissolute ceded blame for their condition to biology, abjuring personal responsibility. Large numbers of artists and writers also continued the rebellion they have been mounting since the early 19^(th) century, whose chief target was the traditional moral order. Taking the necessary disorder of their own creative progress as the ideal norm for all, they sought to impose anarchy generally. As they became liberated from censorship formal and informal, they too posed grave difficulties for middle-class propriety.337 Many artists and writers viewed conformity with traditional norms and virtues as anathema and felt compelled to push the limits of moral revolution. Approaching the global era, which was postmodernist in the arts and culture, J. D. Salinger’s Catcher in the Rye decried the phoniness everywhere present in the bourgeois order; Arthur Miller’s The Crucible flailed away at Christian moral tradition for witch trials that occurred under isolated, provincial circumstances centuries earlier; and Kesey’s One Flew over the Cuckoo’s Nest declared the ill sane and society a cruel, fascist asylum. Jean Genet and Norman Mailer attributed superiority to the underclass and deviant. Artists and writers’ heroes became anti-heroes who broke rules and held out against the moral consensus. Stanley Kubrick’s Alex in A Clockwork Orange338 took this rebellion to an extreme, unflinchingly directing random violence amid absurdist hilarity against a society of less than zero moral value. Greater wealth and more auctions and galleries also meant that larger numbers of artists could be supported in alienated bohemian lifestyles. As they had been during the national era, artists and writers were leading moral revolutionaries from the 1960s. Where modernist literature had been able to bring a few million quiet, mostly disciplined readers into contact with the rebellious culture of intellectuals, artists, and writers during the national era, providing them a certain familiarity with long-simmering anti-bourgeois ways of thought and life that would otherwise not have been known to them; the mass media exposed hundreds of millions in the West to moral dissent from the 1960s, vividly amplifying bohemian lifestyles. Large portions of a whole generation were won over to alternative lifestyles during the years of the hippie movement’s maximum catchiness. Timothy Leary played the pied piper, popularizing psychedelics as the panacea. Easy Rider339 peddled alienation, drugs, and hip lethargy.

Marijuana began spreading to middle-class youth from around 1960, but its use only became widespread a few years later as the media began presenting it as hip, essentially advertising it and other illicit drugs. Under the new openness, moral rebellion and the moral markets were supported and disseminated in the media as never before, further weakening consensus. Artists and bohemians had charisma during the national period, but they had been few in number and relatively isolated. Even as true bohemianism was disappearing, artists and intellectuals’ way of life was disseminated via the media and accepted by large portions of the public. Mass higher education, too, exposed large numbers to anti-bourgeois thinking and sensibility, greatly spreading the critical stance that few had possessed earlier, although it did so under circumstances that better facilitated coming to terms with the dissonant sociocultural content everywhere evident than was likely to be attained by those dropped into the media and life less prepared. Intellectuals and artists’ cultural influence considerably increased with the great expansion of universities during the 1950s and 1960s.340 Capitalist cultural entrepreneurs, who were at once cultural and economic gamers, have had strong economic interests in fanning the flames. The private media rarely hesitated to film or broadcast whatever made money that they could get away with – sex, drugs, violence, baseness, or foul language. Propriety not having sold well, the media presented bourgeois morality as tired, mean-spirited frump. The outrageous captured attention in such television programs as MTV’s Beavis and Butthead, films as The Last Temptation of Christ, 341 and music as gangsta rap. Advertising brought its own interested wedge of demoralization, stirring desire for goods and services by association with abandon, sex, profligacy, or whatever else was profitable. Although every bit as deadly, the ill effects of these cultural products were sometimes no more deliberate than those of the toxic effluent their economic brethren pumped into rivers and the air from manufacturing plants. The crude manipulation permeating television soap operas and hyperbolic amorality suffusing Hollywood movies, though, often reflected more than that they sold; they also reflected how the industry viewed the world. Those who would make their living fawning to a vulnerable public to its detriment for maximum profit – whether there, elsewhere in the economy, or in politics – tended by initial selection and again by experience to be cynical, those to whom civilization was an oyster to be pried open, cut at the root, and ingested alive.

The global era’s moral disorder was heavily conditioned by the entertainment industry. How Did Radical Relativism (with Some Exceptions) Become the New Consensus? Relativism became more radical and gained momentum during the civil-rights movement and then sharply more so with the ghetto riots and black power movement as they and their supporters increasingly utilized radical relativism to attack racism. Drawing upon cultural relativism, they appropriately asked who the bigots were, given the immense human variation found all over the world, to think that their narrow construals of reality were any more valid than those of the people whom they demeaned and mistreated. Feminists employed similar arguments against male chauvinism. A larger source of the era’s radical relativism came as the supporters of the traditional categories of deviance began widely and forcefully using analogous arguments against the wielders of moral authority. Their comprehensive moral skepticism left moral authority befuddled and speechless. Brandishing radical relativism, the sociocultural revolutionaries, the gamers, the broad upper-middle class, and their allies trounced the middle-class opposition on all of these issues and left them reeling. As traditionalists were successfully skewered by their talented opponents, skepticism became integral to the global-liberal paradigm. Never mind that radical relativism was inherently negative and devoid of moral substance – it worked for the overriding concerns of multiculturalism’s constituent groups. In their socially constructed alienations, the moral revolutionaries, cultural gamers, and allies were in no mood to consider the needs of their middle-class opponents, of children, or of anyone else and temper their skepticism. From their outsider points of view, all that was needed was overthrowing the old establishment and redistributing the social and symbolic benefits. Negativism and conflictualism having been in the air, most of the best educated and credentialed became alienated from and unconcerned with the whole, arrayed against their society rather than with it. Radical relativism has in large part been about release from moral responsibility. Consciously or unconsciously lying behind much effort to stave off enforcement of the traditional moral consensus was that many no longer wanted to be moral. Since acknowledging this fact was more than most were able to bear or bare, a great deal of blatant sophistry and nonsense filled the air. Saying no to objects of immoral desire is difficult for many, and fewer had the resolve with which to do so. Moral skepticism in large part represented refusal of this reality.

If some used the moral markets and moral diversity to move up the needs hierarchy, many more found in them a convenient if transparent justification for abandoning themselves. Since the gamers cared little about what others did or felt, radical relativism both expressed and abetted their alienation and unconcern. In their moral indifference, many found radical relativism convenient. Withdrawal from morality paralleled withdrawal from community. Why the Upheaval in Moral Tone? A natural home of the dominant hip lifestyle of the global era was the postmodernist nether realms of the underclass and those traditionally labeled deviant, including bohemians, rebellious youth, and dissenting minorities. Particularly vicious versions of the lifestyle were associated with the criminal class.343 The hip lifestyle emanated from such groups because it expressed the resentful or contemptuous sentiments of those with assorted moral chips on their shoulders. Its supporters bore grudges against middle-class morality – they had attitude. Hip gained a great deal of cultural power because many of those in whom it was based became a spurious leisure class generating charisma, for leisure nurtures flair. During the global period, this pseudo-elite emanated from those on one form of dole or another, freed from the burden of employment. Having far too much time on their hands, they were able to devote themselves and their underreported, not inconsiderable resources to popular culture and vicious pursuits. In so doing they were able to acquire the catchy styles of speech, manner, dress, and grooming with which to raise themselves to positions of sociocultural influence, facilitating the explosive diffusion of countercultural style. The slack welfare system of the 1960s and 1970s was an infamous source of leisure for large numbers of the disorderly, and many more later wiled away their days on one government pass or another, enabling them to cultivate their manner and charisma. Inmates had nothing but subsidized time on their hands, as did under-challenged, under-supervised, under-socialized, and underachieving youth. During the national era well-socialized middle-class homemakers had the leisure and cultural power, but now the alienated did. Amplified by entire industries, cultural rebellion became a mass phenomenon in which the vicious, as in the lifestyles of Santa Monica teenage runaways or New York heroin users, developed charisma and recruited to their lifestyles.344 Meanwhile, responsible, hard-working adults were busily advancing their careers and supporting families, leaving them unable to develop flair.

In its sturdy diligence the middle class had a difficult time competing. The media were another home of the hip lifestyle, facilitating its development in part by creating a large class of entertainers whose success required an acute sense of style. By selection and by professional experience, singers, announcers, screenwriters, actors, directors, comedians, models, advertising executives, and the many associated with them also tended to develop flair, and the most successful dwelled predominantly in the world of style.345 Given their emotional gifts and lifestyles, entertainers, actors, artists, and musicians easily acquired a sense of superiority to and rejected the middle class and its moral order. Notoriously libertine, their leanings contributed disproportionately to the radical expansion of the morally permissible. The aesthetic sense had long been promoted as well by urbanization, which provided exposure to great variation in personal style, stimulating perceptual acuity and giving access to many traditions, but increasingly much of this exposure took place via the media. Cinema and television communicated lifestyles far more widely than direct observation and more vividly than print or radio. Exposure to the hip often contributed to the descent of the vulnerable. Why the Abrogation of Informal Social Control? Those who were different and their sympathizers amassed a great deal of power in the moral markets, with which they contested enforcement of the traditional consensus through the era. Their newly organized pressure groups were a large source of this power. Earlier in the period, such amateurish efforts as the Sexual Freedom League and COYOTE (Call Off Your Old Tired Ethics), the whimsical organization of prostitutes in San Francisco, fought uphill battles against moral opposition. Organized PR campaigns soon become decisive political forces shaping opinion and policy. The National Organization for Reform of Marijuana Laws (NORML) labored ingeniously from the early 1970s to win acceptance for cannabis.346 During the first decade of the 21st century, the deft, tactical, and well-financed use of medicalization as an entry toward full legalization of marijuana brought that goal considerably nearer to realization. Rapidly picking up momentum, the movement then mounted successful campaigns for legalization in liberal states and cities. Wielding multiculturalism’s language of group difference and justice, the broadening gay rights movement powerfully asserted the rights of the LGBT community and won judicial victories. The gambling lobby became powerful and successful. Changing power constellations amid contentiousness and dwindling concern for societal consequences delivered much of the moral transformation. Government policies, especially constitutional ones, also helped overturn enforcement of the consensus.

The gambling lobby became powerful and successful. Changing power constellations amid contentiousness and dwindling concern for societal consequences delivered much of the moral transformation. Government policies, especially constitutional ones, also helped overturn enforcement of the consensus. During the 1950s, national policy in the United States supported what was a humane and wise normative order in many sectors, albeit with imperfections. Legal support for consensus substantially collapsed during the 1960s and early 1970s, making it difficult to sanction immorality. American society had a “homelessness” problem primarily because mental hospitals were shut down, drug offenses ignored, vagrancy euphemized, and nuisance laws unenforced. Nor have many difficult young people any longer been controllable by the great majority of teachers and administrators who were not exceedingly adept at wielding behavior modification or moral suasion now that the administration of corporal punishment in schools and often homes was deemed barbaric and/or made illegal. Bureaucracy, regulations, diversity, and radical relativism so bogged down public schools that they had great difficulty instilling or enforcing morality. The judiciary and academia were long the two strongest bastions of multiculturalism because institutionally fortified. Distant from the economic and many of the social markets, both were sufficiently aloof from the trials of the struggling members of the middle and working classes to ignore their widely felt moral anguish from the advancing sociocultural chaos. This phenomenon strikingly echoes the lag of the American judiciary far into the 19^(th) century as the lone citadel of elitist Federalism dug in against the advancing Jacksonian populism and spreading middle-class morality of the early 19^(th) century. Secure in their insularity, these quintessentially multiculturalist institutions were insensitive and unfeeling toward the havoc of spreading moral disorder. Homemakers’ disappearance as full-time consensus enforcers left a moral vacuum no one else could fill, contributing a great deal to the sharply increased threat to the social order from the 1960s and 1970s. That teenage drug use and pregnancy were associated with after-school hours was a direct consequence of their lack of supervision. That rates of nonmarital pregnancy in offspring were as low in single parent-grandparent households as in those in which parents were married also gives testimony to the importance of adult supervision.347 As Durkheim says, the more elders are present, the better consensus is enforced.348 Why the Variable Outcomes in the Moral Markets? What is at stake in the moral markets is the ability to prosper or even to survive in life. The greater the education and cultural resources, the greater the ability to navigate the moral markets.

A university education is among other things a boot camp in finding one’s way amid moral diversity. At the other end of the spectrum, the underclass was largely made up of those unable to cope with moral hazards. In U.S. enclaves like small-town northern New Mexico and southeastern Missouri, many lacked the sociocultural resources with which to handle the destructive influences now far more numerous than they had been in 1965. Such areas desperately lacked the coherent, strong community and consensus with which those who were morally shaky might be nudged or pressured into conforming despite their confusion. Of all the effects of the American moral revolution, none was more startling than encountering limits with respect to how much disruption of consensus was possible while society was still able to pass on rational self-control and moral responsibility from generation to generation. One of the great benefits of the rulebound, superego-dominant character is that, once well-socialized, it is capable of making sound moral choices throughout a lifetime without much support from the informal social pressure whose presence was required throughout life to shelter peasants and workers’ traditional, groupbound moralities of social approval and disapproval. But a condition of the superego’s durable strength and the middle class’s with it is sufficient moral solidarity through childhood on the part of the consensus carrying out socialization – the family, school, church, neighborhood, youth program, and especially a combination of them working together. During the critical period of its minority, the rulebound character has at least as much need of moral solidarity as does the groupbound. Under the conditions of the moral marketplace, many fewer were raised than before with the reliable self-control prerequisite to an orderly middle-class life. There have always been problems with properly socializing some in large cities, but during the global era the inability to provide the moral coherence required for middle-class socialization became widespread. In the many jumbled and rebellious areas, adults found it extremely difficult to pass on discipline and moral direction to their children. A central cause of the decline of the middle class was the sociocultural disruption flowing from this inability to reliably pass on its character and morality to younger generations. A fuller grasp of the plight of the contemporary working class requires understanding that most of its woes have occurred because traditional community and consensus collapsed. The working class had been acutely dependent upon and held in suspension by the community and consensus around it.

The working class had been acutely dependent upon and held in suspension by the community and consensus around it. When these supports dissolved, workers either had to develop new inner resources, or they sank toward the underclass. The struggles of the American working class have never been primarily an economic phenomenon. The underclass was largely the roadkill of the wide-open moral markets and the wholesale attacks on moral authority that delivered those markets. Brazenly skeptical gamers having risen to dominate American institutions, those in the middle and working classes, with limited resources for finding their way amid sociocultural disorder, were acutely threatened by the ensuing moral chaos. Many of those who were so threatened in the moral markets responded to their disintegrating worlds by turning to moral reaction and the reaffirmation of tradition. Many among them had the good sense, humility, and faith to seek additional religious grounding. Many had to rally themselves to hold on, not unlike the way in which dangerously drowsy late-night drivers caught between cities open the windows, bounce around behind the wheel, blare the radio, and talk to themselves to stay awake. Sensible Americans of various backgrounds and persuasions were deeply concerned for their society. If the middle class was losing far too many members to disorder, and the working class was in free-fall, it was not unreasonable to be alarmed. Such apprehension was often particularly strong among those with families. If all moral authority were suspect, what standing did parents have vis- $\\cdot \\dot { \\mathbf { a } }$ -vis their children? When a great many self-identified as deviant, how were young people to be brought up? The vehement opposition of many gamers, especially cultural gamers, to the middle-class way of life and of being, inflicted most of the peculiar discomfort of the global-era middle class by comparison with its national-era predecessor. Why Did Morality Decline? Morality declined in the United States and most other advanced liberal societies during the global era, first, because the loss of the consensus and arrival of the moral markets sowed confusion and doubt. A great deal of traditional morality that was regarded as optional and cast aside remained valid, and those who discarded it did so at their own and at society’s peril. The acceptance of great moral diversity and suffering of high moral casualties are two sides of the same coin. Morality declined to the extent to that it did because of the waning of Christianity. The religious markets and assaults on belief increasingly threw the West into moral crisis and dysfunction from the 1960s.

The acceptance of great moral diversity and suffering of high moral casualties are two sides of the same coin. Morality declined to the extent to that it did because of the waning of Christianity. The religious markets and assaults on belief increasingly threw the West into moral crisis and dysfunction from the 1960s. As Peter Berger says, “Traditional religious definitions of reality” suffered “widespread collapse,” leaving uncertainty in their wake.349 It was perturbing for large numbers of those who could no longer take direction or draw solace from religion and had to find sustenance as best they could from a mélange of arid secular beliefs and ethics.350 The waning of Christianity through the era was part of a larger, interrelated matrix including changes of identification, character, law, community, and morality. Class conflict was at the heart of global-era moral decline: The wideopen moral markets left some in joyful freedom with self-fashioned, creative lives; some in cautious apprehension huddled in resisting enclaves; and others in baleful despair stripped of all coherence. In the immense human diversity now encountered daily, what seemed bracing to the sophisticated was often disturbing to the traditional, and what felt comforting to the latter often felt stifling to the sophisticated. The era’s questions of civil liberties entailed deciding how many of the socioculturally independent were going to have the full panorama of the world unveiled exhilaratingly before them, and how many of the dependent were going to wake up with nightmares. The moral politics of the global era was forged of the tension between secular moral independents and religious moral dependents. Where the gamers were morally expansive and confident about human nature, many in the middle and working classes were distressed and fearful.351 The gamers’ ebullition was the middle class’s anguish. The gamers tended to be liberal on social issues and on good terms with multiculturalism, the middle class to be conservative on social issues and resistant to it. The gamers and broad upper-middle class possessed the sociocultural market experience and development with which to feel relatively comfortable with stark moral difference, whether wisely or not was another matter; those with fewer such resources did not. Extending tolerance to activities traditionally condemned as immoral made it more of a challenge for people to know the difference between right and wrong or virtue and vice or how to lead their lives. Abortion was a central battlefield upon which social and moral conservatives and liberals fought pitched battles from the 1960s on primarily because it was enabling for the era’s liberated sex, which was emblematic for moral liberals and anathematic to conservatives. Social liberals were ranting, miffed at the well-intentioned if sometimes narrow middle class whose sturdy morals built this great country.

Social liberals were ranting, miffed at the well-intentioned if sometimes narrow middle class whose sturdy morals built this great country. Lacking insight into and empathy with those traumatized by the moral markets, they brooked nothing short of moral laissez faire. With supremely hollow cant and cruel hardness, they denounced those who were genuinely moral in a rulebound manner and sought respite for themselves, their families, and their society from the moral markets. Much as entrepreneurs are averse to economic hierarchy, those with broad sociocultural experience are averse to sociocultural hierarchy. They cannot stand sociocultural dependence for the same reason those in business cannot stand economic dependence. Gamer intellectuals, writers, and artists were boldly and haughtily libertarian in the sociocultural markets where they were the well-prepared and experienced entrepreneurs, but when it came to the economic markets, they morphed into timid hierarchists whimpering for protection. Bonding dogmatically to the morally expansive and open for all times and places, radical relativists were oblivious to human nature and destructively inconsiderate of the needs of the middle and working classes and of society. This one-sided imposition of the sociocultural world of the gamers again evokes Hegel’s dictum that those new to a higher form of self-consciousness tend first to negate difference and only later to begin reconciling it. The gamers’ higher reflexivity was in the initial phase of new awareness in which those who attained it were enthralled with themselves and imperious toward others. The central moral problem of global-liberal societies was the gamers’ severely limited sense of sociocultural responsibility. On the other hand, while modest middle-class norms and virtues may have enabled the United States to become what it was through the early 1960s and even to a degree into the early 1990s, that morality also required adherence to its norms and virtues by a consensus – at least with regard to how young people were to be socialized – otherwise it failed to reproduce and faltered. That requirement of closedness restricted and inconvenienced growing numbers of others who either did not need rulebound morality; or did, but lacked the good sense or discipline to adopt it. Bourgeois morality has always had difficulty enforcing itself on the classes below it, but that morality became positively fragile when large numbers also outgrew it.

As the middle class had outgrown and chafed at peasant morality centuries earlier, the gamers had now outgrown and were and chafing at middle-class morality. None of this is to say that some successful moral accommodation to multiculturalist and bohemian disorder did not also occur in the middle class. In their way and to a degree, some members of the middle class became market-savvy in today’s free moral surroundings. This tier of the global-era middle class moderately and thoughtfully drew upon pragmatism and good sense informed by moral rules and virtues. This quiet, relatively solid center was neither as sophisticated as the cultural gamers nor as morally threatened as most in the middle and working classes but presented a hesitant, partial analog to the independent, universalistic, often mainline Protestant middle class of national-liberal societies. However, under the difficult circumstances of the moral markets, this middle-class center was unable to reliably pass on its moderation and equilibration to its children. Demoralization also proceeded as far as it did because, thanks to the social ethic and interested lobbies, welfare benefits were widely and abundantly made available, irrespective of desert, such that many of the natural consequences of unwise personal decisions were lifted. Most learn from their own and others’ mistakes if they have to face their consequences. Distinctly fewer learn if people are shielded from them by government intervention and subsidy. Just as today’s Americans in large numbers indulge themselves, they indulge others. To the extent to which human nature is co-dependently enabled, it ignores and pulls away from the healthy fear of moral disorder over time. Such fear, flowing from hard lessons, would have helped a great many. In the broadest horizon, global-liberal demoralization may be said to have been cyclically due. After the period of the Reformation was morally repressive, that of the Enlightenment during the late 17^(th) − 18^(th) centuries was morally expansive in liberal societies like Great Britain and the Netherlands, until 1793, and a generation later in the United States. The 19^(th) century was predominantly repressive until about 1885, and the 20^(th) overwhelmingly expansive again until the late 1960s. Given human nature, whatever the challenges and events of the later 20^(th) century had been, it is unlikely that the excesses of one sort of ebullient moral blowout or another could have long been avoided. Expansion of the welfare and regulatory states did the same. Once the conditions got out of hand – as they did with a vengeance during the late 1960s and early 1970s when the large, unruly U.S. postwar generation came of age – acute moral disorder arose.

Understandably but inauspiciously, the boomers’ parents had wanted to make things easier for them. Peace, prosperity, slackness, and indulgence brought selfishness and the willful ignoring of consequences – for young people themselves, for others, for society, and for the long term. This self-indulgence was strongly related to that from the larger macro co-dependency associated with the excessive tender mindedness and sentimentalism of the social ethic and government expansion. The last general repressive movement in liberal societies began in the late 18^(th) and early 19^(th) centuries352 in reaction to the enormous excesses of the French Revolution and of out-of-control rural migrants entering the burgeoning industrial cities. Time itself prepared the way for the 1960s and 1970s by blurring the memories and distancing the relevance of the horrors of the Jacobins and of terminal exasperation with irresponsible, rural and newly urban labor, occasions for the 19^(th) century moral distress. Time also dated the language of bourgeois morality and rendered the circumstances unpropitious for it. The expansive phase of the global era was in a league of its own, much more radical and much more strongly defended than those of the Enlightenment or national era. No moderate repressive response to moral decline was able to gain majority support, much less a consensus during the period. The gamers dug in, contested it, and successfully defended the open moral conditions they found congenial against middle-class moral reform. The lopsided balance of power enabled moral decline to gather momentum and pose more serious moral threats than any faced in the West since the fall of Rome. Indeed the moral disorder of the global era presented nothing less than the return of the grand moral cycle that was the nemesis of all the great traditional hierarchical societies – the bane of civilization for millennia – largely for which reason Rome fell, the Chinese dynasties collapsed, and a decaying Ottoman Empire blew away in the winds of World War I. Moral decline badly damaged the United States on countless fronts, particularly the political corruption and family disintegration from which disorder was spiraling on all sides. The future of the United States and the world depends upon reversing this moral cycle. Welcome back to the history and human condition many thought to be left behind!

This moral decline presented decadence like that Gaetano Mosca and Vilfredo Pareto wrote about more than a century ago and Ibn Khaldun, Augustine, and Polybius did far longer ago than that.353 Consideration of the intensified moral cycle from 1965 and liberal societies’ unfortunate new position in it brought into relief the astounding secret that early-liberal societies inadvertently discovered – about which the skeptical, anti-free-market, anti-bourgeois scholarship of the global era was in denial and oblivious – that the economic markets confer moral discipline as a most important side effect, discipline that overcomes the grand moral cycle of traditional hierarchical societies.354 Market-induced discipline is what tamed the grand moral cycle into the mild one of modern liberal societies from 1500 to 1965. A key condition of the reappearance of the grand moral cycle since 1965 has been the displacement and hobbling of economic markets by the welfare and regulatory states. The scores of new welfare programs and hundreds of thousands of new regulations arising since – nearly all of them delivered to interested parties by cynical gamers amid PR deceit of the well intentioned but naïve – have brought about a great deal of the current moral disorder. Big government has dried up business investment, shrunk labor force participation, and restricted exposure to the economic markets. A second key condition of its reappearance has been the accession to power of a blinkered gamer elite that would allow society to collapse before relinquishing its predation and imposition. Hierarchical societies have known such unscrupulous ruling classes over the millennia, which exploit all other classes and foil reform until the bitter end, but this was the first time major liberal societies had known them. Why Did Moral Consensus, though Weakened, Remain Relatively Intact in Europe and Japan? Moral consensus remained stronger in most European societies than in the United States during the global era primarily because of Europe’s continuing though diminishing sociocultural homogeneity and delayed multiculturalism. Among other things, these conditions somewhat better enabled European agents of socialization to teach morality. Greater sociocultural coherence, stronger community, and more collectivism combined with more extensive urban life and a richer aesthetic tradition to bring more wholesome character and modeling of lifestyle. Europe’s comparative harmony, in particular its lesser and milder experience of the gamers and underclass and larger and healthier middle classes, were important results. Substance abuse was considerably less serious in most of Europe than in the United States because the former underwent less demoralization overall.

Without the Hunter Thompsons and Howard Sterns they had less need of the Dr. Lauras. On the other hand, increasing numbers of gamers, influence of the media, and sociocultural mixing were pulling Europe in the direction of the United States. Insofar as its economic and political woes permitted, Europe’s comparatively intact moral consensus and more secure middle class underlay an ongoing spirit of celebration, although one that was hushing under attack by its Muslim minorities. The moralities of some of the liberalizing former Soviet peoples on the other hand were ravaged by tyranny and radical modernism, breaking down religion, family, and self-respect, leaving portions of their populations in profound despair. Yet through force of national, communal, familial, and religious tradition, some of the former dependencies were better able to protect themselves morally or more quickly rebuild than others – although their heavy doses of secular ideology largely inoculated them from the morally repressive. For better and worse, the West was relatively well prepared for the moral markets of the last half century by long experience with markets of many kinds. The continuing strength of Japan’s consensus and its hierarchical cast had everything to do with the country’s longstanding and thoroughgoing sociocultural homogeneity and tightly restricted immigration. These conditions preserved strong tradition and enabled policymakers to actively intervene in support of community and consensus, as by protecting small farmers. Japan presents a contrasting approach to that of the West to community, consensus, and morality, one from which the West could learn things of great value. Why the Patterns in the Liberalizing Third World? Rapid economic growth and urbanization along with massive exposure to the international sociocultural markets of the global era brought great development but also wrenching moral dislocation to the liberalizing third world. Consensuses remained stronger in third-world societies than in most first-world countries due to the recency and unevenness of their opening to the world; but the newness of their liberalism interacted with the localism and tribalism still strong in many such countries to aggravate those sources of difference and dissention. Together, these factors resulted in the common third-world pattern of relatively strong consensus at the local or tribal level but weak consensus at the national level. Nevertheless, some third-world societies took the moral markets in stride. India, for one, with its rapid economic growth, educational advances, and comparative openness, was moving overall in the direction of the consensual profile of more developed countries even though relatively strong consensus and lingering provincialism restricted acceptance of the sociocultural markets in many parts of", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634243384_cleaned.txt:191:429027b0bde2", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 1381, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634243384_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634243384", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634243384_cleaned", "chunk_index": 192, "text": "these factors resulted in the common third-world pattern of relatively strong consensus at the local or tribal level but weak consensus at the national level.

India, for one, with its rapid economic growth, educational advances, and comparative openness, was moving overall in the direction of the consensual profile of more developed countries even though relatively strong consensus and lingering provincialism restricted acceptance of the sociocultural markets in many parts of the country. India was among those better prepared for sociocultural liberalization thanks to its highly developed universalism, long familiarity with diversity, and well-rooted democratic traditions. When encountering the moral markets, societies, social classes, and ethnic groups largely fared in accordance with the resources of their traditions, education levels, and economic experience. Why the Patterns in China and the Islamic World? China’s moral consensus loosened significantly in part because the dynamism and upheaval of the economic markets undermined it, particularly by hampering its enforcement. Some of the effect occurred through increased urbanization and education levels that weakened informal social control. Divorce, for example, was on the rise in China in part because of diminished consensual and legal sanction along with diminished disapproval. Married couples once domiciled in extended family compounds became dispersed in apartments of their own, freeing them from considerable family and neighborhood interference. Chinese women’s improved employment opportunities and greater economic independence gave them more options as well. The Deng regime has not sought to coerce compliance with traditional norms and virtues because its political acceptance has not depended upon religious approval in the way that of Muslim rulers has. On the other hand, China’s moral consensus did not liberalize more than it did because of the continuing force of long hierarchical tradition. China possessed considerable universalism but much less familiarity with sociocultural markets than the West, while India was no better than moderately well prepared for them. Yet its totalitarian regime remained able and willing to intercede to curb them as needed. To some extent the Islamic Resurgence, like the far milder and more limited contemporary efflorescence of popular evangelical Protestantism in the United States, has been a reactionary response to the presence of moral markets and their disorienting difference. The sociocultural and historical sources of this reaction have already been discussed, but no small part in the Islamic world’s increased moral repression has also been played by the West’s increasing decadence, which has presented an opening for contempt by Muslims, as opposed to the well-earned but grudging respect more common during the national era. Islam no longer faces a West with cultural power emanating from abundant moral strength; it now faces an aimless and effete West manifesting a dearth of leadership, courage, and consequence. The Islamic Resurgence has been fueled in part by an understandable collective pride in the strengthening of moral seriousness among Muslims.

The Islamic Resurgence has been fueled in part by an understandable collective pride in the strengthening of moral seriousness among Muslims. On the other hand, their severely authoritarian tradition and limited resources for digesting sociocultural disorder have worked against consensus within Muslim societies, as has been evident throughout the Islamic world, in post-Gaddafi Libya, post-Mubarak Egypt, Syria, Iraq, and Pakistan for example. Rejection of the earnest sociocultural working of difference goes back to the foundations of Islam. Islamic societies’ tight moral consensuses ill prepare their members for respecting the rights of others in an interdependent world, beginning with those of women and those of different Muslim faiths. In all but a few unusually progressive and balanced places, Muslims who develop morally do so in resistance to the hierarchalism around them. Islamic men are indulged in their indiscipline by veiling and sequestering women, which does not encourage the independence and development of either. As a charmed Ayatolla Khomeini effectively admitted in his famously ingenuous 1979 interview with Oriana Fallaci, the shari’a (as his regime narrowly interprets it) would collapse in moral markets unprotected by coerced consensus.355 Although its contemporary forms may be overwhelmingly backward, there is nothing inherently wrong with the shari’a; it just needs a great deal of the free criticism and updating that morality has long undergone in other major traditions. T he Central Problem. Global-liberal societies’ acceptance of much of era was appropriate and just. Liberalization of gambling, pornography, and sexuality was predominantly a matter of shedding paternalism and paying respect to others. For, as John Stuart Mill says, “different persons … require different conditions for their spiritual development; and can no more exist healthily in the same moral than all the variety of plants can in the same physical, atmosphere and climate….”356 The inclusion of new moral forms better fulfilling the needs of thoughtful human beings constituted important moral development. This is true despite the fact that in the moral markets it is caveat emptor – participation in the contest is guaranteed but not the choice or following of wise precepts or wholesome models. The moral markets permitted a great deal of Nietzschean ethical experimentation, much of it accompanied by good sense but also much of it not.357 Wide-open moral markets inevitably sustain numerous human casualties. A much more vulnerable middle class, a working class in disarray, fewer and more troubled children, and a growing underclass were key portions of the balance sheet on the moral markets.

A much more vulnerable middle class, a working class in disarray, fewer and more troubled children, and a growing underclass were key portions of the balance sheet on the moral markets. As traditional restrictions were removed out of respect for freedom and the different, people were at once granted rights and made more likely to lose their bearings. As in all markets, creation and destruction are found together in the moral markets. When the middle-class is endlessly lampooned in movies, television, and music lyrics, what are the struggling members of the middle and working classes of all ages who consume this content to make of it? Through savage disparagement, middle-class order, life, and accomplishment may be depicted as hardly worth the effort. Where the bourgeois once sought to jostle peasants into demanding but uplifting middle-class morality, the gamers now seek to prod the bourgeois into unsuitable moral minimalism. The gamers’ intolerant, negativist thrusting forth of their own particularistic ways, when these could not possibly become general models, amounted to terrible class centrism. That the gamers had difficulty recognizing the moral anguish of so many good people and were not taking their well-being and that of their families, communities, and society into consideration is entirely in keeping with the harshness of the gamers’ rudimentary higher reflexivity and awareness. The obligations that come with membership in society do not decrease but increase as one moves up in it. Moral conservatives also often displayed excesses of intolerance and shrillness. Their efforts to roll up the moral markets and put forth morality too rigid for most to accept were examples. Taking cues from their antagonists, they sometimes pushed their program as conflictually as liberal gamers did theirs, but moral conservatives had genuine apprehensions that required urgent attention. They raised the alert about the serious moral disorder that arose in the United States and other advanced global-liberal societies. They posed the question of how such societies were to overcome the modern world’s first large-scale moral decline – much of it, as we have seen, joined at the hip to what was also significant moral advance. The antagonism between the worldviews of the classes must be overcome, as must moral decline. What Is to Be Done? If Americans do not want more and more of our population to be underclass and our country and the world in ruins, we need to do several things simultaneously with respect to morality: First and foremost, we need to let reality teach its stern moral lessons directly and indirectly to a greater degree, allowing the economic markets to selectively punish persons, families, and communities for their moral slackness, foolishness, mistakes, and sometimes evil.

A society that does not allow those who choose the path of nullity to suffer the consequences individually or in groups – one that maintains an indiscriminate welfare state cushioning those who have been harmed, if at all, by their own wrongdoing and vice – postpones, multiplies, and collectivizes the moral destruction. For more than half a century, advanced global-liberal societies have been undergoing moral decline that will not be halted until people are sufficiently chastened to come to their senses. Progressives have absolved irresponsible parents, gamblers, substance abusers, workers, fraudulent benefit claimants, and even violent criminals of responsibility for their actions, ascribing victimhood to them rather than to society. Tenderhearted solicitousness toward the troubled, irrespective of moral desert, allowed that category to expand in all directions, not least among the circles of its deluded admirers. The economic markets, insofar as we permit them to operate, are society’s moral ally and benefactor, helping keep disorder at bay. If the seriously irresponsible are not required to take the natural consequences of their actions – and they do deserve them – then everyone does. Second, we need to teach moral lessons symbolically. Children may be the primary concern, but adults floundering in the moral markets and remiss in their obligations should also be subjected to middle-class moralism on behalf of propriety and order. People have been so browbeaten with radical relativism that they have a difficult time teaching moral principles and virtues. No matter what the devastation, Hamlet-like gamers cannot bring themselves to judge others’ personal morality and chastise it when it is out of line. What previous liberal societies have taught by moral authority was reinforced through personal experience and observation. The moral content so gained may not have been as coherent, but the discipline, prudence, and independence have been there, acquired more in adulthood than in childhood by many. What could be more fitting in a time of turbulent moral markets?! Working together, a free society and bourgeois morality brought about the enormous expansion of the middle class during the 18^(th) and 19^(th) centuries and on through the early 1960s.

Just as it doesn’t matter much what major language young people are brought up in, only that they learn it well, so there needs to be a language of morality rather than a mishmash: Thoughtful parents of various secular and religious persuasions bring up children well while living aware and centered lives in wide-open societies like the United States, United Kingdom, or Brazil by forming loose, partially protected moral-cultural enclaves around coherent traditions while providing resources for criticizing and transcending what is corrosive in the broader society and culture. Such parents establish good family settings and find neighborhoods and schools that stand opposed to what is most harmful in society. They teach children by steps to navigate through much that is amiss. They expose them to homeopathic doses while insulating them from full ones, steadily increasing their freedom as children develop critical facility until strong enough to fend for themselves in the sociocultural markets. Large numbers of thoughtful conservative and liberal parents follow kindred routes with their children while themselves negotiating the full range of available society and culture, naturally shunning what is base in it. The two camps may lean in different directions on where the limits for children and adults should be, but their approaches and personal lives have much in common. Fourth, we have to upgrade education at all levels, for as knowledge and sophistication increase, greater familiarity with and understanding of sociocultural difference are acquired, and people become more astute consumers of the rich human variety presented to them, transforming threats into opportunities. There is no excuse for the United States to be four years behind Finland and South Korea in achievement scores by the end of high school. Academic standards at all levels were deliberately dropped, caving-in to pressure from organized interests, particularly including cynical administrators and unions, often along with, of all people, minorities who acutely need better education. That dropping of standards was frequently carried out, under the false banner of social justice, to spare students and their parents from hard work or miffed feelings. In order for this educational deficit to be turned into excellence, people need boldness, courage, resolve, and confidence in the power of education and freedom. Moving U.S. student achievement scores up to the world’s best could be accomplished within a decade if its citizens were willing to take back their country.

Fifth, the United States and other liberal societies need to pursue consensus-friendly social policy. We need to accept sensible restraints on egregious public conduct and on the sociocultural content to which children are exposed. Nuisance laws such as those against loitering and vagrancy need to be revived and tailored to contemporary conditions. A range of consensus-empowering measures, including the extension of legal authority to landlords, tenants’ organizations, neighborhood associations, school administrations, and communities to enforce standards of public conduct is also needed. Strengthening consensus may include policies like the United Kingdom’s civility laws that empower citizens against public nuisances through the use of anti-social behavior or dispersal orders, among other remedies. The care and maturity in many European countries’ responses to the moral markets have reduced their devastation. People earn the right to highly liberal societies by fashioning pragmatic solutions to the problems arising from them. To the extent to which society were successful with intelligent consensus-building/supporting policies, many of the criticisms of social conservatives would be mooted; to the extent to which it were not, more weight would need to be placed upon their moral prescriptions. As liberals are able to overcome their radical relativism and cease denying morality, and as conservatives are able to overcome their knownothingism and cease trying to impose narrow views beyond their limits, society can get on with the work of renewal. The moral conflict of the global era arose from different characters in different positions vis-à-vis the sociocultural markets. Smooth gamers have their moral needs, steady bourgeois have theirs, and they are not the same. A fundamental question of injustice arises when a society allows itself to become so extremely libertarian that people need a strong university education to survive in the moral markets. The newly educated can be as crass in their way as the newly rich. The gamer chiefs on both liberal and conservative sides need to understand that the different characters and moral stances can be reconciled, with each given due recognition. They need to extend the practice of the tolerance, diversity, and inclusion that they all support with respect to racial and ethnic difference to these important moral differences of class and politics.

The United States entered the global era the greatest nation on earth and one of the greatest in the history of the world but left the era riven by conflict and disintegrating. An astute English observer of the United States said of this country already in the early 1970s that he had never seen a nation pass so quickly from youth to senescence. Perhaps the most dangerous element of how the country was faring by the end of the era was the precarious, partially suspended Pax Americana of its last four years. The country’s national security was being dangerously challenged on multiple sides, most ominously by China. I know of no better succinct assessment of the circumstances at the end of the global era than Henry Kissinger’s of two summers after it ended, that they were “very, very grave.” The conditions responsible for the precariousness of the Pax Americana were no less grave. The United States was coming apart and in grave circumstances by the end of the era, most fundamentally, because of the global-liberal paradigm that had dominated it for 51 years, and in particular the multiculturalism that we have examined, with its subtle but profound change in cast of mind. Rejecting the traditional classical and Christian universalism that had reigned in the West from antiquity, though with lacunae and lapses, multiculturalism had broken society into factious, alienated groups. Nearly all of the sundry domestic wars of the global-era United States were ultimately about whether this society and civilization were to be reorganized on the basis of resentful splintering. Accepting multiculturalism represented a fundamental coming apart that contribute mightily to all of the other comings apart, a progressive national disintegration, that was passed on to Europe after a 25-year lag. 2016 was another of those extraordinary years like 1648 and 1789 incontinental Europe or 1885 and 1965 in the United States when the for the presidency overthrew central tenets of the global liberalism that had reigned as the tacit consensus in the United States since 1965. Trump alone among the more than twenty presidential candidates critiqued the established paradigm, sketched a new one addressing neglected national needs, and vowed to implement it as chief executive.

Trump alone among the more than twenty presidential candidates critiqued the established paradigm, sketched a new one addressing neglected national needs, and vowed to implement it as chief executive. The United States again entered paradigm crisis in which its basic assumptions were in question. The elite of top gamers and upper class of gamers have been relentless in their attacks upon President Trump and his movement, trying at all costs to reverse their gains. American society has been in tension since the 1960s and increasingly so since the 1990s, but it substantially fractured in 2016 as the contest degenerated into a melee in which elite officials and journalists were the chief brawlers. Social ties have been torn apart over politics as only rarely before in the nation’s history. More than four years into the new era, we are again in circumstances resembling those of 1968, early in a paradigm crisis in which nearly everyone is apprehensive. Analyzing the current paradigm conflict must begin with the fundamental problems of global liberalism against which Trump and his movement rose up, those posed by gamers and multiculturalists. The foundations of American society were turned upside down during the late 1960s and early 1970s as the multiculturalist disunity of the global era overthrew the relative domestic unity of the national era that had reigned since the late 19^(th) century. The country lurched from embracing reconciliation to embracing conflict, from an overriding sense of national pride to one of national blame, and from power being predominantly Christian to its being predominantly anti-Christian. The first fundamental problem of the global era was the character of its upper class of gamers, the talented and disciplined but amoral strivers who gamed their way into and through prestigious educations and into impressive executive and professional positions which they then used without restraint to increase their power and wealth. The central problem the gamers posed and continue to pose for American society has been that they feel next to no responsibility toward the larger society and are unconcerned with the effects of their actions upon it. Massive problems were building and festering in all institutions because they disparage their country and eschew leadership. An important manifestation of the gamers’ estrangement is the way in which they badly treat the middle class. In their smug disdain, the gamers, although highly disciplined, cannot bring themselves to respect middle-class lives of simple but sturdy discipline. Their class-centric unwillingness to recognize themselves in the other has led to more than half a century of deprecating the main ladder on which the vulnerable might rise into or secure themselves in the middle class. The gamers rose to power, stormed the bridge, and furloughed the old crew in the global era; but", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634243384_cleaned.txt:199:bb42ef03f94f", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 1389, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634243384_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634243384", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634243384_cleaned", "chunk_index": 200, "text": "badly treat the middle class.

Their class-centric unwillingness to recognize themselves in the other has led to more than half a century of deprecating the main ladder on which the vulnerable might rise into or secure themselves in the middle class. The gamers rose to power, stormed the bridge, and furloughed the old crew in the global era; but virtually none of them took the helm, navigated, watched the radar, or monitored the ship. In their self-centeredness, shortsightedness, indifference, and hubris, the gamers divided the country, jeopardized national security, undermined democracy, battered the family, and shattered morality. The challenge of how to promote leadership and restraint in a talented upper class without a sense of responsibility is as old as civilization. The second fundamental problem of the era was the multiculturalism which shaped the revolution of the late 1960s and early 1970s, the ideology of identity politics, the radical doctrine that people ought to think of their societies as collections of racial, ethnic, gender, lifestyle, and similar groups rather than as national units; and value the aggrieved groups among them rather than their larger societies, indeed value purported social justice for the groups above all other concerns. Multiculturalism holds that the descendants of the subordinate groups of the past ought to blame the descendants of the dominant groups for alleged collective injustice, associate contemporary American society with that injustice, and blame it as well. That fundamental persuasion opposes nation-states but supports supra-national entities like the UN and EU that weaken or displace the nation-state, hence much of their globalism. Multiculturalism values the parts and denounces meaningful societal wholes, as if Americans had nothing in common but membership in antagonistic groups. The gamers’ character and multiculturalists’ doctrine that posed fundamental problems of global liberalism form an interrelated gamer-multiculturalist nexus. The gamers developed multiculturalism and were its strongest proponents, their support for it was one of their strongest claims to legitimacy, and that support was pivotal to the alienated groups’ alliance with them. Multiculturalist disparagement of American society was at the same time the key source of the gamers’ amorality and indifference. With searing rhetoric, gamers fomented multiculturalist division, curried favor with the resulting groups, and then slyly stepped into and exploited the void of engagement and leadership left by the spreading alienation. The global-era American coming apart and senescence were run by and for the gamers. The natural, easy, unassuming Christian genuineness and kindness of the United States, its heritage, and the great majority of its people, national traits that were necessary for this country to become the leader among nations, are why Americans cared and were willing to do their best for decades to improve group relations.

The natural, easy, unassuming Christian genuineness and kindness of the United States, its heritage, and the great majority of its people, national traits that were necessary for this country to become the leader among nations, are why Americans cared and were willing to do their best for decades to improve group relations. Although taken aback by the destructiveness of many manifestations of multiculturalism, they did not grasp for a long time that they were getting with it something very different from their sincere desire to overcome prejudice and discrimination: They were getting an effort to dismantle their society, politics, character, and civilization and fundamentally restructure them along permanently and dangerously divisive and hierarchical lines. The dying gasp of the expiring national-liberal paradigm in its passage of the equal rights provisions of the civil-rights acts attained a balance nobler than any achievement of gamer multiculturalism. It is appalling that those who obsess about one issue to the extent of jeopardizing everything for themselves and for their country should get away with blaming the United States and the West for alleged narrowness. Like so much else of the doctrine, that accusation is both false and all projection. Not surprisingly, black Americans experienced less economic progress overall under multiculturalism than they had during the national era. Who gains power in a society has immense influence upon its members’ identifications and attachments. At the birth of the global era, gamers and multiculturalists drew deeply from intellectual, bohemian, Jewish, black, and generational disaffection and blended it into radical rejection of this society’s foundational Christian reconciliation and relatively harmonious modern secular-Christian synthesis in the previous era’s mainline Protestantism. The global era was instead postmodern and conflictual. As its multiculturalism took hold, the Watts riot occurred, and the civil-rights movement metamorphosed into one expressing anger and demanding governmental and symbolic benefits. As that doctrine picked up momentum and became more alienated, much of the uprising embraced illicit drugs. Multiculturalism’s banishment of meaning played the central role in delivering the boomers’ “me” generation. The precious but fragile idealism of Camelot, still a product of liberal modernity, competed through the 1960s to inspire the young of talent, but multiculturalism dissolved its universalism and hope, leaving it spent by the end of the decade. Gaming and multiculturalism have been intertwined not only with each other but also with moral decline, the third fundamental problem of the global era and the one about which Trump and his movement, like most of their fellow Americans, have so far been in denial.

Much of the gamers and multiculturalists’ alienation was from the United States, the world’s leading country, flagship democracy, and largest economy as well as modern history’s greatest society. Gamers and multiculturalists have wrongly disparaged this exemplary country and its institutions, citizens, tradition, and history for more than half a century now, and they have badly damaged them. The gamers have rejected moral rules and virtues, expressed contempt for Christianity, and dismissed reconciliation. Amid their all-encompassing upper-class presumption and many-sided alienation, practicing civility toward their fellow Americans has been out of the question. With boundless hubris, they have thought, “What could we smart, privileged members of the ‘meritocracy’ – la crème de la crème – possibly owe to our forebears, posterity, or the middle and working classes of this country?” The gamers have been consumed by a will-to-power that they have had the temerity to interpret as universal ordination. Americans no longer trust Congress, the administrative state, journalism, or higher education. Gamers repeatedly attempt to present the problem as one of lack of trust, but institutions are unworthy of trust insofar as they are run by gamers and suffused with multiculturalism. The paradigm crisis in the United States arose from the gamers’ use of multiculturalism’s societal demolition to maximize their power and wealth, against the settled judgment of most Americans that this country required and deserved reconciliation and working together. As growing excess brought gamer multiculturalism toward an inflection point under the Obama administration, the sense grew among levelheaded Americans that the United States was not going to survive unless it fundamentally changed course. Global liberalism was overthrown in 2016 because the threats gamers and multiculturalists posed to the long-term wellbeing of this country and its citizens had become dire. Yet Americans could only do so because an able and determined leader, Donald Trump, founded a movement dedicated to replacing the earlier paradigm and overcoming the fundamental problems to which it led. The many-sided markets (political, social, moral, and cultural as well as economic), the other core element of the global-liberal paradigm along with multiculturalism, performed well overall, posing no problems of comparable magnitude except where influenced by gamers, skewed by multiculturalism, or compromised by moral decline.

They believed that after half a century of neglect, the United States again needed to focus upon what contributes to the general interest, to the common good of the American people, not to what benefits one group or class or another. Unlike a robust majority of citizens, most gamers have lost all comprehension of what this imperative could even mean and, in their insularity, trained obliviousness, and radical relativism, even ridicule it. Average Americans’ discernment of that anomalous incomprehension was crucial to why Trump won the 2016 election and has been able to fundamentally contest gamer multiculturalism. Trump and the Restoration again make society the main reference, not the group, the larger whole the reference, not the part. Doing so maximally benefits the American people, including those in aggrieved groups. Making America great again has been about the return of working together for the long-term wellbeing of this country and its citizens. Trump and the Restoration support those who pursue the best interests of the country as a whole and oppose those who instead elbow and cheat for their individual or group interests. They blame and hold accountable those who disparage, subvert, and exploit America and its middle and working classes. Trump was able to win the presidency in large part because his message of working together for society as a whole was uplifting, hopeful, and resonant with large numbers of Americans who have continued to believe in their country and oppose its naysayers. He was able to win because under his leadership the middle and working classes rose up against the elite and upper-class dividers, rejecting the meanness and destructiveness of their anti-Americanism. Trump also won because he was able to burst the bubble of spurious collective guilt the gamers had socially constructed to sustain the reign of multiculturalism, in keeping with their class and group leanings and what they saw as their interests. He did so by pointing out its contradictions and modeling how its codes might be transgressed, albeit not always with perfect sensitivity, while withstanding nearly unanimous elite and upper-class accusation and denunciation. The reservoir of collective guilt has run dry in a majority of American citizens if not yet a consensus. Many had been there or almost there for a time, and Trump’s leadership took them a decisive additional step in breaking the global-era tacit consensus.

Most Americans no longer accept the upside-down history that prejudicially attributes virtue to the groups and vice to the majority. Long patient with the excesses of multiculturalism, the white majority has seen itself for decades as alone in putting aside group attachment and trying to do what is right for the country as a whole. Sixty percent of white voters supported Trump in the 2016 election, which was by no means the potential upper limit of their support. The Restoration applies the goal of making America great again to the crucial question of immigration by establishing economic, political, social, and cultural compatibility with and assimilability to the United States as the governing criteria for immigration; not proximity to the border, percentage of the world population, having relatives in the country, or drawing random numbers. The Restoration advocates priority to Christian, Jewish, and secular Western backgrounds and to democratic experience and leanings. Its criteria mean no to those who do not accept this country and its basic principles. They mean plusses for English language proficiency, needed entrepreneurialism, education, skills, and economic resources, but no to criminality. They mean yes to compatibility with the labor market but no to most low-skill, low-education immigration that undercuts American workers; which still leaves room for a large, orderly guest-worker program for labor few Americans are willing to do. Its criteria mean citizenship or residency only sparingly extended as a salve to the social conscience and never as a device for building a party’s voter rolls. The Restoration supports instilling basic knowledge and values of this country and reinstating American history and government requirements at all levels of education. The melting pot has been operating all along, but where multiculturalism discouraged and slowed it for more than half a century, the Restoration encourages it. The second principle of the American Restoration, a corollary of the first, posits strengthening and expanding the middle class as essential to making America great again. The sociocultural changes of the global era weighed heavily on the middle class. Under gamer-multiculturalist animus and dysfunction, the middle and working classes of nearly all groups weakened, the underclass expanded, and the great economic progress of two centuries slowed. Trump and the Restoration’s policies aimed at increasing economic growth and employment have been strengthening and expanding the middle class, as would thoroughly reforming education and sharply raising standards at all levels.

Opportunity, aspiration, and hard work toward becoming middle class and securing one’s place in it offer those who are struggling the chance to progress and flourish. The gamers need to be brought front and center into analysis of how the middle class has fared since 1965, for their failures of leadership and responsibility lie behind most of its woes. The gamers’ ability and skills can be extremely valuable to society, but their character and orientation have been disastrous. An upper class may have its great rewards, within reason, but in return it must provide leadership and be responsible – that is a law.358 Ayn Rand makes a lively sophomore argument but passes neither empirical nor moral muster. A necessary condition of reforming the gamers and righting the upper class’s relationship with the country is freeing liberal-arts education of gamer-multiculturalist anti-American, anti-Christian, and anti-Western venom. The academe that ensconced itself early in the global era excoriated and banished the classics of Western Civilization – for their elitism no less, a gem of gamer-multiculturalist wisdom. Complex societies cannot but have upper classes; the issue is whether those upper classes are to be moral and responsible. For if they are to be, we had better immerse the young of talent in the civilizational foundations of morality and responsibility. As the West forgets its classical humanism and abandons the Christianity well integrated with it, it is grounded upon little but sand. Without the classics, humanities, religion, and more than rare examples of a worthy upper class to inspire and sublimate the super-achievers, in our time gamers, things become a lot like Lord of the Flies. 359 When sections of the middle class get on steroids, take hardball competition and striving to vicious extremes, and become amoral upper classes – which has happened repeatedly in history – only upper classes of distinction and morality are capable of overcoming them while protecting that which they neglect and those whom they mistreat. Well-balanced, civilized, caring human beings able to perceive the unity in diversity and act in the interests of the whole are always needed to temper and restrain the ruthless.

Trump and the Restoration depart dramatically from global liberalism with respect to its multiculturalism and treatment of the middle class but not with respect to its other policies. They have sought to strengthen the Pax Americana by building up the military; dealing effectively with China, North Korea, Russia, and Iran; and persuading unserious, free-riding, sometimes passive-aggressive allies to pull their share of the load. Trump and the Restoration support the many-sided markets, with relatively minor qualifications, as have the previous paradigms of liberal modernity. Global capitalism continues, but mercantilist cheating on the rules of international trade is no longer accepted. Trump and the Restoration’s economic policies have brought needed economic reform and growth. All institutional arrangements are in question in the current paradigm crisis as they have been in previous ones. To the extent to which the Restoration is successful, important fundamentals will change markedly after being tested but most will change only by degree. Trump and the Restoration’s efforts to overcome multiculturalism, reorient society toward the common good, and strengthen the middle class have been their key reversals of global-liberal policy. The uprising of the middle and working classes has largely been their reaction to the devastation of 51 years of global liberalism, to the sense that this country was approaching a point of no return. By early 2016 we were headed toward major woes in all institutional areas and toward ruin in some of them. One of many examples was an opioid crisis that was wreaking terrible damage with hardly anyone in the elite or upper class seeming to care. Movements of restoration analogous to that in the United States are under way in Europe, but only those in Hungary and Poland have yet dethroned multiculturalism although others in the United Kingdom, Denmark, France, Italy, Austria, Slovakia, and Croatia are getting close. As in the United States, the inability of gamers and multiculturalists to consider national needs other than those to funnel resources to and indulge themselves lies behind the uprisings. Restorations are necessary when great countries have suffered terrible devastation. An example was the restoration of ancient Rome under Diocletian and Constantine during the late 3^(rd) and early 4^(th) centuries in recovering from the disasters between 180 and 284 AD. That restoration won Rome nearly two hundred years of additional vibrancy in the West and 1200 years in the East after its society had been on the rocks.

The Anatomy of Resistance: Top Gamers and the DPASM he central opposition to Trump and the Restoration is the left-lean-Ting, top-gamer elite of the United States in lockstep with the consolidating Democratic Party-Administrative State Monopoly complex (DPASM). Considered narrowly, the monopoly complex comprises the crony-capitalist monopolistic and oligopolistic corporate entities hovering about the government; but considered broadly, the DPASM comprises a single, immense monopoly complex. It represents all that is large and monopolistic seeking to control and exploit all that is small and independent; which is to say, it represents government at all levels remote from the people, large corporations and unions in various stages of consolidation, and aligned NGOs of many descriptions. Most large organizations are on board, most billionaires are on board, large tech companies are on board, and the alienated groups are on board. The DPASM is isomorphic with the large special interests that Trump and the Restoration anathematize. As the gamers were the dominant class of the global era, the top gamers are making a determined bid to become the dominant class of the new era. The elite top 1 percent of gamers, the top gamers who run and staff the DPASM at high levels, are buttressed by large majorities of other gamers and the upper-middle class, even as the top gamers are now increasingly rising above them. Scary smart and having median net worths in the tens of millions, the top gamers are exceedingly cunning, calculating every word and gesture to advance their interests. Around the top gamers, nothing is as it appears: Their actions speak to who they are and what they are about but never what they say, and even their actions do so extremely subtly. The top gamers are now pulling away from other gamers to form their own distinct upper-upper class and becoming aware of themselves as such. They have begun congealing as a distinct class in large part by capitalizing upon ordinary gamers’ withdrawal from their society and obsequiousness before the special interests. The top gamers pose a more imminently dangerous problem to the country than have the gamers.

The top gamers pose a more imminently dangerous problem to the country than have the gamers. Top gamers manifest most of the traits of the ordinary gamers from whom they have emerged, only more extremely. Where the gamers are single-mindedly ambitious in their drives to power, the top gamers are ambitious to totalistic extremes. Where relatively few gamers stand out as completely unscrupulous, most top gamers regularly manipulate, deceive, and betray. Their careers are littered with figurative and, where the rule of law is weak, real corpses. Unscrupulous top gaming has become pervasive in and around American politics, government, journalism, the media and academia. An important section of the elite is drawn from cultural gamers the vast majority of whom also line up with the DPASM. They form the church to the DPASM’s state, justifying and legitimizing it, running interference for it, and sharing in the spoils. The DPASM rules, as Michael Anton says, with the full support of the Megaphone, the “progressive” corporate left media-journalism-academy-arts complex.360 The top gamers reward the Megaphone’s loyal hacks with employment, resources, access, and recognition. The free press was beginning to gingerly transform itself into a central part of the Megaphone during the 1980s and 1990s, selectively doing so during the next decade and a half, and furiously completed the process in 2016 and 2017. The Megaphone abets the DPASM’s benumbing of naïve idealists, buying off of low-income voters, and fanning of multiculturalist flames while attacking their critics with oppo research, selective coverage, fake news, trash-talk, libel, character assassination, and radical relativist smokescreen.361 The Megaphone is the propaganda arm of the DPASM, turning fact into advantageous assertion, statistics into sophistry, critical inquiry into inquisition, universities into madrassas, and history into PR doled out to client groups. It wages culture wars to stifle political and intellectual opposition to itself, the monopoly complex, and their supporters. It wields vast power to define or redefine what it wants, as in the way in which it arbitrarily switched the color designations of progressive and conservative states without meaningful opposition, shedding the well-deserved but symbolically disadvantageous red and appropriating the symbolically desirable blue.

With almost all of its resources commandeered by the top gamers and DPASM, propaganda is flourishing, but journalism is barely hanging on in America. The stage set by its locked-in resentful groups, the Democratic Party has been drawing a supermajority of top gamers entering or approaching politics since the 1990s, by primarily representing them and winking at and facilitating their plundering. As their power and wealth have grown, the operators have cloaked their predation with unctuous, hypocritical appeals about inequality. “Trust the government to save the poor and victimized,” the top gamers say to the naïve and alienated. “Come to my shell game,” they whisper among themselves as they further monopolize the economy, increase inequality with surreptitious government assistance, and set up zombie-staffed clones of the Post Office and DMV. The top gamers support “redistribution” to acquire additional levers of power and privilege, big government to advance their monopoly interests, and open borders to import Democratic voters and cheap labor. The top gamers’ multiculturalism may have an important aspect of shared religion, but it is to them above all a means to divide and conquer. Under their control, the Democratic Party has become a coalition of fraudsters, the naïve, and the resentful. Although nominally opposing the developing DPASM and Megaphone, the fewer top gamers of the Republican Party establishment had substantially failed to oppose them until Trump arrived. They had gained electoral advantage from the fact that their ideas sometimes reflected common sense and concern for the country, but diffidently accepting the assumptions of gamer multiculturalism, those junior partners in corruption dithered, hesitated to play hardball, and lost most of the administrative, legislative, and judicial contests if not the electoral ones. Under Trump’s leadership, the Republican Party has somewhat come around to stand up against the DPASM but not with much spirit. The younger Republican gamers taking up the banners of Trump and the Restoration may typically bring less sophistication to the table than their Democratic opponents, but many more of them both grasp and care about the country’s opportunities and problems. As Trump overcame the Resistance attacks upon him, open support for establishment Republicans and Never Trumpers collapsed, but more than a little sandbagging has continued, as in Mitch McConnell and the Senate Republicans’ gratuitous backlog in confirming Trump’s administrative appointments and remarkable lack of outrage and action regarding DPASM sedition and corruption. Granted, they have done an excellent job on court appointments. The administrative state has been another core element of the developing DPASM.

Ignoring their oaths of office, federal bureaucrats, especially top ones, have come to feel that it is now theirs to rule, not to faithfully execute the laws of the United States as enacted by Congress and directed by the President. Having increasingly felt superior to their fellow citizens and above the law, they were attempting to transform themselves from civil servants into commissars under Obama’s coaching and have been intensely doing so since 2016, if more cautiously. Paid as well as sworn to defend the constitution, intelligence agents have instead been using their spycraft and surveillance for political purposes. Chuck Schumer speaks gleefully of their power, “Let me tell you: You take on the intelligence community – they have six ways from Sunday of getting back at you.”363 Sharing the nihilism and hubris of other top gamers, administrative-state elites have played teamwork with Democratic administrations and sabotaged Republican ones, as have hundreds of thousands of its run-of-the-mill gamers. Rogue political behavior has become widespread and blatant in the federal bureaucracy and that of the larger states, especially blue ones, as the top gamers and DPASM have been attempting to suppress democratic opposition. When the DPASM gathers in all communication, illegally weaponizes leaking, and monopolizes the media, opposing it becomes exceedingly difficult. The enormous size, power, and entrenchment of the administrative state have added greatly to its corruption, as has the estrangement of its gamers from the American people and their institutions and values. Large corporations are also a core part of the DPASM. They leaned toward the Republican Party for its support of the free markets through most of the global era as they had during the national era, but the larger and more monopolistic of them began throwing in with the Democratic Party later in the global era, a trend that accelerated as Democratic politicians were virtually hanging out neon for-sale signs, and establishment Republican ones were not far behind. The top executives of monopolistic and oligopolistic companies were concluding that a lot more money was to be made in partnering with corrupt officials than from enduring the rigors of free-market competition. Their money bought the support of the officials, who in return gave the companies and their wealthy owners tax breaks and barriers to entry strengthening their monopolistic positions. Big tech played its role on the team also by using its formidable control and censorship to throw huge assistance to the Democratic Party. Top executives wagered that government had become large and corrupt enough and democratic oversight tenuous enough that they could get away with it.

Top executives wagered that government had become large and corrupt enough and democratic oversight tenuous enough that they could get away with it. The bit players and extras among the gamers and upper-middle class have also been part of the story if mostly oblivious to the larger drama within which they have been acting. The naïve may have good hearts and feel sincerely democratic, may be concerned for the country and its middle and working classes, and may have apprehensions about the top gamers, but they have failed to notice that the elites, including those owning the media and suppressing the news, have crept over into their party. The naive mostly still believe in much of what they have long believed in, but the Megaphone has too stirred them up to notice that their party has done a 180 and has not for decades been what they thought it was, and has too incited them to notice that they who were once proudly open and tolerant have become personally authoritarian. Nor have they noticed that theirs has become the party of Big Brother, everywhere displaying parallels with 1984. Notice how Big Brother is watching with police and computer cameras, listening with transgender aliases like Siri and Alexa, and recording every click, keystroke, and GPS location. Notice the ubiquitous doublethink in the news and commentary, the omnipresence of the Thought Police, and the imputed “thought-crimes” they watchfully punish. Notice the sweeping rewriting of history. Notice the “Big Lies” with which top gamers smirkingly play along. None of them believe that discrimination is a major factor in the tribulations of black Americans. None of them care about the large numbers of black lives lost to violent crime arising from woke attacks restricting the police. None of them believe the Russia collusion story they have pushed. Notice that the top gamers’ philosophy remains as Orwell described more than 70 years ago: “Not merely the validity of experience, but the very existence of external reality was tacitly denied by their philosophy. The heresy of heresies was common sense.”363 Big Brother’s representative O’Brien tells the protagonist Winston, “The more the Party is powerful, the less it will be tolerant; the weaker the opposition, the tighter the despotism.”364 At the most profound level, all of their nonsense, which is to say, all of their non-technical cultural content and all of postmodernism, is meant to confuse and control you.

It is all sparring and gaming intended to separate people into the few controllers and the many controlled. Truly dangerous is not any single element of the DPASM but that the top-gamer elites who operate all of its elements have come together into a tight, exclusive consensus and have been marching together in close formation for the first time in American history, other than briefly under the extremely different circumstances of World War II. Also truly dangerous is what they are marching for and toward. The Resistance has been about elites’ unrestrained pursuit of power multiculturalist one they dispense as they do junk food, opioid medications, violent video games, and unsound mortgages – is self-seeking but now with a vengeance; which is to say, feverishly and by every means possible, flouting morality, the rule of law, and constitutional limits. The top gamers cloak themselves with inflammatory appeals to multiculturalism, effusive promises of government benefits, and mawkish deception of the naïve as they scheme with fellow operators on behalf of their interests. American national security, free markets, democracy, way of life, culture, education, beliefs, and values are all for sale by the top gamers, who have insinuated themselves as brokers auctioning it all away. Their slash-andburn MO is as destructive to the country as their looting and pillaging. The top gamers and DPASM’s shrouded new paradigm alternative for the country is full-bore, pedal to the metal on the road toward elite monopolistic control of power and wealth, which is the road toward authoritarianism and totalitarianism, although few of them are looking even that now potentially short distance ahead. Authoritarian by inner and outer experience, the top gamers are hard, hard men and a few hard women long used to commanding themselves and others mercilessly. They are hell-bent upon and have no compunction about dictating to their fellow Americans and suppressing any who get in the way. They have been abandoning democracy not by deliberate choice in the manner for which the French existentialists mournfully pleaded through the mid- 20^(th) century but as the unthinking, cumulative consequence of their habitual transgressions of reason and restraint in pursuit of what they take to be their interests. They represent Plato’s Thrasymachus again, scoffing in the Republic at the very notion of morality.365 Their will to power has been of a piece with the Clintons’ brazen pay-to-play corruption, their moving entourage-cum-cabal, Obama’s devious partial remaking of federal agencies into instruments of political repression, his systematic sabotage of his successor’s presidency, intelligence agencies’ politicizations, and the mutation of", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634243384_cleaned.txt:212:cefbe4f24105", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 1402, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634243384_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634243384", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634243384_cleaned", "chunk_index": 213, "text": "unthinking, cumulative consequence of their habitual transgressions of reason and restraint in pursuit of what they take to be their interests.

Much more devoutly than ordinary gamers, top gamers worship at the altar of Nothing, the Latin nihil. Essential checks and balances had been dissolving since the early 1970s, but American democracy began nearing crisis as President Obama politicized and weaponized the administrative state and larger DPASM for war to suppress the loyal opposition. A key part of the run-up to the Resistance was the way in which he coopted federal agencies to have his way outside the law for political purposes. He invited Commissioner of the IRS Lois Lerner to the White House an astounding 47 times, systematically politicizing the agency to audit and suppress hundreds if not thousands of conservative organizations all over the country, threatening and often imposing dire tax penalties, killing the Tea Party, and badly disrupting Republican campaign activities. His politicized Small Business Administration harassed and punished Republican donors in a similar manner. Among many examples, the agency arbitrarily confiscated the venerable Gibson Guitar’s valuable supply of exotic woods, nearly bankrupting it. Its offense was having been a small business whose owner supported the opposition. Obama may well have won reelection through his widespread use of the administrative state to suppress the Republican Party. One heard virtually none of this from the Megaphone. Silenzio! The crisis of democracy was fully upon us when Donald Trump dared to stand up to and frontally challenge the top gamers, DPASM, and Megaphone in becoming a serious contender for the presidency in early 2016. The effort by Trump and the Restoration to democratically and lawfully overcome top-gamer predation and machinations, veiled by a multiculturalism that almost unanimous elite and upper-upper class opinion took to be foundational after its 51-year roll, is what “triggered” the Resistance. Under Obama’s direction, administrative state top gamers, who had been spoiling for a fight and playing fast and freely with the law, struck against Trump and his campaign, tapping phones and sending in spies. In November of that year, on the verge of de facto hierarchical rule under the Clintons; Trump, the Restoration, and American voters shunted them off the road. Incensed to find themselves defeated, the top gamers quickly marshaled their forces, resolved to destroy Trump and key associates without procedural restraint, and began goose-stepping to achieve that purpose.

Incensed to find themselves defeated, the top gamers quickly marshaled their forces, resolved to destroy Trump and key associates without procedural restraint, and began goose-stepping to achieve that purpose. The largest swarms of elite attacks, with knowing falsehood, first accused him of colluding with Russia. No sooner had those charges been demonstrated to be patently false than the deep state (i.e., the law enforcement and intelligence sections of the administrative state) contrived another set of bogus charges regarding Ukraine while elites attacked any who mentioned the Clintons’ crimes or Bidens’ corruption. Having long gotten away with increasingly arbitrary action, they disrespected the election and constitution, doubled down, and sought to have their way above the law. Trump’s elite opponents have tasted blood in their unrelenting attacks on his candidacy, presidency, family, and very being. A key part of the picture lies in understanding how such extremely intelligent and rational attorneys as James Comey, Peter Strzok, Andrew McCabe, Lisa Page, and their analogs in the Department of Justice could have deliberately chosen to commit their numerous felony crimes against our democratically elected president and his top associates. The answer is that a whole new elite sociocultural matrix was rapidly jelling in and around the DPASM as the conditions of democracy were slipping away and those of authoritarianism were going into place. They all took for granted in their Washington bubble that Hillary Clinton was a done deal. They all knew that, given the circumstances, the Clintons meant the effective end of American democracy. Ambitious to rise under the new administration and regime, they jumped the gun to further their political stock. As a backup, they all knew that, with many hundreds of billions in negative advertising and PR from all sources against Trump and the Restoration, their fellow top gamers had created so much agitation in naïve and resentful Democrats, so much division and polarization that progressives could no longer be convicted of any crime against the opposition by a unanimous jury verdict. Even that was only in the unlikely event that elite prosecutors would bring charges against them in the first place and elite judges would allow proceedings to go forward. They all took out professional liability insurance with which to pay legal expenses. Moreover, they were aware that with the Megaphone having a more than 90 percent monopoly on the news, giving unqualified, blanket propaganda support to elites and the DPASM and with tech giants controlling nearly 100 percent of social media, neither the rule of law nor democracy was any longer sustainable without fundamental restoration.

Democracy crumbles when unified billionaires control the entire public square within which political discussion and organization occur. Little public space is left within which freedom of speech and freedom of organization are possible. We Americans have allowed the top gamers and DPASM to become so powerful that anyone who threatens to significantly slow the traffic on their road to authoritarian rule and the serfdom of the American people becomes the object of extreme vituperation, false accusation, spying, and arbitrary legal action with punishing financial consequences. President Trump and the Restoration have opposed elites’ tyrannical rule, and they have been ruthlessly attacked for doing so. American politics has become so brutal and treacherous at the hands of the incipient tyrants and henchmen that only an extremely small subset of otherwise highly qualified potential opposition leaders has the toughness and courage to withstand it. The top gamers and DPASM have turned American politics into a commodity exchange defended by blood sport. Who else could have taken what Trump has as president? Any Republican or independent contender for the presidency, other than an establishment cipher whom elites already own, will be taking escalating versions of the broadside fusillades and foul play they have directed at Trump. Gamers have long been attempting to tighten their political grip by fueling leftist hysteria, evoking the incendiary enragés of the French Revolution. As they were coming into their own in the 1980s and pulling back into upper-class enclaves especially numerous on the two coasts, the hysteria began being directed against Reagan. I first paid attention to it when Ted Kennedy began whipping up the hysteria as it was building during the 1990s. Gamers were beginning to know hardly anyone who was not upper class and to hear hardly anything that was not from the corporate left media. Their increasing insularity and waxing hubris brought fierce intolerance of any diversity that was not politically beholden to them. The insularity and intolerance have been accentuated in youth who have grown up under helicopter parenting. The worsening myopia of their political correctness is an important manifestation of the constricting circle. They demand conformity with an ever-encroaching multiculturalism while fatuously virtue signaling each other. They impute a microaggression if someone gestures, speaks, writes, or votes in a manner of which they disapprove. Unseen is the macroaggression of their expanding attempts to bully and dictate to their fellow citizens, in the fraudulent names of inclusion, diversity, and tolerance no less.

Unseen is the macroaggression of their expanding attempts to bully and dictate to their fellow citizens, in the fraudulent names of inclusion, diversity, and tolerance no less. The hysteria sharply intensified in 2016 as the top gamers, DPASM, and Megaphone began increasingly orchestrating it. Their assaults upon Trump and the Restoration have been calculated, higher-stakes versions of the piranha fests by self-appointed political correctness police upon insufficiently conformist speakers, administrators, professors, and students at Yale, Claremont, Middlebury, Berkeley, Evergreen State, and other universities and colleges. The “moral police,” the ANTIFA and BLM brownshirts who often accompany them, and those who permit their riots and hate crimes call themselves progressive, but progress toward what ends could that represent? Most among the long-harassed and increasingly surly middle and working classes pay little or no attention to such attacks, but nor has their elected president been fully able to govern amid the ceaseless libels, conspiracies, and sabotage. The top gamer/DPASM PR barrages and star-chamber legal assaults constitute mobilization for a rebound – resistance, as in the French resistance against the Nazi occupation, they call it in accent-free 1984-speak. At a receding apex of the congealing DPASM during and just after the campaign lay the Clintons, fresh from almost half a century of sprawling political corruption, culminating in their hugely lucrative fake charity. As the Clinton campaign rigged the Democratic nomination against Bernie Sanders, the otherwise near-certain party nominee, it sought Obama’s help in first attempting to derail the Trump campaign and then to nullify the election. The libelous Russia conspiracy subterfuge that greatly disrupted the Trump campaign and presidency was Clinton-sponsored oppo fiction concocted and disseminated by Fusion Research and its MI6 alumnus-for-hire Christopher Steele, with Obama administration, CIA, FBI, NSA, and as it turns out, FRS teamwork.366 Obama has been and remains at a central apex of the developing DPASM, first as president and then behind the scenes. He and top associates conspired to determine the election outcome; when that was unsuccessful, to remove the new president from office; and when that failed, to mangle his presidency. Obama utilized the deep state, with CIA Director John Brennan acting as a chief agent, to frame Trump. The Megaphone went into high gear, pulling out all the stops to crank up the fake news hysteria machine with ceaseless false and exaggerated accusations against the president. Immediately after Peter Thiel dared to come out in active support of Trump at the 2016 Republican National Convention, the Obama Labor Department landed hard upon one of his companies.

The retribution operated as it had with Gibson Guitar and as it routinely does in Putin’s Russia. In deploying a wide range of dirty trick assets against Trump and the Restoration, Obama, the Clintons, their top associates, the administrative state, and their billionaire monopolist backers ramped Saul Alinsky up to Vladimir Putin. Free institutions were menaced, compromised, and weakened as the Democratic Party transformed itself into a base camp for subverting American democracy, like the German Nazi Party did during the Weimar years and as the Communist parties of France and Italy attempted to do during the postwar decades. The extra-legal assaults against the elected president were begun not in the straightforward manner of Fort Sumter but in the complex, deceptive, asymmetric manner of the top gamers, a domestic and international manner with which Putin has acquainted the world. The top gamers shamelessly brawl, feint, throw tantrums, spout bald-faced lies, and act with lightening quickness in ways surprisingly and deceptively intended to further their interests. The Resistance’s Fort Sumter moment was its launching of multiple overlapping illegal conspiracies to first control and then to reverse the outcome of the 2016 presidential election. CIA and FBI fingerprints were all over Nixon’s removal from office. Trump too has squarely take on the administrative state, and again CIA and FBI fingerprints have been all over the serial attempts at his removal. Closely observing comparable travesties in the early 20^(th) century, Hayek warned that the government’s coercive control apparatus is its aspect most dangerous to democracy.367 Watching multiple FBI chiefs sit in judgment of a newly elected President of the United States and maul his first term in office as part of a larger conspiracy that included the outgoing administration, scores of Department of Justice officials, and multiple intelligence heads while the Megaphone cheered them on was an astonishing spectacle to any supporter of democracy. They spied upon Trump and his campaign, framed them, withheld evidence, destroyed evidence, perjured themselves, and lied to Congress while overseeing the cover-up of the Clintons’ high crimes. If the top-gamer impresarios of those and similar outrages had been able to destroy Trump’s presidency, they would have raked in the short-term spoils, heedless of the fact that in doing so they would have terminally embittered the white middle and working classes of this country and severely damaged its democracy and national security, with dire and far-reaching consequences for themselves and their fellow Americans.

The conditions of democracy have been receding in the United States because, wielding multiculturalism as a wrecking ball, the top gamers have been able to accumulate and exercise immense power and resources while they and ordinary gamers have been steadily undermining the middle class and rendering it politically, socially, and culturally ineffectual. Their great power, wealth, and ability have in turn fed the top gamers’ hubris, emboldened them, and dissolved their tolerance and restraint. Controlling the administrative state, they cover for and fail to enforce the law against each other and sabotage lawful directives from conservative officials. Elites’ substantial locks on the media and education, exposure to little but their own propaganda, isolation in homogeneous neighborhoods and metropolitan areas, and formation of overlapping fraternities of character and culture aggravated their tension with the rest of society until paradigm conflict exploded in 2016. The conditions of democracy have been receding because after half a century of obsessing upon difference under gamer multiculturalism – half a century of gratuitous alienation, blame, and conflictualism – the sense of and concern for their country have largely dissolved at the top of American society. Such are the workings and wages of top-down moral decline, the third fundamental problem carried over from the global era, accompanying and aggravating gaming and multiculturalism. Who are these cruel, soulless Phi Beta Kappas and Ivy Leaguers without breadth, history, heart, or morality? Not only are American journalists now acting more like their Soviet counterparts of half a century ago than like the American journalists of the past, but American civil servants are acting more like Soviet apparatchiki than like their predecessors, American billionaires are acting more like Russian oligarchs than like the very wealthy of the mid-century, and American intelligence officials are acting more like KGB than like most of their predecessors. How could anyone ever again utter the word “merit” without irony after watching this elite plot, prey, deceive, ransack, and stonewall? Do not forget for a moment that the FRS successor to the KGB now rules Russia. In addition to the fundamental problems carried over from the global era, the new era has added its own with American elites’ push toward hierarchical rule, with grave assaults upon our democracy and its elected officials and citizens in the exercise of their constitutional rights and duties.

Several tens of thousands of elite Americans attended by a few million gamers have quietly reached the conclusion on some level that it is right and just that they rule dictatorially over 330 million of their fellow citizens. The top gamers’ intransigent doubling down, abandoning of the rule of law, and embracing of Leninist methods have represented the metastasizing and spread of the problems of the global era. Accordingly, the third basic principle of the Restoration has become that as a high priority we must restore and strengthen the U.S. constitution and democracy against the top gamers’ drive toward authoritarianism. If we value our freedom, our property, and our lives, we must make certain that the Resistance is soundly defeated and transformed into the blowout of a bankrupt gamer multiculturalism – sending progressives back to their drawing boards and the once and hopefully future liberal foundations they have forsaken. That is going to be a decades-long struggle without respite, for the top gamers and DPASM are pursuing their authoritarian quest on all fronts, at every opportunity, and with all of their resources engaged. As if all of this were not sufficiently alarming, those resources are just now beginning to be supercharged by the industrial revolution of the new era, at the absolute center of which is AI. Repudiating the wisdom and courage of the past that have bequeathed to us supple, hard-won democratic mechanisms and traditions enabling difficult oppositions to be peacefully reconciled, Democratic Party insiders’ paradigm alternative to Trump’s Restoration has in effect become hierarchical rule by the top gamers and DPASM. Its unstated party platform poses a haunting shadow regime for the United States, the first such regime the United States has faced since Appomattox and only the second in its history. The towering domestic issue before us now and for the next few decades is whether this country ought to remain a democracy or ought to adopt authoritarianism. If you do not know that already, you had better come out of your slumber. In sixty years, our elites have sunk from the best and the brightest to the worst and the brightest. The American people know what they must do about their unwanted new predicament: They must stand up for themselves and what they hold dear after having allowed themselves to be bludgeoned and trampled upon by contemptuous elites and gamers for 55 years.

They can do so, but first they must wake up, throw off the yoke of the Megaphone in all of its manifestations, and organize. President Trump with his bold insights, outsized charisma, earnest pa-triotism, and empathy with mainstream America has played the lead role in the paradigm conflict embroiling the United States. His complex character is intertwined with his experience as an entrepreneur and entertainer of genius and his having grown up, come of age, and flourished in New York City, one of the nation’s epicenters of gamers and multiculturalists. Like Andrew Jackson, he is an executive force Americans have but rarely witnessed in the White House. Trump honed his formidable social and communication skills as a reality TV host wielding verbal and behavioral kung fu. How else would one attack the smooth, treacherous top gamers with their ratcheting control of the country? He utilizes those skills when he wields the truth in blunt, courageous ways to expose top gamer/DPASM misconduct. Who else among presidential contenders since Reagan has spoken authentically to the middle and working classes? Who else has worked with anywhere near Trump’s effectiveness on the country’s and their behalf? While faux-delicate top gamers and tens of millions they influence have respectively worked themselves and allowed themselves to be worked into states in which they find the middle- and working-class vernacular, manners, and morality startling and offensive, Trump is a most unusual top gamer who grew up absorbing the language of those classes in rebellious disgust with his fellow elites, to the subsequent delight of his many supporters but the outrage of gamers. In a similar manner the Federalist elites scorned and conspired against Jackson, the blunt and courageous bearer of an earlier middle-class paradigm. Trump possesses a comprehensive vision of where the country must go if it is to be saved from depredation, authoritarianism, and ruin. As Marini says, Trump has been attempting to reach out to all citizens over and above the factious groups. He has appealed “to the rule of law and attacked bureaucratic rule as the rule of privilege and patronage….” ^(𝔫368)He may use contention and he must, but he reconciles what gamers and multiculturalists have compulsively divided since the 1960s: He keeps the well-being of the larger society in mind and sees worth in all classes and groups of Americans.

Refocusing upon the wellbeing of the whole, reemphasizing commonality, overcoming conflict, and strengthening and expanding the middle class represent extremely important reconciliation that restores and strengthens America. Acting with consequence internationally, obtaining cooperation from allies and trading partners, reducing and redirecting social programs, cutting and redirecting regulations, and reforming taxation, if less dramatic, also do. If you were there fifty-plus years ago but said of Jerry Rubin and Abbie Hoffman that their manners were just dreadful, my goodness; you were sleepwalking through 1960s – you were out of it! The same goes for reading Trump today. Many critics regard performance art to be the leading genre of contemporary art. Those who do not actually get what Trump is doing had better engage in extensive preparation before visiting the Whitney Museum. The meaning of conservatism and composition of conservative parties have been changing before our eyes because the threats to Western societies, Western Civilization, the world, and freedom have been changing, as have the ways in which those threats might best be overcome, all rapidly since 2016. The gamers have been unremittingly contentious from the outset toward any who disagree with them, turning democratic conversation into the brutal combat of identity politics. Republican presidents and candidates from the late 1960s on, even Reagan, dared not contest them on ideological basics until 2016.369 Elites and gamers have finally met in Trump a leader able and willing to do high-stakes battle with them. The relationship between the camps is no longer combative one way and capitulatory the other; it is combative both ways. Once the gamers were fundamentally challenged, once they for the first time met head-on opposition and were defeated by it in battle, they hyperventilated for a moment and then went apoplectic – Trump’s unthinkable effrontery in failing to honor their entitlement, returning fire against their continuing barrages, and labeling their multiculturalist and other poisons what they are! Most middle- and working-class Americans grasp what legions of naïve idealists do not, that an extremely valuable leader may have a different style and manner, that in the largest view the foibles of an Admiral Nelson or a Jackson, Patton, Kennedy, or Trump pale toward insignificance when weighed against the extraordinary importance of their public service – and that today’s smart, polished, credentialed, and superficially correct elites are routinely void of concern for their fellow citizens and coldly act in ways that, if not overcome, will destroy their societies.

Middle- and working-class Americans have not only retained their tolerance but greatly augmented it since 1965. Not so our elites and gamers. They fought their way kicking and screaming into the global era, and Trump and the Restoration have been doing their level best to drag them kicking and screaming out of it. Why would we expect that upper class to be an iota more decent, cautious, wiser, less obnoxious, or less dangerous in its exit than it was in its entry?! Simultaneously in paradigm and regime crises, this society has to pull itself together again, but as 160 years ago under Abraham Lincoln, it has to do so in the right manner. To Reconcile or Not to Reconcile? That is the Question As the Restoration sees the circumstances of the United States in the new era unfolding, societies come apart for a time, and they must be brought together again through mutual adjustment and understanding. The immense difference that arose during the global era must be worked into a constructive and coherent relationship with the larger society; it must be made more understandable through conversation and learning, not seen as something alien and strange but as familiar variation along well-understood dimensions. We must learn to perceive the unity in seeming difference and make our country the dominant reference again. Reasons of overriding importance required that the work of multifaceted inclusion be undertaken; reasons of no less importance now compel harmonization between groups and classes. Most Americans have better learned since the 1960s to appreciate those of different racial and ethnic backgrounds, and, while relearning what is exceptional and exemplary about our country and its history, we must now emphasize doing the same with those of different classes. The wise path forward neither goes back to the omissions of the earnest and exemplary but imperfect universalisms of the early- and national-liberal paradigms and eras nor simply rejects multiculturalism; it rises above and overcomes the opposition between the earlier leadership and unifying devotion to the country amid lapses in accepting difference, and the global era’s selective sensitivity to difference amid multiple worse lapses. Yet, more than four years into the new era, we find no trace of the top gamers’ willingness to peacefully reconcile with their fellow citizens; we find only their solipsistic, “woke” ultimatums and conspiracies of escalating aggressiveness.

Yet, more than four years into the new era, we find no trace of the top gamers’ willingness to peacefully reconcile with their fellow citizens; we find only their solipsistic, “woke” ultimatums and conspiracies of escalating aggressiveness. Where the Restoration embraces reconciliation in a spirit of good will, the intensifying anti-universalism of the last 55 years arrogantly rejects it. Our elites’ negativism and conflictualism are no coincidence, for where the previous paradigms of liberal modernity were grounded in the Greco-Roman-Christian syntheses of late antiquity, the Middle Ages, the Renaissance, Reformation, and Enlightenment, the global-liberal paradigm pointedly was not. Gamers and multiculturalists have waged war on the universalism that made the United States and the West great, and they have brought disintegration and decline in their wake. The top gamers of the DPASM have intransigently doubled down on gamer multiculturalists’ unreason in the new era. So long as we retain our democracy, the choice is ours. The United States does not have to keep coming apart, and it does not have to continue in its senescence. The most difficult of all oppositions to reconcile are those between universalists and conflictualists, those who think in terms of, lean toward, and routinely justify conflict.370 Hard-core conflictualists, whether they be hardened criminals or most of our top gamers, are impervious to good will and the desire and ability to reconcile. Amid bad hombres with settled dispositions to foul play, good and fair-minded people’s only recourse is to sufficiently empower themselves that such people are either deterred from their wonted ill behavior or defeated in political or military conflict. The same thing goes with respect to the elites of the Chinese Communist Party. However important our country’s grave domestic challenges, the implications of the emerging paradigm alternatives for the Pax Americana, our national security, that of our friends and allies, and particularly for what is by far our largest national security threat, that posed by China, are even more important. We face a massive, determined, comprehensive, longterm Chinese juggernaut aimed systematically at world domination. They no longer even try to hide the fact. The global domination the Chinese Communist Party elite envisions for itself has a name as of Xi Jinping’s recent constitutional proclamations, the “community of common destiny.”371 Xi’s Belt and Road Initiative, investment in and movement toward domination of numerous strategic industries, extension of influence around the world, and consolidation of crushing totalitarianism at home are deeply rooted in the Dung regime’s paradigm of more than four-decades duration.

The overarching global ambition of the Communist Party in control of the resources of China’s 1.4 billion people is more dangerous than were those of the USSR forty years ago or Germany and Japan together eighty years ago. They are allocating huge resources to developing military technologies that could enable them to destroy the United States in a decisive first strike. This threat from China will be the crucible of the new era for the United States, Europe, Japan, India, South Korea, our other friends and allies, our several civilizations, and freedom and liberty everywhere. The prerequisite to achieving all other goals is that we overcome the many-sided security challenge China poses and do so by comprehensively defending ourselves and our allies to deter that adversary and others militarily if at all possible or by defeating them in war if we must. If the United States and its friends and allies are able to reconcile their domestic oppositions and revive the sense of the whole that they have allowed nihilist gamer multiculturalists to persuade them to abandon, we will in all likelihood be able to successfully meet this supreme challenge without even firing a bullet, and go on to work with all nations toward a world of peaceful accommodation. If we are not, we will yield to China’s cunning, expanding coercive grip, and the future will not be kind to this country, the West, or the world. Our elites’ frenzied irresponsibility has higher stakes than any of them realize. Only rising above our differences, marshaling our national resolve, building defenses, nurturing diplomatic relationships, and enacting international policies that leverage the advantages of freedom and humane constraints will enable us to secure the future. The sooner and more seriously we rise to this world-historical challenge, the better positioned we will be to address other crucial emerging challenges, particularly including the imminent domestic threats now present to our democracy. As we enter the new era, we may hope that it will be one of national Restoration whose most important domestic task is to reconcile difference, enabling us to work together as a strong, effective, humane, and free society. Much of the global era looks familiar and reassuring in the fading, slow-motion, rear-view cinematography: Its Pax Americana, global capitalism, democracy, and even aspects of its ascending gamers were natural developments of liberal modernity going back to 1500 and earlier, to liberalizing trends well established during the Middle Ages.

Even the era’s family disintegration and moral disorder were familiar, if anything but reassuring, but the gamers’ apotheosis of a multiculturalism that is profoundly anti-American, anti-Western, and utterly toxic to everything good, decent, liberal, democratic, or middle class is deeply disturbing. The contradictions, caroms, hubris, and pathos of gamer multiculturalism are right out of Euripides. It wrought devastating consequences wielding gratuitous guilt, for minorities, the United States, the West, and the world during its 51-year reign and continues to work them in its irascible dotage. If the angry groups and the top gamers fomenting and auctioning that anger were to continue on their course, they would come to tragedy. Like Medea and Pentheus, they would lose all as we who are bound to them would lose all. If that tragedy is to be averted, we have only a few years within which to be well under way with national restorations capable of guiding the United States and the West wisely through this time of massive upheaval and mortal trial, on the basis of reawakened seriousness and rediscovered national, civilizational, and global interests. he multiculturalism that began assuming a foundational place in the American consciousness already in the mid-1960s has done T so on the basis of a badly misleading narrative and false accusations that unjustly blame this exemplary country. In essence, its proponents have accused the United States of being a bad or even evil country for having had slavery during the first 75 years of its independence and for having declined to contest Jim Crow in the South as a national priority during the 85 years between 1880 and 1965. They have also regularly blamed this country for allegedly having continued to allow major and systemic prejudice toward and discrimination against group members to the present. So often as to become a mantra, gamer multiculturalists have asserted that Americans and particularly white, male, gentile Americans are an unworthy, bigoted, and anti-Semitic lot prone to prejudice and discrimination toward those who are different, beginning with blacks and extending to the expanding ranks of other multiculturalist groups. I would like to close with a critique of the multiculturalists’ narrative supporting those accusations against the United States, which were foundational to the global-liberal paradigm and era and have continued to be highly influential since, by placing it in the broader historical context that, sadly, is never provided in the press, the media, textbooks, lectures, or historical scholarship. This broader context reveals the extent to which multiculturalists have falsely accused, distortedly interpreted, and unfairly attacked this outstanding country, wrongly castigating the world’s indispensable nation", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634243384_cleaned.txt:225:1367b4377e9e", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 1415, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634243384_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634243384", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634243384_cleaned", "chunk_index": 226, "text": "with a critique of the multiculturalists’ narrative supporting those accusations against the United States, which were foundational to the global-liberal paradigm and era and have continued to be highly influential since, by placing it in the broader historical context that, sadly, is never provided in the press, the media, textbooks, lectures, or historical scholarship. This broader context reveals the extent to which multiculturalists have falsely accused, distortedly interpreted, and unfairly attacked this outstanding country, wrongly castigating the world’s indispensable nation and painting it over from hero to goat. As to the multiculturalists’ first accusation against the United States, pertaining to its having had slavery, I would aver that, to the contrary, this country, along with a few other exceptional liberal countries, is exemplary for having institutionalized liberty and abolished slavery. Indeed, its international leadership has forged the way in making free societies possible at all in our time and by enabling a majority of countries in the world to attain liberty and democracy. Without the United States there would have been no large societies in the world that were not hierarchical and did not institutionalize a great deal of coercive labor. America’s elite accusers never go far enough and broadly enough back in time to note the rarity and precariousness of liberty in world history. Riveted to next month’s or next year’s depredation, they would rather not acknowledge the fact that essentially all premodern civilized societies were extremely hierarchical, with elites like themselves ruling over subject masses seldom having more than insecure subsistence incomes and minimal control over their lives, that virtually the entire history of civilized humankind from 4000 BC until 1500 AD was hierarchical, and that the vast majority of it remained such until the late 20^(th) century. Elites and most gamers take their own liberty for granted and are unconcerned with anyone else’s. The foundations of modern liberty and modern democracy were laid in part during the Middle Ages as scores of free cities and a few relatively free small regions managed to escape the worst of elite exploitation. The Netherlands, among the freest of these regions, became home to the densest clustering of economic markets in the world by the end of the Middle Ages, supported by independent small farming unfettered by more than minimal feudalism. Its decisive turn into modern liberty and modernity occurred when the Netherlands (which then included today’s Belgium) with its commercial center in Antwerp, became the first liberal nation-state as its economy tipped predominantly from hierarchy to markets and its political system from authoritarianism to republicanism around 1500 AD. The emergence of a political coalition in the Netherlands between a flexible, relatively liberal aristocracy and the middle class during the Late Middle Ages made that beginning possible, as had the West’s cultural background of Christian universalism with its emphasis upon reconciliation.

The Low Countries were not fully or perfectly liberal, but they developed strong property rights and republican institutions over centuries around successively the counts of Flanders, dukes of Burgundy, and princes of Orange. Switzerland also came together early into a loose, liberal nation-state. The political experience of the Netherlands became a cornerstone of English and American liberty. England only became predominantly liberal and republican almost two centuries later with the Glorious Revolution of 1688. English citizens of different classes had had enough of the would-be absolutism of the Stuart monarchs who disrespected the country’s liberal achievements of the Middle Ages and Reformation. When democratic forces became strong enough to accept and defend self-determination and modernity, an upwelling of support arose for exiling King James II and bringing in the Netherlands’ Prince of Orange, widely known as a monarch who respected the economic and political markets, to become King William I of England. National leaders invited him and his Dutch army to depose the detested James – it helped that the prince’s wife Mary was the daughter of an earlier English king, Charles I, and became William’s co-monarch. Throngs of English citizens welcomed and cheered them as they marched to London. William and his supporters established the modern English democracy in this Glorious Revolution. As subject to the crown, colonial America was part of this great English transition too little remembered in the United States. Not long afterward, Sweden also became liberal. No democratic nation-states existed anywhere in the world in the late 18^(th) century other than a handful of European ones and the nascent United States. These countries’ epochal early-liberal transitions and those of the few other countries like France that joined them in the 19^(th) century developed analogous leading coalitions which represented the partial overcoming of difficult oppositions of class, culture, and institutional structure. They overcame comparable threats to liberty. Their powerful aristocracies controlled a great deal of land and labor, providing those classes with huge resources and leaving them with hierarchical experience and leanings. These liberal countries’ middle classes worked in independent businesses, craft shops, and small farms, leaving them with market experience and leanings. The aristocracies permitted capitalism and representative government only to the extent to which doing so coincided with their interests.

Those aristocracies entered early-liberal coalitions at all only after long, difficult processes of learning and reconciling where in a few places like Flanders and Alsace, some aristocrats slowly came to understand during the Middle Ages and afterward that instead of commanding and arbitrarily lording it over everyone and everything, they could increase their revenues by only moderately taxing the middle class and business, allowing them to flourish - in what was an early, precocious apperception of the subtle principle behind the Laffer curve. Liberty, modernity, and robust middle-class society hinged upon this delicate process of learning and reconciliation. Aristocrats had so much power and wealth that no one could think for centuries of comprehensively imposing middle-class norms and values upon them, infringing upon their traditional hierarchical rights, including that of coercing labor. There was no other chance for freedom than by long working patiently with relatively liberal aristocrats. Although slavery was peripheral to Western Europe in the Middle Ages, serfdom was widely practiced, and even in early-liberal societies many powerful aristocrats continued to own large estates with partially coerced labor and/or plantations abroad, or at home in the U.S. case. Moving from traditional hierarchical to modern liberal societies was an extremely long, difficult slog requiring cooperation and compromise with the relatively liberal sections of aristocracies, even when they owned slaves, until, centuries later, the middle class and its free institutions were strong enough to dominate on their own. The middle class did not become dominant in Britain until 1833 after passage of the Great Reform Act, and four years later in 1837 it democratically and peacefully abolished slavery throughout the British Empire, against the will of the resisting aristocracy. The success of that early-liberal coalition demanded the principled realism, steadiness, and patience of middle classes and their dedicated leaders. Each American colony had its distinct balance between aristocracy and middle class under the sovereignty of early-liberal Great Britain. Soon after the colonies became states within an independent, unified United States, our nation formed its own early-liberal coalition as reflected in the compromises embodied in the U.S. Constitution. That document reflected a power balance between the Northern states with their relatively strong middle classes and the Southern ones with their relatively strong aristocracies. Slavery was comparatively little present in the middle-class North and old Northwest; it was heavily present in the aristocratically dominated South. The Northern and Northwestern middle classes were not yet strong enough to begin manhandling the South over slavery until 1860 with the election of the nation’s first Republican president, Abraham Lincoln; and even then, it had to fight and win the", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634243384_cleaned.txt:228:7e38152eaa14", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 1418, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634243384_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634243384", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634243384_cleaned", "chunk_index": 229, "text": "the Northern states with their relatively strong middle classes and the Southern ones with their relatively strong aristocracies.

The Northern and Northwestern middle classes were not yet strong enough to begin manhandling the South over slavery until 1860 with the election of the nation’s first Republican president, Abraham Lincoln; and even then, it had to fight and win the Civil War to enforce that new domination. The ante-bellum United States was an early-liberal hybrid society that was partly free and partly authoritarian. The new United States under middle-class dominance was forged when the North and Northwest forcibly imposed modern liberal standards on the South, reconstituting and purging the country of aristocracy and slavery during the Civil War and Reconstruction. How could the solid, middle-class citizens of the United States, Great Britain, or the Netherlands have developed the strong free societies that eventually overcame aristocratic hierarchy and coercive labor without having worked together with relatively illiberal aristocrats for centuries, slowly and incrementally strengthening themselves and building the foundations of liberty? Had they indignantly fought all or nothing for complete liberty from the beginning, as our fake utopian multiculturalists would foolishly demand of them, they would have been crushed; and the West would have become one more of the world’s standard-issue hierarchical regions like China, Russia, and the Middle East. Engaging in utopian and quixotic revolution might have felt virtuous to out-of-touch idealists, but it would have been suicidal to their long-term cause and therefore morally wrong. Middle-class Europeans and Americans worked together with relatively flexible sections of aristocracies over centuries to lead their countries, the West, and then for a time a majority of the world’s nation-states to democracy and liberation from coerced labor and coerced conformity to elite dictates. Since all historical development has gone into, and, if fortunate, fought its way out of prolonged stages of authoritarianism, it is supremely ironic that hierarchally oriented gamer multiculturalists should blame, attack, and weaken the world’s leading democratic society, the United States, vis-à-vis its authoritarian adversaries international and domestic for having committed the imputed collective “original sin” of having fought its way out of authoritarianism!372 Putting up with morally repugnant slavery for centuries while slowly restricting and eventually abolishing it was the wise and necessary course under extremely difficult circumstances for those who loved liberty and justice and would one day sacrifice and prevail in building an even greater society.

Neither unscrupulous, hyperrealist top gamers nor their “useful idiots” whom our Leninists devote vast respources to manipulating, have sound historical analysis upon which to stand when they condemn the United States for having had slavery. But let us turn to the second spurious charge against this country and its citizens. As to elite multiculturalists’ second accusation against the United States, that it was immoral or even evil for having left Jim Crow to the states from about 1880 until 1965; this country had focused intensely upon the problem of race from the 1830s through the 1870s as it struggled peacefully to overcome slavery during the prewar decades, waged the Civil War during the early 1860s (by far this country’s bloodiest) when it had to, and then followed with Reconstruction to try to give emancipation as much substance in liberty as possible. After those wrenching, exhausting efforts to overcome slavery, circumstances required that our nation turn its focus in the 1880s to emerging priorities and largely put aside the issue of race. Gamer multiculturalists essentially argue that the American citizens who fought and supported the Civil War and maintained Reconstruction for fifteen years afterward before turning to other priorities, were immoral or even evil for having done so – that after losing some 700,000 dead in the war out of a population of 31 million. This loss represented approximately 2,250 of every 100,000 Americans. The Vietnam War, by comparison, took approximately 26 of every 100,000 Americans. We recall the extreme outrage and intense social protest about the sacrifice of life as the latter war was conducted, the way in which public opinion was so finished with the war by the mid-1970s that it threw away the successful outcome in hand, and the way in which it wanted nothing more to do with any such involvement for long afterward. Our country’s loss of life in the Civil War was approximately 87 times greater per capita than was that in the Vietnam War! Gamer multiculturalists nevertheless excoriate the battered, sickened, grieving, exhausted Americans of the 1870s and 1880s who had had the energy to keep the war going and Reconstruction afterward for another 15 years, even while they were enduring the depression of the mid-1870s and the unrest accompanying and following it.

Not only had the loss of life in the Civil War been staggering, but this country now had massive new problems to face. The ferment and agitation intensified in 1885 as the United States went into paradigm crisis for more than eleven years. Labor unrest became acute with the Haymarket bombing and riot in 1886, the Homestead strike and violence in 1892, and the nationwide railroad strike and disruption in 1894. By 1885 this country had grown immensely in territory and population. Its contiguous land area had more than tripled through the century to 3 million square miles, and its population had increased more than ten-fold to 56 million. The frontier had closed, and the now-continental country had no choice but to pull itself together into a governable and defensible nation. It had to do so while coping with the comprehensive, ramifying, unfamiliar effects of the industrial revolution, rise of large business, and urbanization. The late- ⋅ 19^(th) -century United States had to forge tens of millions of diverse, polyglot European immigrants, many of them with little or no experience of self-determination, into an effective democratic society together with their American predecessors. Most challenging, this country also had to take the lead in resolving the 31-year crisis – the larger West’s cataclysmic civil war, one might say – which was looming for decades, under way from 1914 to 1945, and followed at once by the Cold War defense against Soviet attempts at global expansion. After the late- 19^(th) -century paradigm crisis was resolved with the election of William McKinley as president in 1896, the United States began in earnest to overcome every one of those complex and daunting problems over the next seven decades. The magnitude of what this country took on and accomplished during the national era was stupendous. Given the colossal new structural and existential challenges the United States faced and the widespread devastation and deep bitterness in the defeated South, the opportunity costs would have been prohibitive for it to have to have continued prioritizing the divisive and refractory issue of race. Of course Jim Crow with its continuing prejudice and discrimination was bad, but where did its injustice rank among all of the harmful conditions this country had to face during the national era? What would the costs and risks have been of continuing to take on race as a focal concern at the national level under the circumstances?

Could we have put aside adaptation to the industrial revolution, large business, or urbanization? Could we have put aside participation in World War I or World War II? Or could we have pursued armistices rather than the complete surrenders of Nazi Germany and Japan in the latter war? Under the circumstances, the wise and moral course for the country was not at all to neglect but to benignly deprioritize racial problems at the national level, to for the most part let the states deal with them as best they could during the era. After World War II, some relaxation took place in the generations of Americans who had pulled the gigantic load for this country and the world. A decade and a half later, the relaxation was fuller as a moment of respite, release, and hope arrived with President Kennedy, if a bit prematurely until the Cuban missile crisis was over and Khrushchev had stepped down. Thirteen months after that perilous confrontation, tensions with the USSR had subsided, Kennedy was assassinated, Johnson was newly sworn in as president, and the United States could allow itself to address omissions of its aging but venerable national-liberal paradigm and society. Once a level of security had been reached in which the country’s most basic and pressing needs had been successfully met for a time, it could again devote sustained attention and energy to problems of collective justice regarding race. The last finale of the national era then arrived quickly with passage of the equal rights provisions of the landmark civil rights laws of 1964 and 1965, but it was not the grand finale – that had been 1945. Days after passage of the second law, the Watts riot broke out, the country was badly shaken, 1880sand 1890s-scale turmoil was again upon us, the waning national-liberal paradigm and era expired, and the global-liberal paradigm and era began unfolding. Under completely different circumstances, the no less terrible Detroit riot of 1942 had rightly fallen upon deaf, impatient ears. By 1965, the United States again had circumstances that allowed it to work hard to overcome its remaining problems of collective injustice. That does not mean it would conceptualize equal rights in a way that boded well for the country or choose constructive policies with which to try to bring them about.

Such monumental sleight of hand required both the distraction that only inflamed racial tensions could provide and execution that only the slipperiest of top gamers in Lyndon Johnson could pull off, as fitting a stroke with which to introduce the troubled new era as was his contrivance of the Tonkin Gulf incident. Whether our having struggled all out to end slavery earlier than we did would have done more good than harm is vital counterfactual historical analysis that is virtually never engaged in. No one who looks carefully at how precarious the Union effort was in the Civil War, almost throughout, even with the new industrial might of the North and Northwest behind it, is likely to conclude that this country would have been advised to wage that war earlier than it did. Whether it would have been wise to continue with the problem of race to the fore during the national era is another necessary analysis that essentially never took place amid the anger, din, myopia, and excess of the 1960s and early 1970s and never takes place today. Nor were the rapidly improving economic conditions of black Americans through the national era much noticed or discussed during those years of paradigm change. Gamer multiculturalists excise such exonerating historical context from the narrative. Multiculturalists’ additional core accusation against the United States was that it was continuing to permit major and systemic prejudice and discrimination toward minorities during the global era. Multiculturalists subscribe to a foundational myth about race and ethnicity in America that may not always have been a misrepresentation but has long been one. The myth is that white Americans are disproportionate perpetrators of racism and black Americans disproportionate recipients of it, that Anglos are disproportionate perpetrators of injustice toward Hispanics and they disproportionate victims of it, and that gentiles are disproportionate perpetrators of antagonism and Jews disproportionate victims of it. Those charges are untrue! There is as much prejudice and discrimination by blacks against whites in the United States, as much ethnic aggression by Hispanics as by Anglos, as much negative sentiment by Jews as by gentiles (regarding this last, little in either direction by the way).

There is patently not a surplus of virtue in U.S. minorities and vice in the majority, and it is prejudicial falsehood to assert otherwise. Consider that 85 percent of violent crime occurring between blacks and whites is committed by blacks,374 or try having a white child attend an overwhelmingly black-dominated inner-city school. Watch the brutal bullying of Anglo children in many Hispanic-dominated neighborhoods and schools or the harassment of Anglo women in the Southwest. As to gentile-Jewish relations, a few with resentment here and there the one way, a few with contempt here and there the other amid a great deal of intermarriage and excellent relations overall. Human nature is complex enough that one is never going to achieve perfect harmony between racial and ethnic groups. Considering its great diversity and all aspects of needed adjustment, the United States has done as good a job with collective justice as any country in the world. Vis-à-vis these relationships, let’s just call it a wash and work to reduce rather than exacerbate the abrasion. In negating the American, Western, Christian, and classical traditions, multiculturalists have hardly been aware of the neurotic, socially constructed resentment permeating their paradigm. They are allergic to self-abnegation and self-punishment in their personal lives but wantonly sadistic in their practice of collective self-abnegation and self-punishment. They cannot cease their rhythmic, vengeful flailing upon society. Like Sam Shepard’s Henry Moss, they breathe and they yell.375 This modern, democratic United States of America is not to blame for slavery, it is not to blame for Jim Crow, and it is not to blame for ghetto demoralization. Multiculturalism and identity politics lead toward endless division, acrimony, despair, and dysfunction; toward segmentary structures like those of Austro-Hungary, Yugoslavia, Lebanon, Rwanda, and South Africa; toward failed societies, the ruin of the West, and the end of democracy. While the United States needed to pay increased attention to race relations in 1965, the multiculturalist framework under which this was carried out was radical, negative, one-sided, and destructive to this and every other country that accepted it. When so many come to consider themselves outsiders and bear resentment toward and disparage their society, who is to lead or otherwise contribute to that society, and what happens if no one does?

All of this means nothing to today’s elites whose modus operandi we know well by now. They have zero inclination toward either the truth or fair mindedness, they use anything they can as a cudgel against anyone who significantly opposes them. They bring slash and burn political conflict on behalf of their personal and class agendas to what was not long ago a respectful democratic conversation. They use group blame and division as tools, laying waste to our country and countless millions of its citizens’ lives. These elites do not grasp that if they continue on their march to dictatorship, they themselves will be its most likely victims. At a certain point they lose control. For Girondins are succeeded by Jacobins and Mensheviks by Bolsheviks. In Rubashov’s meditations while awaiting execution, Arthur Koestler’s novel Darkness at Noon poignantly describes the nightmarishly vacillating razor’s edge of conformity demanded of everyone but especially of elites once civil liberties and the rule of law are gone.376 As Nikolai Bukharin and Alexei Rykov learned in Moscow and Trotsky in Mexico, there is no escape. Yet perhaps the greatest irony is that our elite aspiring dictators, oligarchs, and commissars use bogus historical blame to discredit this outstanding liberal society as a means toward their own authoritarian and ultimately totalitarian rule, which then inevitably brings its new slaves, new genocides, new ethnic cleansing, new misogyny, and new lifestyle taboos. Except for the all-too-rare heroic leaders of the new era, one should never listen to a thing our elites say except to critically pry apart and combat their ceaseless machinations and deceit. Edith Hamilton’s reflections from nearly a century ago upon the fall of Rome bear pondering: Rome toward the end, she says, was most lacking in “wisdom and disinterestedness…. If the people had held together, realizing their interdependence and working for a common good, their problems, completely strange and enormously difficult though they were, would not, it may well be believed, have proved too much for them. But they were split into sharpest oppositions, extremes that ever grew more extreme and so more irresponsible.”377 Always oppose our elites so long as they remain divisive and destructive; always fight to reduce their power and resources, open their monopolies to competition, lay bare the wreckage they strew, and shine light upon their nefarious schemes – and we might just barely hold on to our freedom and humanity, against the odds, through the extremely rocky decades to come. 2.

Paradigms provide much of the deep structure of eras, societies, and personalities. Since truly fathoming their own complexity and that of circumstances is overwhelming, people finesse the task by assembling and clasping models that guide what they perceive, think, feel, and do. Paradigms stake out positions on the dimensions of the human, pinning down existential abodes for a time. Their basic assumptions are for the most part unconsciously held. 3. This definition utilizes the traditional European sense of the word “liberal” as relatively free and unregulated on all issues. The other major sense of “liberal” is the current American one of being in favor of free markets in social and cultural spheres but being in favor of expanded hierarchy or government activity in the economy. Both senses are used as needed. 5. Under the Pax Britannica, Britain employed its considerable diplomatic, financial, and military power to discourage aggressive and destabilizing action by countries large and small, upholding a basic peace within which economies and societies could flourish. Not only was military aggression between states largely deterred, but mercantilism was also largely overcome for nearly a century, between 1815 and 1914. 6. The notion of the Pax Americana or “American world order,” as Kagan terms it in The World America Made, is an extrapolation from Karl Polanyi’s notion of the Pax Britannica in his classic work of history and social thought, The Great Transformation (chap. 1). One of the strengths of the concept is that it facilitates a distinction between the informal leadership by and of liberal countries from anything that could be fairly described as imperial. The United States has never really had an empire, nor does it today. Its leadership has been achieved by the willing assent and cooperation of its friends and allies. Those who label U.S. international leadership since 1945 “imperial” (after the British or Roman Empire), such as Niall Ferguson in Colossus, fail to distinguish sufficiently between Britain’s leadership of developed countries in Europe under the Pax Britannica and its simultaneous colonial domination over India, Rhodesia, and dozens of other less-developed societies under the British Empire.

Speaking of the Pax Americana is in no way intended to slight the major roles played in the security regime by other important participants, above all the United Kingdom, which has been the United States’ co-leader throughout – nor is the term intended to exaggerate the role of the United States. The Pax Americana could not have existed without the core allies. Yet nor could the international security regime have existed without the United States. Even more than in the nineteenth century, one nation has been the security regime’s preeminent leader, and without acknowledging and analyzing this fact, one loses touch with reality. Unfortunately, the notion of a Pax Americana also unavoidably evokes the notion of the Pax Romana.

As a screenplay writer, I instinctively looked for the “inciting incident.” What caused the 1960s? What caused my generation to turn its back on our parent’s trajectory of Post Modernism and Post-industrial life, and to create a whole new lifestyle that has profoundly altered American culture? I remember Dr. Stephen Rust first asked me to address what created the 1960s New Hollywood for a presentation to his Introduction to Film class back in the spring of 2012. And it was the same question that Dr. Alilunas asked in a different way about Cinema 7, an Arthouse from the 70s that I was a part of, and that he had completed a lot of research on before I met him in 2019. What those manifestations of our generation had in common was the Poetic Cinema genre of the 1960s. This poetic cinema was just one of many artistic expressions of the time, including the arts in music, literature, architecture, fashion, and film; but it was steeped in a massive counter-culture movement against every single tenet of “civilized society;” basically turning them all on their head in an 180-degree arc, and by doing so exposed their uncivilized dark sides.2 For instance, we turned away from Monotheism to Spiritualism, from a War Culture to a Peace Culture, From Capitalism to Socialism, from Patrimonialism to Feminism, from Conservatism to Liberalism, from Racism to Civil Rights, from exploiting the natural resources of the Earth to saving the Earth, and last but not least, from Colonialism to Indigeneity. It was by turning back from Modernism and Post-modernism to pre-industrial values, a return from the Age of Reason to Yeatsian Symbolism, a return from scientific values to human ones; that we found ourselves in direct opposition to our parents’ generation. But that is not all, our culture was brought together by protesting the war in Vietnam. The SDS supported the Student Strike sparked by Black Student Unions’ demanding Black Studies at San Francisco State. The Black Panthers supported Vietnam War protesters; students of all colors came together to support the American Indian Student Union, all of us reeling under the pressures of a system that didn’t work for us, and we were forced to became “subversives” by society. As Malcolm X said: “ Europeanism has been such a strong poison for centuries it now becomes essential to emphasize Africanism to counteract it & Arabism to counteract Zionism, socialism to counteract capitalism etc.”3 What also brought us together back then was our art, and the metaphors and symbolism in our art was what became the new language of our bicultural voice, a kind of code.

That voice is what this book is going to focus on. And as a screenplay writer knows, it all began with an inciting incident, a conflict, one that set the trajectory of our generation (particularly in the U.S.) in reaction to the Apocalyptic assassinations of our generation’s heroes, John F. Kennedy, Martin Luther King, Jr., Robert Kennedy; and the H-Bomb and resulting Bomb Shelters; the Cuban Missile Crisis and the Cold War. But there was something deeper than that. A lot of us children of the 40s and 50s could not relate to the pursuit of money and status, nor the religions of our fathers and mothers, to their love of plastic, to modernist architecture, Denny’s restaurants; nor their music, their tv shows and especially, their movies. John Wayne was fine for the Post War reconstruction mythology of their generation. But while most of our parents’ generation just heard about the WWII sirens in London and violence in far-away Pearl Harbor; as 50s children we were seeing sirens everywhere, and were building bomb shelters at home. And we needed more than they could give us, such as deeper understandings of Spirituality, including a new, more powerful American mythology; a new art, a new music, a new cuisine, a new politics and especially a new Cinema to embody all of that. The H-bomb in itself caused us to think on a sub-atomic level. The Space program also caused us to think about eternity, the Cosmos and the vastness of Space. All of this led to an openness to new ideas like quantum mechanics and astrology. And when we heard “One small step for man, and one giant step for Mankind” as we also saw, from space, a rather holistic image of our beautiful and fragile Earth, we immediately knew that we were all part of a cohesive whole, that our countries really had no borders, we were all one Family of Man. And that was why the excuses for the Vietnam war, that my generation was asked to die for; did not make any sense. So if we look at this period from a microscopic quantum mechanics viewpoint, we see that “as below” is truly “as above.” And that the “above” was being addressed by William Butler Yeats in his widely read yet terrifying poem “Second Coming”; it was being addressed by Walt Disney in his animated archetypal “children’s stories” which borrowed", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634243568_cleaned.txt:1:d48538c0900d", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 1429, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634243568_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634243568", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634243568_cleaned", "chunk_index": 2, "text": "And that was why the excuses for the Vietnam war, that my generation was asked to die for; did not make any sense.

And by reaching towards these metaphors from pre-history, to describe this understanding, we found ourselves astronomically aware of things like Plato’s cave and his theory of the Aeon, a 2000 year old “widening gyre” which ruled the culture of the Age of Aries; and was countered by a new gyre 2000 years later in the Age of Pisces, whose spiritual emanation was coded as “The Divine Male, Christ, or Fisher of Men” and “the Fisher King.” “Not without reason do we date our era from the age of Augustus, for that epoch saw the birth of the symbolical figure of Christ, who was invoked by the early Christians as the Fish, the Ruler of the Aeon of Pisces which had just begun. He became the ruling spirit of the next two thousand years. Like the teacher of wisdom in Babylonian legend, Cannes, he rose up from the sea, from the primeval darkness, and brought a world-period to an end. It is true that he said, “I am come not to bring peace but a sword.”4 Aion, for Jung, also embodied an astrological age – that of Aquarius – which, in its imagery and meaning, combines the human form of the Water Bearer with its opposite constellation of Leo, the lion. W.B. Yeats, preoccupied with the same zodiacal polarity, described his own vision of the approaching New Age in his poem, “The Second Coming,” written just after the Armageddon of the Great War, with a prophetic pessimism not unlike Jung’s own: a terrifying being with a lion’s body and the head of a man “slouching toward Bethlehem to be born” in the midst of chaos and social disintegration.5 If it is true that the Tarot Deck is a codex of the history of the world, as some Jungian analysts do, perhaps humanity in the next quote is the balance achieved between the masculine and feminine, as portrayed in the rather androgynous image of The Star, in the Tarot, which came right after the Tower depicting 911: The major theme of Jung’s Aion is the shift in human consciousness and a simultaneous shift in the god-image, reflected in the ending of the Piscean age.

In Jung’s view, Pisces is associated with the Christian symbols of Jesus and Satan as the two fish. The advent of the Aquarian aion is associated with a new symbol: humanity as the Water Bearer. Jung believed that each of the great shifts represented by a new astrological aion is reflected in the imagery of the presiding zodiacal constellation and its planetary ruler: Apparently they are changes in the constellations of psychic dominants, of the archetypes, or “gods” as they used to be called, which bring about, or accompany, long-lasting transformations of the collective psyche. This transformation started in the historical era and left its traces first in the passing of the aeon of Taurus into that of Aries, and then of Aries into Pisces, whose beginning coincides with the rise of Christianity. We are now nearing that great change which may be expected when the spring-point enters Aquarius.6 According to gnostic philospher Samael Aun Weor, this spring point entered on Feb. 4th, 1962;7 and led to where we are now in the great scheme of things, from where this emanation from the Universe began – the Age of Aquarius symbolically represented by an androgynous human as The Star in the Tarot Deck pouring out stars over the Universe, like blessings, from an alabaster jar. But it was affecting more than just the Youth of America; it was happening all over Europe; all over the Near East, in Africa and Asia, in Tibet, Bangladesh, and France. This “great change” started a few years before in the 50s as we came of age, created a crisis that the world found itself in, which also created subversive filmmakers in Czechoslovakia, like Milos Forman, who directed Cuckoo’s Nest and Roman Polanski from Poland. It created Akira Kurosawa and Rashomon; it created Satyajit Ray, Jean Renoir, Italian Neo-realism, the Nouvelle Vague in France, and the German New Wave. Then what followed was the American Underground with counter-culture films exploring the clash between us and this crisis culture around drug deals: Easy Rider; Satanic Cults: Rosemary’s Baby; Sex: Midnight Cowboy (the first X-rated movie to win an Academy Award); Violence: Bonnie & Clyde and more Sex: The Graduate.

No Subtitles Necessary is a great documentary about cinematographers like Vilmos Zsigmond and Laszlo Kovacs, from Hungary, who not only spoke this bicultural language, but let their cameras be “the poetic and bicultural third voice.” If this book has an underlying thesis discovered while researching the project, I propose that what Kesey and the Eugene Poetic [underground] Cinema community he inspired helped us to better understand, is that before the beginning (before the word) was consciousness. The literary theory deconstructionists like Walter Benjamin, Jacques Derrida, Paul de Man, Peter de Bolla and Raymond Williams all danced around this word consciousness. And like them, when Ken Kesey tried to interpret this culture, (like everyone who tries to talk about archetype) he could “speak of it only in myth and allegory;” such as he did when writing One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest (1962). In a nutshell, by looking to Plato for understanding the turning points of eons, to the poet Yeats to envision its timing, to Jung to unpack it symbolically and give it a name it, to Northrup Frye to see and understand it through Yeats’ poetry, we can see how Ken Kesey later embodied Yeats’ revolt against the Intellect. After all, it was The Age of Reason that had caused it, the post-industrial world, and the eve of mass of destruction during WWI, when man first murdered millions using machines, and escalated in WWII. Kesey took up that battle cry and as a new Meta-modernist, led us away from scientific logic and returned us to magic with archaic symbolism and ritual through the use of ancient modes of accessing primordial consciousness. As I said before, “As above, so below,” because these events were all predicted by ancient astrological configurations, as if the Universe was indeed intelligence and had mathematically pre-ordained our generation as an anathema to the former ones. No other generation had been exposed to space travel and sub-atomic particles like this at the same time. And as a result of drug use we were able to grasp things like Unified Field theories of quantum mechanics; as was portrayed, using a Cinematic trope, “The Universe in a thumbnail” as in Animal House.

But it was Kesey who first helped us interpret this 1960s Platonian and Neo-Platonian “emanation from the Universe,” that reigns over an “aeon or aion or eon”; as well as participating in fulfilling the prophesy of the Hopi Indians (“This is the Eighth Sign: You will see many youth, who wear their hair long like my people, come and join the tribal nations, to learn their ways and wisdom…”)8 and he even helped answer the rhetorical question from the final line of William Butler Yeats’ Second Coming: “And what rough beast, its hour come round at last, Slouches towards Bethlehem to be born?”9 And the answer is The Metamorphosized Sphinx. From animal to human to Jung’s Paraclete.10 The youth movement was also fueled by Ken Kesey’s Acid Trips, that Ken began in the Bay Area in 1962 (3 years after volunteering “to take part in a CIA-financed study named Project MKULTRA at the Menlo Park Veterans Hospital” in 1959) where he was given peyote and LSD. Kesey then continued to take the drugs while attending Stanford University, and said that the first chapter of One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest was written on Peyote, especially the mixed-race Indian who narrated the story. When the chemist Owsley manufactured LSD-25, private “Acid Trips” began with the Merry Pranksters, who then decided for the publishing of Kesey’s second novel, Sometimes a Great Notion, they would take an “Intrepid Trip” to New York in 1964, in a Psychedelic-painted school bus. Upon returning, they organized the first of the “Acid Tests” at Ken Babbs’ house on November 27th, 1965 with The Warlocks, who soon became the Grateful Dead. LSD ART exploded, psychedelic bands blossomed, and filmmakers from San Francisco State were right there filming it. Soon, loving collectives began to foster collaboration, like the biggest psychedelic poster artists: Wes Wilson, Stanley Mouse, Alton Kelley, and Rick Griffin, who worked together to create the Haight/Ashbury Ballroom Music Posters, some of them worth more than $100, 000 today. Rusty Goldman was born and raised in San Francisco, had a “Big Brother” who was involved in the scene, became a collector of these posters ever since he was 15. He was so knowledgeable about them that one of the Big 5 Artists, Wes Wilson named him Professor Poster, and he had this to say: “When the Music’s finally finished", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634243568_cleaned.txt:5:14c56ed59f21", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 1433, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634243568_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634243568", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634243568_cleaned", "chunk_index": 6, "text": "Griffin, who worked together to create the Haight/Ashbury Ballroom Music Posters, some of them worth more than $100, 000 today.

She told me recently: “I was just fascinated with the idea of California, the beats and jazz, the politics. I always liked rock music as well. It was in 1965 that I met Bill Graham and became his first secretary, as my husband worked for him. I was a paralegal, got off work early and went to the Fillmore Auditorium. Bill asked me if I knew how to write a press release. Boom, I had a new job. Anyway I remained good friends with Bill for years.” After 12 years, she found a new passion: “In 1977 I went to work for the Haight/Ashbury Free Medical Clinic for David Smith, the founder. During the next 12 years I worked all of Bill’s shows as Rock Medicine, medical teams, and we always took time to talk about ourselves, our children, etc. Bill was very connected also to The Committee here in SF.”12 This kind of collaboration was everywhere, and film was at the heart of it all, documenting it. The film collective, Canyon Cinema was lucky enough to have my friend Loren Sears involved. Loren was an early computer engineer who became known for inventing the optical printer, and his films were recently shown at Cannes to celebrate their 50th Anniversary. Many of these films became important, documenting Native Tribes as well as the San Francisco scene in 1967. Loren called them Tribal Home Movies13 for a reason … the American Indian Ethic inspired us: its ritual, spirituality, tolerance for people of all cultures, revered feminism, love and respect for the Earth, communal living, strong family values, and colorful creativity. Its culture embraced archaic songs, drums, totems, even occasional plant-based drug use and wisdom handed down from the eons. The infamous Lakota tribal member Russell Means, my dear friend, actor and musician (from the Pine Ridge Reservation; the first National Director of AIM, the American Indian Movement) used to call this ethic “The Great Mystery.” It was that Great Mystery that my generation was looking for. And we found it, too, in Yeatsian symbolism and deconstructive language and poetry, that informed and created Poetic Cinema.

Stan Brakhage tried to discuss this bicultural linguisticity when he said: “Imagine an eye untutored by man-made laws of perspective, an eye unprejudiced by compositional logic, an eye which does not respond to the name of everything, but which must know each object encountered in life through an adventure of perception … imagine a world before (in the) beginning was the word.”14 My theory is that Kesey and the Poetic Cinema Movement that he helped inspire allows us to perceive that which was before “in the beginning was the word,” and that it was consciousness. And that consciousness was The Great Mystery which called to us. And expressed through us, through our music, our art, our lifestyles and our cinema. And that the 60s was just a beginning, just a window, to now, and that now and the immediate future is going to only be interpretable through this 60s bi-cultural voice, the “Metaphors of Vision” that is Yeatsian in its symbolism, and Shelley-like in its radical aestheticism. We hope it will overcome the bastardization of the word by human unconsciousness; during this Tower moment in history; this Babelian time when no one can understand each other, from all of the media spins of words, manipulated by money, of the very meanings of words, rendering most of them incomprehensible. There is a reason why young people are on a social platform that limits words to 240 characters; and on the primarily visual Snapchat, Facebook, and Instagram. They are tired of words. But every picture tells a story. The truth is that we cannot separate images from consciousness, and we cannot manipulate words without consequences. They must be re-connected to the symbolism that birthed them. Which is why it is going to take the bicultural to straddle the gap between the archaic and the quantum future – the Alpha and the Omega – the primitive symbol and the quantum word; which requires a third language to bridge that gap, and a bicultural generation to find the equivalent of this “lost chord” of harmony between the linear word that is heard and seen and the visual that is seen and felt; the 1000 miles between the intellect and the heart.

He gave away no secrets of the Order; and yet he used continually a method won by long and hard work in a language studied today by few, but intrinsically valid, and which will therefore outlast the ignorance of the time. Even since Yeats pursued truths in his time and in our own so unfashionable, that revolt of the soul against intellect which he himself predicted has manifested itself in many ways, and at the time of writing wears the aspect, even, of revolution among the younger generation, prepared to take the archetypal world by storm. Truths so vital, so intrinsic to our very nature, cannot with impunity be denied. Jung wrote that “consciousness torn from its roots and no longer able to appeal to the authority of the primordial images, possesses a Promethean freedom, it is true, but it also partakes of the nature of a godless hybris. Y es, it’s true. We were like the Fool. My generation packed a knap-sack and stuck out our thumbs hitch-hiking, and then steppedoff the cliff into a different dimension when we heard a calling, a deep, resonating feeling that we needed to leave the life we had known and travel to San Francisco to find a new way of being in the world. Our childhoods in America were so full of trauma, we did not want to inherit the world. There had to be a better way. And we found it. We are still finding it. While the world rages on in post-industrial post-modernism, we have opted out. But I don’t think we would have ever stepped off the cliff, if we weren’t pushed by the Cuban Missile Crisis, sending us as children to create makeshift nuclear bomb shelters in our basements in 1962; by the murder of our heroes, John F. Kennedy, 1963; Martin Luther King, 1968; and Robert Kennedy; 1968, then the government drafting our classmates to die in the Vietnam war starting in 1961; our total disbelief in our own government after the Warren Commission Report was released in 1964; and the cover of Time magazine rhetorically asking us if “Is God Dead?” in 1966.17 Nietzsche used the phrase to sum up the effect and consequence that the Age of Enlightenment had had on the centrality of the concept of God within Western European civilization, which had been essentially Christian in character since the later Roman Empire.

The Enlightenment had brought about the triumph of scientific rationality over sacred revelation; the rise of philosophical Materialism and Naturalism that to all intents and purposes had dispensed with the belief in or role of God in human affairs and the destiny of the world. Nietzsche recognized the crisis that this “Death of God” represented for existing moral assumptions in Europe as they existed within the context of traditional Christian belief.18 When one gives up the Christian faith, one pulls the right to Christian morality out from under one’s feet. This morality is by no means self-evident … By breaking one main concept out of Christianity, the faith in God, one breaks the whole: nothing necessary remains in one’s hands.”[15] This is why in “The Madman,” a passage which primarily addresses nontheists (especially atheists), the problem is to retain any system of values in the absence of a divine order. God is dead. God remains dead. And we have killed him. How shall we comfort ourselves, the murderers of all murderers? What was holiest and mightiest of all that the world has yet owned has bled to death under our knives: who will wipe this blood off us? What water is there for us to clean ourselves? What festivals of atonement, what sacred games shall we have to invent? Is not the greatness of this deed too great for us? Must we ourselves not become gods simply to appear worthy of it?19 The mystical life is the centre of all that I do & all that I think & all that I write. It holds to my work the same relation that the philosophy of Godwin held to the work of Shelley & I have always considered myself a voice of what I believe to be a greater renaissance- the revolt of the soul against the intellect – now beginning in the world.20 Their daughter, Mary Wollstonecraft Godwin, would marry the poet Shelley and then write Frankenstein; or Modern Prometheus. Her father William Godwin was a brilliant thinker, as was his wife, who wrote “The Vindications of Women” as a proto-feminist; but their daughter had both of their brilliances and wrote Frankenstein as an indictment of post-industrialism, as well as an indictment of the patriarchal imbalance, of denying the feminine intel- So, given the hell we were living in then, I stuck my thumb out underneath the “Weed/San Francisco” sign at the west end of Main Street where it joined Highway 97, in the town", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634243568_cleaned.txt:9:d30cc02e295b", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 1437, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634243568_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634243568", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634243568_cleaned", "chunk_index": 10, "text": "a brilliant thinker, as was his wife, who wrote “The Vindications of Women” as a proto-feminist; but their daughter had both of their brilliances and wrote Frankenstein as an indictment of post-industrialism, as well as an indictment of the patriarchal imbalance, of denying the feminine intel- So, given the hell we were living in then, I stuck my thumb out underneath the “Weed/San Francisco” sign at the west end of Main Street where it joined Highway 97, in the town I was born in, Klamath Falls, Oregon; late November 1966. My Mom had left me and my Dad and my brothers and sister the week before. I was the oldest, 15, and had “complex” PSTD from growing up there, in a County with the most murders per capita in the nation for 6 years in a row, and when I was 5, had inadvertently watched my neighbor murder his wife over an argument about tuning in a different radio station in the car, next door. There were 13 murders in one year in the tiny (500 people) American Indian Reservation town of Chiloquin, which was boarded up from the Government’s Termination of the Klamath and Modoc Tribes, all of which broke A few months later, things had become so bad at home I even decided to pray. My family’s church was close to my high school. It was empty on a school day, and I went in, terrified. But I prayed. This act restored a faith I never really knew I had, because my prayers were answered when my Mom got in a car wreck, got the flu, and it made her come back. But I think it was under Mom’s one condition, and that was that we moved to Eugene, near where her Dad and his 1870 family farm was. So I was then enrolled at South Eugene High School. And it turned out to be a much better way to get to San Francisco, to go North in order to go South; because now I had the best of both worlds, friends that took me to The City for shows at the Avalon, Fillmore, Matrix and Berkeley Community Theater, and in the Summer between High School and College, July 8th, 1969; Ken Kesey’s Psychedelic Bus came by and I got on. San Francisco had come to me.

The light of a Platonic Aeon emerging from the 2000-year Piscean Age, the “widening gyre” of Aquarius. This phase must be brought to understand by what means it has knowledge of the thing it sees and warrant for what it affirms: if it became what it affirms, it would by that fact possess self-knowing. All its vision and affirmation being in the Supreme or deriving from it- There where itself also is – it will possess self-knowledge by its right as a Reason-Principle, claiming its kin and bringing all into accord with the divine imprint upon it. Our 60s generation was born23 into a culture symbolically encoded with iconic images of both the atom and rockets to outer space; and as a result of being exposed to both the subatomic science that created the Nuclear Cuban Missile Crisis and the astrophysicist’s skill in navigating the vastness of space (as accomplished in the Moon Landing) you could say that in trying to grasp such a vastness, we were forced to embrace a quantum level of what might be called consciousness. Like our ancient forefathers, (especially since we watched the skies a lot in the 60s) we looked to the skies to not only warily watch out for Armageddon, but to try to understand and interpret this thing called consciousness; specifically in the context of newer theoretical science and quantum mechanics, like the Heisenberg Principle of Uncertainty and the Higgs-Bosun; as well as those interpretations found in the I Ching, ancient religions like Buddhism, Hinduism, or even Religious Science; as well as prophesies and more archaic ways of understanding like Astrology, the Egyptian Book of the Dead, the Hopi Prophesies, the Tarot and Shamanic Psychotropic drug use, etc. that were also all about consciousness. Literary theorist Raymond Williams seems to talk about this very thing in his “Dominant Residual and Emergent” theory when he was discussing how difficult it was for a new “culture” like ours to emerge during a Dominant mode like the 50s because: “… there is always other social being and consciousness which is neglected and excluded: alternative perceptions of others, in immediate relationships; new perceptions and practices of the material world.” His theory is important because I hope to show how the pre- emergent 60s had not yet become dominant, nor is it now residual.

It is just now beginning to widen as a gyre of time. Which means it is pre-emergent. Something that we need what Williams calls a “structure of feeling” to understand. Here is the structure:”24,25 But at the time, in the early 60s when it was at its narrowest point, just a pin-prick coming from Pre-emergence, and not yet visible; and given that Quantum Mechanics was so rarefied in its understanding; we found that astrology provided a few ways that were helpful to understand what exactly it was that we were feeling; because it was also what helped us to find that elusive meaning, just like Yeats had found, and gave us what Literary deconstructionist Raymond Williams called “a structure of feeling,”27 to describe it. This curiosity was indeed induced and fostered by a certain feeling, a phenomenon that felt like an emanation of the Universe strongly calling from the future, the heavens, or perhaps even from the archaic past. I do not use the word feeling lightly, because feelings are not facts in the Post-industrial world, and cannot be used as proof in a court of law for instance, and therefore not very academic, but this is what Williams said in 1977: What matters, finally, in understanding emergent culture, as distinct from both the dominant and the residual, is that it is never only a matter of immediate practice; indeed it depends crucially on finding new forms or adaptations of form. Again and again what we have to observe is in effect a pre-emergence, active and pressing but not yet fully articulated, rather than the evident emergence which could be more confidently named. It is to understand more closely this condition of pre-emergence, as well as the more evident forms of the emergent, the residual, and the dominant, that we need to explore the concept of structures of feeling.28 A current best-selling author and NYT Book Reviewer Sheila Weller recalled this particular feeling as “a high whistle audible only to hidden soulmates” by which “seekers in their 20s started moving to San Francisco.”23 Many of my friends and I can also agree with Stanley, a famous Rock-n-Roll Poster maker of the 60s, who said this about the feeling Weller describes: It was the artists, musicians, poets and philosophers, as always, who first heard that voice, that beat, that new archetype of expression emerging throughout the culture; artists like William Butler Yeats, who in his 1919 poem “Second Coming”; had predicted an event he believed", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634243568_cleaned.txt:12:a7da4b817036", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 1440, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634243568_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634243568", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634243568_cleaned", "chunk_index": 13, "text": "“seekers in their 20s started moving to San Francisco.”23 Many of my friends and I can also agree with Stanley, a famous Rock-n-Roll Poster maker of the 60s, who said this about the feeling Weller describes: It was the artists, musicians, poets and philosophers, as always, who first heard that voice, that beat, that new archetype of expression emerging throughout the culture; artists like William Butler Yeats, who in his 1919 poem “Second Coming”; had predicted an event he believed would begin 50 years before the postmillennial 2000-year epoch of time, which was around 1962. Other expressions were from the Philosopher Nietzsche who declared “God is dead” even in the heydays of postmillennialism’s eschatological faith in the 1950s; and from the more scientific thinkers who also predicted our Postmodernist Age 100 years before its arrival, like German Philosopher Karl Marx when he wrote “A spectre is haunting Europe.”31 Marx’s linguistic theory is encapsulated with this quote by Franco Moretti in Dialectic of Fear: “That ‘must,’ which for Marx is a scientific prediction of the nineteenth century bourgeois culture. The literature of terror (Frankenstein and Vampires) is born precisely out of the terror of a split society, and out of the desire to heal it.”32 Yeats, who had been initiated in the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn, defied Marx’s dialectics, however; and instead returned to the Platonic and Neo-platonic ancient theories of Aeons; including Egyptian ritual,27 and symbolism such as in “The Tarot deck created by A. E. Waite, (which) had been designed for the use of members of the Hermetic Society of the Golden Dawn, of which both Waite and Pamela Coleman-Smith (who executed the emblems) were members.”33 As for the artists around the time of our generation’s Grandfathers (when Yeats wrote “Second Coming”) the Expressionist painters created “content by contradiction;”34 filmmakers were making The Golem (1920); and it seemed that around WWI, the whole world went into shock, and embraced Abstract Art. No wonder our parents’ generation invented Denny’s and loved the 1964 World’s Fair which highlighted a totally plastic “Futurama” house with atomic aeriated food in the kitchen. But for some reason, we youth were not buying into that mass-manufactured culture. I propose a few theories as to why, below; because I believe the following is what created our generation and our art: recent epigenetics and DNA scientific experiments hint that what we have ancestral memory. Once again, science is embarrassed that what tribal people like John Trudell, have said all along is true: I believe that several things came together in the 60s to create in us this return (not unlike Yeats, or the Romantics did; perhaps even instinctively, but perhaps instinct IS ancestral memory) to archaic ways of understanding, expressing and surviving our culture. I owe this theory in part to literary critics Northrup Frye’s work about Yeats, and Leslie Fiedler’s about Kesey, in Return", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634243568_cleaned.txt:13:b85674250ac2", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 1441, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634243568_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634243568", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634243568_cleaned", "chunk_index": 14, "text": "again, science is embarrassed that what tribal people like John Trudell, have said all along is true: I believe that several things came together in the 60s to create in us this return (not unlike Yeats, or the Romantics did; perhaps even instinctively, but perhaps instinct IS ancestral memory) to archaic ways of understanding, expressing and surviving our culture. I owe this theory in part to literary critics Northrup Frye’s work about Yeats, and Leslie Fiedler’s about Kesey, in Return of the Vanishing American, published in January of 1967. This new way of living was born in fertile soil, because San Francisco had always been a bit Bohemian historically, especially its Barbary Coast near North Beach, where prostitution, drug-dealing, alcohol and organized crime reigned during the turn-of-the-century. But even after it burned down in 1906 and was cleaned up, it still had something going on underground, perhaps something like an aura; a certain something that had called the Beat Poets there, even earlier than us. And in the Summer of 1967, an estimated 75,000 young people heard the same call to San Francisco and arrived enmasse. There were already an estimated 10,000 local concert goers alone at Kesey’s Trip Festival in January of 1966. It is not hard to imagine how many other people had arrived since then, nor how many were not able to come to San Francisco, but were there in “spirit” or in consciousness. Two years later, as Joni Mitchell sang, “By the time we got to Woodstock” (in 1969) “we were half a million strong.”37 I, myself, had tried to hitchhike from Klamath Falls, Oregon to San Francisco the fall of 1966 when I was 15, and not just because of my personal life. In 1966, near my early home on the Klamath and Modoc Reservation, grief had taken its full toll as the Tribe was terminated by the US Government, and the tiny neighboring reservation town of Chiloquin, where I lived when I was 4, 5, & 6, was boarded up, and the Indians at my high school were snorting Watershed, a Boot Lacquer, to get high and numb the pain. The year before, in 1965, the Native American Church was finally allowed to use its Peyote in its rituals.38 Two years before that, in 1963, three men attended one of these ancient rituals with Indians who lived in the Comstock Hills of Central California, directly East from San Francisco, and said they came out of the ceremony “totally changed.” However, even before that, in 1959, four years before the first San Franciscans went to the Comstock to partake of Peyote (and inadvertently start the Red Dog Saloon;) Ken Kesey, while attending Stanford University (after graduating from the University of Oregon) became a research subject for the CIA’s MKULTRA program, and clinically ingested peyote, psilocybin, mescaline and LSD-25.

He wrote One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest as a result, and it was released in January of 1962 to world-wide acclaim. Just two years later, after he wrote Sometimes a Great Notion, he is quoted by his Sky-Pilot friend Ken Babbs in his new unpublished book called Cronies, a Burlesque: “What happened, Ken, after you finished Notion? Were you burned out on writing?” Like Yeats, Kesey was an adept magician. And just like Kesey, who said that his writing was just one way he practiced magic,40 Yeats was known for similar sentiments. “For Yeats, magic was not so much a kind of poetry, as poetry was a kind of magic, and the object of both alike was evocation of energies and knowledge from beyond normal Consciousness.”41 The wave that Kesey rode in the sixties turned out to be a massive force for cultural change, one that washes over American society still. It has been more than fifty years since the decade dawned, and yet it still divides us, drawing a line across American society whether people know it or not. When conservatives speak of the culture war, it is the counterculture that they have in their sights. The conservative movement of the last forty years has been, in part, a generational backlash against the sixties and everything that the hippies stood for. But this movement is essentially a rearguard action attempting to recover lost ground with few prospects of success.42 Reading this is heady stuff for someone who thought our generation had failed the world because our Millennial children thought so. But then again, Rick Dodgson wrote this in 2013 when Obama was President, long before the Insurrection. We knew that the dawn of the Age of Aquarius would still bring up more darkness. We are not there yet, past all of it. Upon “furthur” reflection, the je ne sais quoi energy we felt and tried to interpret in our art in the early 60s has not really been made manifest, yet. It feels like the former period was just a beginning, to what is coming. The signal is getting stronger. More is being revealed. And, the rather psychedelic 60s and 70s New Criticism or Deconstructionist Theories, although being taught, finally, in Academia, are still being fought by Professors in English on College Campuses.

Communication and Cinema Studies, Creative Writing and Contemporary Literary Theory professors saved us. I believe it is the dysfunctional, dyslexic, and/or poetic mind that can create 3D worlds in art, film, and literature. And can also understand theories, sometimes, because they too, seem to be created and understood in the third dimension. Ken Kesey was not Postmodernist at all, but a Meta-modernist45 (as Seth Abrahamson coined the phrase) an artist who heard the calling of the future age, and was able to express it by returning to Archaic modes of representation in his literature, using them in One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest and Sometimes a Great Notion; those very modes of representation that Literary Critic Leslie Fiedler found, which was the gestalt of the archaic psychedelics informing American Indian consciousness in his groundbreaking book, The Return of the Vanishing American. Kesey’s books were coined “The New (Psychedelic) Western” by Fiedler, and not only did they create the “New Western Film” (Walter Hill said all of his movies were westerns, including Aliens) but they created a new culture that embraced the return of the vanishing American Indian’s ways, some of which were contemporary tribal traditions such as circular time, community, and some more archaic, such as a reverence for Nature; including Her medicinal properties, and the mold and plant-based sacred ritual. The biculturality Kesey was exposed to in Oregon, his familial Oklahoma heritage, and his experiences with the local natives here were the perfect storm of elements to unpack this return to the past for us to get “back to the future.” Like Ken’s favorite author Zane Grey who wrote The Vanishing American as one of the first indictments ever against Christian colonialism, and influenced Hollywood in the early 1920s, Kesey and his bicultural New (American Indian) Western One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest influenced the Haight/Ashbury scene, the “New Cinema,” the “New Hollywood,” the “New Politics,” the “Sexual Revolution,” “Environmentalism,” “Feminism,” “Activism,” and even literary theory through his involvement; and he inspired the underground shadows of Poetic Cinema during the 60s and 70s, including the Beat poets, who influenced experimental filmmaker Stan Brakhage. Brakhage’s close friend from CU Boulder, Professor Peter Michaelson’s4 6 groundbreaking books The Aesthetics of Pornography (1971) and A Poetics of Obscenity (1964) have all helped to create an academic language to unpack our Cinematic trajectory through history.

I am grateful for the help of Dale Kesey, and especially my Prankster Partner Mike Hagen, (with whom I celebrated our 51-year Anniversary of being friends and filmmakers) to understand this, and also by my “Getting On The Bus,” July 8th, 1969 at The U of O EMU. None of this would have been possible, either, without the prayers from my Nez Perce family, nor the encouraging support from Professors Alilunas, Rust, Bohls, Hatfield, Sayre & Pyle. In the famous image of the den, wherein mankind are the chained prisoners, with their eyes fixed upon the shadows of reality, Plato reminds us that even were our eyes opened to the upper world the light of reality would sear our vision. All that we can hope for is such intimations of the truth as we can gather from the allegory of nature.48 And that was true, some of us became blinded looking at the sun and stars, but most of us turned to “the allegory of nature,”49 for these “intimations of the truth.”50 And we found them in the building blocks of the Universe under a Microscope. As Plato also predicted, we Truth Tellers were threatening to our parents, teachers and society. So, instead, we sought to find solace in each other. But until we found each other, which back then was not so easy, our desire to know this archetype pressing against us had us making poetry and images. Because through our art, much like Richard Dreyfuss in Close Encounters of the Third Kind, who compulsively builds a “Mashed Potatoes Mountain”; our desire to know and express what we were experiencing first took shape. Imagine my surprise 42 years later in 2005; when the drawing seemed to be an exact replication of a Commemoration Ceremony and Repatriation of Bones (bones held in the Smithsonian for over 100 years) at the Bear Paw battlefield where Chief Joseph surrendered in 1877; with the native women wearing scarves, squatting, clasping their knees, and keening, against a backdrop of the pyramid-shaped Bear Paw mountains. When I first saw these mountains, while driving my best friend Etta Conner (Great-grand niece of Chief Joseph and great granddaughter of his brother, Alikut, who was killed there at Bear Paw) to our ceremony; I started weeping so hard I couldn’t drive, and had to pull over. “Tacs, maii wee, la-ti-wah” she said. “You have been here before.” As you look at", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634243568_cleaned.txt:17:3ed012c4955c", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 1445, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634243568_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634243568", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634243568_cleaned", "chunk_index": 18, "text": "wearing scarves, squatting, clasping their knees, and keening, against a backdrop of the pyramid-shaped Bear Paw mountains.

Before that, I had traveled from the Wallowas in Oregon to Big Hole, Montana several times, teaching my kids that the 1700-mile-long Lewis and Clark trail was really the Nez Perce Trail. My partner in my screenplays, Hoyt Axton, lived near there outside of Missoula, Montana. My husband had worked on Return to Lonesome Dove in Billings and Don’t Come Knocking in Butte. But somehow, I could never seem to make myself go to Bear Paw. Perhaps it was because of what I experienced at Big Hole, another atrocious and murderous Battle site. Whatever I had experienced there was now being replicated and amplified at Bear Paw and was not a coincidence. They say that 3 is the lowest denominator of a pattern and is not a coincidence. These three powerful landscaped-based emotional reactions I had, first began when I heard that some of the Chief Joseph’s Wallowa Band Elders held a ceremony in the 1990s to call their “lost children” home. I ended up in Wallowa County in 1990 for the very first time not really knowing why I was there, except possibly because in 1984 Ken Babbs and Ken Kesey had written a screenplay called “Last Go ‘Round.” On Feb. 22nd, 1990; I was down from Bainbridge Island, hiking on Mt. Pisgah close to Kesey’s house, when “a voice” told me to call my old friend Mike Hagen. My rational mind asked why? After four years of being sober, I hadn’t been on the bus, really. Besides, I doubted he had the same phone number that I had memorized years ago, and I even doubted he would be home. But when I used the pay phone at Mt. Pisgah, I found that Mikey did have the same number, and he was at home. And he told me about this screenplay idea he had brought Ken from his hometown of Pendleton; but it had been languishing on the shelf for six years. I asked if I could help to get it made. So, of course I would end up", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634243568_cleaned.txt:18:61d802836f4b", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 1446, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634243568_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634243568", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634243568_cleaned", "chunk_index": 19, "text": "memorized years ago, and I even doubted he would be home.

So, of course I would end up in the Wallowas, later in 1990. Because that was where Jackson Sundown was from. And if you are Indigenous, and want to know about someone, you know that where they are from is everything you need to know. I picked up the screenplay from Hagen later than afternoon and read it. When I read it, I realized that Ken Kesey was not just a magician but a Literary Shaman.51 Kesey said that his writing “was just one way he practiced magic.”52 Ken’s close cousin Dale Kesey53 said that as a child Ken was also fascinated with hypnosis, too; and once hypnotized his brother Chuck. It scared everybody, but evidently Chuck came out of it, because the brothers then used it to entertain themselves by scaring their cousins with the act. For instance, Ken would “hypnotize” Chuck into a Bear, who would roar on its hind legs and chase Dale under his bed. Ken was also a Ventriloquist, and had quite an act with his dummy. These two things remind me of Rod Serlings early Twilight T.V. shows from our childhood. One segment of the show I particularly remember was about a girl who hid under her bed, where a “4th wall” opened to another dimension. All of these stories contributed to thinking about that “other world” that we were all captivated by, these stories that our parents’ good old logic, science and reason could never explain. So we were fascinated and wanted to find out for ourselves. know that Ken had turned the TV sound off, and was playing the audio from the week before. Dale said his timing was perfect, the commercials all lined up from the tape with the show, and the character’s voices were the same, except it wasn’t the same show. I imagine that twisted some young minds! Kesey’s love for Westerns never left him. According to Steven L. Tanner in his article “The Western American Context of One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest” (from a Harold Bloom Edition of Ken Kesey’s One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest): The widow of Ernest Haycox hired him while he was at the University of Oregon to write plot summaries of her husband’s novels. Haycox, a major figure in the genre, appeared in Collier’s alone an average of thirteen times a year between 1931 and 1949 and did much to shape the nation’s conception of the Western hero.” Ernest", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634243568_cleaned.txt:19:b318a87a4850", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 1447, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634243568_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634243568", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634243568_cleaned", "chunk_index": 20, "text": "Context of One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest” (from a Harold Bloom Edition of Ken Kesey’s One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest): The widow of Ernest Haycox hired him while he was at the University of Oregon to write plot summaries of her husband’s novels. Haycox, a major figure in the genre, appeared in Collier’s alone an average of thirteen times a year between 1931 and 1949 and did much to shape the nation’s conception of the Western hero.” Ernest Haycox, a Eugene, Oregon man, had a big movie made out of at least one of them: Stagecoach: The most noted of Haycox’s stories, “Stage to Lordsburg” (Collier’s, April 1937), became the basis of the landmark Western film Stagecoach (1939), directed by John Ford and starring John Wayne and Thomas Mitchell.54 This is the missing link I think, to Ken’s bicultural vision, and to what I always thought, which is that being a novel writer was secondary to Ken. He majored in Speech and Communications at the U of O, wrote several screenplays, and bummed around Hollywood in the summers when school got out. It was after these summers failed to grant him any opportunities as an actor or screenplay writer that he switched his major to Creative Writing at the U of O under the tutelage of James Hall, who was known to grade his class based on creativity rather than the problematic spelling and grammar, something Ken, Stephen J. Cannell and I all struggled with and had in common. The story that his cousin Dale told me about that first summer in college, was about how Ken came down to stay with them while Dale’s Dad was trying to break into the country-western-music-band-as-entertainment market; was amazing to hear. As Dale said, Ken was an old hand at acting in his Dad’s Dairy TV Commercials with his brother; so of course he would explore that aspect of his performance skills. Dale said that Ken also stayed at Dennis Hopper’s house once.55 This was all between 1954 and 1957, when Ken graduated from the U of O. “During his years in Eugene, he was a minor campus celebrity, an athlete, and an accomplished actor. In that time span, Kesey also came under the influence of the first of a series of prominent writer-teachers, James B. Hall. By 1958, when he entered Stanford University as a writing student, Kesey had completed a decent body of writing: short stories, one-act plays, poetry, and an unpublished novel about college athletics, End of Autumn.”56 There is so much written about what happened next, from scholars more knowledge-able than I. However, as someone who had attended the U of O and knew him, his family, including his nephews, and his Grandmother Ophelia; there are a few things I would like to clarify. One was that James B. Hall, a prestigious professor at the U of", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634243568_cleaned.txt:20:d99a2c43c2ae", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 1448, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634243568_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634243568", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634243568_cleaned", "chunk_index": 21, "text": "a decent body of writing: short stories, one-act plays, poetry, and an unpublished novel about college athletics, End of Autumn.”56 There is so much written about what happened next, from scholars more knowledge-able than I.

Hall, a prestigious professor at the U of O who taught Creative Writing, was the one who actually entered Ken’s “creative” written work for consideration in the prestigious Woodrow Wilson Fellowship; but because Ken’s degree was in Speech and Communications, he could not pursue a Master’s degree in English Literature at Stanford. Instead, I heard that he only got to audit the writing program at first, but tried especially hard to get into it when Wallace Stegner was away on Sabbatical. As Steven Tanner seems to identify below, the goal here is to fill in the blanks of this great body of academic scholarship by perhaps contributing to the following: “…and it is likely that recent ecological approaches to literary criticism will further delineate relationships between the (Cuckoo’s Nest) book’s themes and methods and Kesey’s environmentally shaped values and frames of reference.”57 It is exactly this “environmentally shaped values and frames of reference” from where Kesey and I are from, a truly bicultural space; that makes us bicultural people. And what makes us bicultural is living on stolen Indian Land. I would also like to contribute to Tanner’s idea by adding some anecdotal experiences I had with Ken over the ³⁰⁺ years I knew him. When Tanner quotes Peter O. Whitmer in his Saturday Review article called “Ken Kesey’s Search for the American Frontier,” it rang a lot of bicultural bells: “Later in the same interview, when asked what interested him about himself, he said. “It’s ‘Why me?’ What is it about me, my family, my father, this part of the country that caused it to be me who wrote Cuckoo’s Nest? It is not something I set out to do. It’s as though all the angels got together and said, ‘Okay, here’s the message that America desperately needs. Now, let’s pick him to do it.’”58 Tanner’s quote helps point us to those “ecological approaches to literary criticism,” and especially Kesey’s environmentally shaped values and frames of reference that I hope to illuminate. One approach is the new DNA memory research in Neuroscience, which is pointing to mine and Kesey’s inherited gene pool, that for Kesey may have also included Cherokee DNA. Some tribes believe that story is sacred and choses whom it wants to tell the story. Ken sensed this in the quote. When he mentions his father, I think of his Grandfather, too. It also is fascinating that Jack Kerouac picked up on this as well", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634243568_cleaned.txt:21:dfcc9292ecd1", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 1449, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634243568_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634243568", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634243568_cleaned", "chunk_index": 22, "text": "that I hope to illuminate.

It also is fascinating that Jack Kerouac picked up on this as well in this quote from Tanner: What did Kerouac think of Cuckoo’s Nest? In the Kesey Collection is a letter from Kerouac to Tom Ginsberg at Viking written October 19, 1961. Kerouac, who had read an advance copy of the novel, praises it highly but, perhaps because of his own autobiographical approach to writing, is convinced that the author must be the Columbia Gorge Indian himself, who used “Kesey,” perhaps his wife’s name, to avoid being identified with the “deafmute” hero. He says the author is certainly right about the Combine and praises the way he captures the American lingo. Kerouac even senses the flavor of “real western Indian talk” in the narration…59 Like Kesey, I am bicultural, a child with Grandparents from Oklahoma. However, I was living on an American Indian Reservation in Southern Oregon; not even knowing (except for vague hints from her) about my heritage until my Great Aunt died, the last keeper of the secret. My Grandmother was the Klamath Falls City Treasurer for 10 years, and would never have been hired if they knew she was even “part” Indian. We were not Klamath or Modoc, our heritage came from her family from Oklahoma. Turns out Kesey’s heritage is last traced back to Oklahoma as well. Keeping mixed-race secret was a survival tactic whenever possible. There are truly a lot of us “lost children.” But genetic DNA is like Blood Quantum. It is not the definition of “belonging” to most tribes. However, DNA memory may be if it is tied to Landscape, because landscape is tied to language. And language is tied to culture, but it is only a beginning. The true bicultural is one who grew up with two cultures, sometimes as a minority in a dominant one; but no matter how minor the culture is, it still creates a liminality in the person. Biculturality is like the minority heritage being like the Gulf Stream in the dominant Atlantic Ocean of your dominant cultural heritage. The two don’t mix, like oil and water. Here is a quote about it from Wikipedia. I will go into more depth about this concept later in the book, but here is a good place to start: In regards to bicultural identity, an individual may face conflict assimilating into both cultures or finding a balance between both.

An individual may face challenges assimilating into the whole, collective culture. Similarly, an individual may face difficulty balancing their identity within themselves due to the influence of both of their cultures. Being an individual with identity plurality can be hard mentally and emotionally. The different levels of biculturalism can be defined though the way people are able to simultaneously manage their two selves. The more they alternate between them, the more cognitive complexity they face, since they avoid cultural duality and do not practice handling both cultures at the same time. It is through identity integration that they will be able to solve the problem and alleviate the tolls that come with identity plurality. Bicultural identity also may have positive effects on the individual, in terms of the additional knowledge they acquire from belonging to more than one culture. Furthermore, with the growing number of racial minorities in American society, individuals that identify with more than one culture may have more linguistic ability.60 According to Dale Kesey, their mutual Grandfather would be the father of Fred Kesey, Ken’s father and Dale’s father, Grandpa Paul. “Grandfather Kesey looked very, very Indian. My brother Jimmy is looking into our heritage.”55 This “looking into our heritage” is so common now, but because of the hegemony of white supremacy, so many of our ancestors hid their heritage to survive. There are millions of us who are bicultural without even knowing it. Wilma Mankiller, Principle chief of the Cherokee Tribe from 1985-1995 stated, “An Indian is an Indian even if they have only one drop of Indian blood;”61 In response to this quote, the internet is alive with agreement: And I say to you, my Indo-mestizo brothers and sisters in North, Central, and South America: Recognize your other half. Embrace your Indian heritage. Explore your roots and never forget who came before you. Because we are more in number than what we think. We are 96 millions of federally recognized Indians in the Americas, but we are 500 millions of Indians of all mixed-back-grounds. We let labels wipe the Indian out of us. We let ignorance thrive and let discrimination surround us. We let white-mestizo and Euro society construct our identity and marginalize us in census boxes. We let media depict our Indian brothers and sisters as poor and illiterate when the truth is that some of us are talented and strong.62 This also applies to Steven Tanner’s “ecological approaches to literary criticism,” because the very ecology of our", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634243568_cleaned.txt:23:755453455a8f", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 1451, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634243568_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634243568", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634243568_cleaned", "chunk_index": 24, "text": "of Indians of all mixed-back-grounds.

We let media depict our Indian brothers and sisters as poor and illiterate when the truth is that some of us are talented and strong.62 This also applies to Steven Tanner’s “ecological approaches to literary criticism,” because the very ecology of our bicultural Oregon encodes and informs several things: One, our Oregon sense of humor is indigenous. I go into this in great detail in my last book: Echoes From the Set: 50 Years of Filming on Location Hollywood and Oregon’s Cinematic Literary Voices. 63 The thing is, all of our native voices are also poetic and/or metaphoric, which is also present in our American Indian sense of humor. You may notice I rarely use “Native American.” I am with Russell Means, a famous American Indian Movement leader and actor, who once told me that “everyone who is born on American soil is Native.” The distinction he said, was that HE was an “American Indian,” an Indios (In God) that the Creator placed on the earth to live where He wanted them to live and grow. I have given up on trying to explain this as well, that the Earth is our mother, like Oregon’s own Chief Joseph tried. National Poet Laureate Joy Harjo even states her agreement with this in her introduction to Reinventing the Enemy’s Language. 64 But Native Oregonians get it. We have learned from the First people here to be environmentalists. Oregon has led the way in Environmentalism because Oregon is very bicultural. Two, our understanding of the mythology about the Indigenous Coyote, the trickster, is that he really is a kind of prankster. Like the Merry Pranksters, from whom I’ve learned to laugh at myself. I even feel as if God is a Prankster sometimes with a great sense of humor, in dealing with me. Three, the landscape of Oregon invokes a religion close to pastoralism. My mother’s side of the family came to Oregon in 1849, and our 1870 family farm is still out River Road. The ecology of Oregon that encodes and informs us is this: Pioneer stock learned from the local Indians that collaboration is key to survival. And I don’t mean just Barn Raising. I mean the consciousness of collaboration is paramount in us everywhere we turn. When Kesey stepped into the Bay Area in the late 50s, he brought that bicultural ethic with him. I don’t think it is a coincidence that the 60s were very tribal. And I don’t think it’s a coincidence that certain 60s literary theories in the New Criticism seem very psychedelic to me, in that Jacques Derrida, de Man and de Bolla also have a certain 60s", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634243568_cleaned.txt:24:8fb5761ccad9", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 1452, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634243568_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634243568", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634243568_cleaned", "chunk_index": 25, "text": "Raising.

And I don’t think it’s a coincidence that certain 60s literary theories in the New Criticism seem very psychedelic to me, in that Jacques Derrida, de Man and de Bolla also have a certain 60s ecology to their theories, nor a coincidence that bi-culturalism has become their hot topic since the 90s. The first of these theories is what Hannah Arendt called Derrida’s ‘Marrano Metaphor’65 idea of biculturality. Applied to similar situations, (the Jewish people forced to adhere to a Christian religion in the 1400s in Spain) such as The American Indian was forced to adhere to a Christian Religion in America, has created a bizarre after-effect, and that is called a “bicultural writing between the lines.” These views on biculturality are from articles attained through the Knight Library, well cited, and published online; and edited by Agata Bielik-Robson as explained here: …the Marrano strategy offers an alternative practice of universalization, conceived as an ‘after-Babel project’ to mend the broken whole from within, horizontally, without assuming the lofty abstract position of a general meta-language, but through the effort of bi- or multi-linguality, and also without overstressing the catastrophic nature of the Babelian dispersion of tongues.66 In my research on the “Marrano” I first found Derrida’s and then Levinas’ theories on it; but then I found Walter Benjamin’s, and he made me feel at home with it. And it was here, with author Daniel Weiss, Faculty of Divinity at Cambridge, is where I found the same words I have always called my “duality of culture,” but what my professors have called my “Between -the-lines” writing:67 According to Leo Strauss, writers like Baruch Spinoza resorted to secrecy and concealed-ness primarily because of fear: they avoided the issue of “coming out” due to the anxiety of persecution, caused by the discrepancy between their radical views and the opinion of the masses, still entrenched in their fixed cultural identities. They were, therefore, forced to convey their messages “in between the lines” to connect with those in the similar position, capable of immediately recognizing the “secret message” (Strauss, 1988).68 That “ventriloquist specter” of the third quote was Ken Kesey. The quote in the second was my Grandmother and me: “due to the anxiety of persecution, caused by the discrepancy between their radical views and the opinion of the masses, still entrenched in their fixed cultural identities.” We spoke the same language. He spoke in metaphor and I spoke in images, both are very cinematic. But what they are together is Poetic Cinema. And THAT is what this book is really about.

But before we go there, just mention Derrida, and I think of de Man and de Bolla, all whom are relevant to Kesey’s novel, for instance, de Man’s use of the term subversive here: Mere reading, it turns out, prior to any theory, is able to transform critical discourse in a manner that would appear deeply subversive to those who think of the teaching of literature as a substitute for the teaching of theology, ethics, psychology, or intellectual history. Close reading accomplishes this often in spite of itself because it cannot fail to respond to structures of language which it is the more or less secret aim of literary teaching to keep hidden.70 It is precisely those “structures of language,” and Raymond Williams’ “…structure of feeling “71 that spoke to me with regards to Ken. But especially this from Benveniste, who, “…essentially posits that the word, aka language, is not “just the very definition of man” but preceded man and preceded his thinking.”72 Essentially, “In the beginning was the WORD, and the Word was God.”73 If this isn’t psychedelic literary theory, I don’t know what is! Which of course brings us to a related anecdotal story about Kesey, one that only those of us there at the farm that April day in 1983 would know. It was the funeral of not one but two of our closest filmmaker friends who had died within days of each other. Kesey asked Ken Babbs, his best friend since Stanford, to read Percy Blythe Shelley’s Ode to the West Wind. Suddenly, as Babbs read it as only a brilliant poet himself could read Shelley, the beautiful Spring day sky turned dark as a grave, and a terrible West Wind blew up strong like a miniature hurricane. We all looked at Babbs and Kesey because we all knew that this was not a coincidence, that they had summoned the West Wind with Shelley’s WORDS. The very second Babbs had finished reading the following stanza, the skies turned blue again and the wind died down: Drive my dead thoughts over the universe Like wither’d leaves to quicken a new birth! And, by the incantation of this verse, Scatter, as from an unextinguish’d hearth Ashes and sparks, my words among mankind! Be through my lips to unawaken’d earth The trumpet of a prophecy! O Wind, If Winter comes, can Spring be far behind?”74 All of these theories are very subversive, but so was Kesey.

O Wind, If Winter comes, can Spring be far behind?”74 All of these theories are very subversive, but so was Kesey. Does anyone think it is a coincidence that Kirk Douglas and Michael Douglas BOTH wanted the Director of One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest to be none other than Milos Forman, who had recently come to America and was one of the most subversive directors to ever come out of Russian-occupied Czechoslovakia? There is no such thing as coincidence. Just look at this text written by Kesey, in which he capitalizes the word WORD, and makes it sound as if Randle P. himself is God: Cuckoo’s Nest is not a Messianic Metaphor however; it’s a bicultural “New Age Western,” as Poetic Cinema filmmaker Kelly Reichardt calls her own film genre for her Meek’s Cutoff. But Ken Kesey’s was the very, very first; and John Barth, with Sot Weed Factor came very close. Dear Ladies and Gentlemen of the Jury, I present my literary theory defense herewith, starting with another quote from Kesey himself from his book, about the Hero, in One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest (‘62); but remember that even though the description of McMurphy sounds John Wayne-ish, in the end the character is an Anti-Hero who treats everyone that is marginalized with respect, challenges authority, gets turned upon and murdered, and does NOT ride into the Sunset: Drawing upon popular culture, Kesey links McMurphy with the most familiar hero of the frontier – the cowboy. He smokes Marlboro cigarettes and is described as “the cowboy out of the TV set walking down the middle of the street to meet a dare” (CN, 172). He has a “drawling cowboy actor’s voice” (CN, 232). Before his first meeting with Harding, he says, “this hospital ain’t big enough for the two of us… Tell this Harding that he either meets me man to man or he’s a yaller skunk and better be outta town by sunset” (CN, 24). He has a “cowboy bluster” and a “TV-cowboy stoicism” (CN, 62, 73). He sings cowboy songs in the latrine and has Wild Bill Hickok’s “dead-man’s hand” tattooed on his shoulder (CN, 83, 77). Just before he assaults Big Nurse he hitches up his shorts “like they were horsehide chaps, and pushes his cap with one finger like it was a ten-gallon Stetson” Harding refers to him with an allusion to the Lone Ranger: “I’d like to stand there at the window with a silver bullet in my hand and ask ‘who wawz that ’er masked", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634243568_cleaned.txt:27:34ff19909a2e", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 1455, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634243568_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634243568", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634243568_cleaned", "chunk_index": 28, "text": "songs in the latrine and has Wild Bill Hickok’s “dead-man’s hand” tattooed on his shoulder (CN, 83, 77).

Could Cuckoo’s Nest be the new mythology of the American Cowboy? Could that voice be bicultural and the voice of the future, in addition to being the Oregon Literary Cinematic Voice? As if in answer, I found this revelation of a quote as if it was a resounding yes in a Thesis by Matthew W. Driscoll, called Ken Kesey and Literary Shamanism: I have to add Oregon, Washington, and Alaska to the remaining American frontiers in the twentieth century, but even these frontier lands will be corrupted and exploited during Kesey’s lifetime. According to Kesey though, hope remains. Frontier landscapes remind and inspire characters in his novels that there are alternatives to lifestyles based on materialism, consumerism, and cultural conformity. Integrating his personal experiences – his childhood in the Oregon wilderness and the model of manhood provided by his father – Kesey sees the independent and physically vital American Western man as the defender of a sense of individuality that is forfeited when man succumbs to the rule of “the inhuman part of American industrialism” (Kesey qtd. in Plimpton 224)77 He goes on later to quote Literary Critic Leslie Fiedler, who was, by the way, on the Woodrow Wilson scholarship committee; therefore also directly responsible for Kesey’s getting a grant to Stanford Grad school; therefore even for his ability to write One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest, while there with Ken Babbs: As a young writer in the Sixties, facing the omnipotent influence of American capitalism and its many educational, financial, and cultural institutions, Kesey integrates the individuality of the cowboy into his recovery of shamanism through fiction. Thus, his homeland in Oregon, a place that Leslie Fiedler calls “one of our last actual Wests,” (pg. 177) is integral in understanding what drives Kesey to design a number of his characters based upon the mythologized American cowboy. The cowboys that he incorporates into his fiction are not those of traditional American Western tales like Owen Wister’s The Virginian. Kesey’s cowboys pertain to a genre specific to the latter half of the twentieth century that Leslie Fiedler, a critic of literature from or about the American West defines as the “New Western” in The Return of the Vanishing American.78 I was fascinated by this book, and it made me wonder if Leslie Fiedler was a bicultural and how he can hear this", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634243568_cleaned.txt:28:42854da47fcb", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 1456, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634243568_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634243568", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634243568_cleaned", "chunk_index": 29, "text": "incorporates into his fiction are not those of traditional American Western tales like Owen Wister’s The Virginian.

Recently, I learned he was adopted by the Blackfeet, so that makes sense. He is cited by an incredible academic writer named M. Elise Marubbio, who is the writer of the article: “The Emergence of the Indian Maiden” in her Journal titled Killing the Indian Maiden: Images of Native Women in Film. And speaking of Academic writers, there are rumors that the head of the Stanford Graduate Writing program, Wallace Stegner, was not a fan of Ken’s writing. And neither was top literary critic, Harold Bloom. However, before he passed away in 2019, Bloom published many other literary critic’s push-backs to his position, and they were fascinatingly adept. Perhaps that was because Fiedler had published The Return of the Vanishing American in the interim, amazingly enough published in 1968, and written during 1967 and The Summer of Love. Our source for this quote, Driscoll, continues: Fiedler’s vanishing Frontier continues to be explored throughout the twentieth century, to the point that scarcely a Frontier or wilderness remains. According to Fiedler, rather than being nostalgic about the changing nature of the West, the New Western is psychedelic: “But no other name fits as well as the New Western, which, like the Old Western at its most authentic, deals precisely with the alteration of consciousness. Besides, many of the so-called ‘psychedelics’ themselves, those hallucinogenic drugs, at least, found in nature rather than synthesized in the laboratory (marijuana, peyote, the Mexican Mushroom, Ayahuasca, etc.) are our bridge to – even as they are gifts from – the world of the Indian: the world not of an historical past, but of an eternally archaic one.79 This novel, called One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest, created not just an “alteration of consciousness” like the “New Age Western” such as Meeks Cutoff’s Director Reichardt said, but was a Shamanic “Psychedelic Western;” that revealed the first glimmerings of change in the New Age, period. Because of Kesey’s book, in 1962, the world changed. The world was waiting to change. We were listening for a voice, listening for The Word. And it came. As a bicultural word.

We were all following him, too, then. We also heard, in a way that we could understand, that the world was an insane asylum. We were in Plato’s Cave and we needed to see Truth and Beauty like Shelley and Yeats and Plato saw Beauty and Truth. We started to dress like these Romantic Poets. A few San Franciscans went to the Comstock to seek a better way with the Native American Church and Sacred Peyote. These San Franciscans were the ones that the Indians of “8th Hopi Prophesy” predicted.80 They started to wear 18th Century Western Wear, or were already wearing headbands and beads and moccasins as a sign of solidarity and respect. They opened the Red Dog Saloon right straight across the California border in Nevada, and The Charlatans started to play there. They used psychedelics to tune in on this new consciousness, and started to play a signature Psychedelic Sound. Big Brother and the Holding Company (before Janis Joplin) came and took it to a new level. Then they took it all back to San Francisco and started holding dances in the Fillmore District while Kesey started Acid Trips with the Grateful Dead. At one point, instead of competing, they merged. The master voice joined in the symphony and soon millions of us joined them. This use of psychedelics ushered in a Brave New World: “Once they were back in San Francisco, the Family Dog couldn’t wait to replicate the experience,” as the founder of Family Dog, Luria Castell Dickson says “With LSD, we experienced what it took Tibetan monks 20 years to obtain, yet we got there in 20 minutes. We had to, to save the world.”81 Like the Old Western, the New Western brought with it “an Archaicness” including “’archaic Just like Yeats’ “Gyres of Time” based on Plato’s Aeons, we saw the world on the brink of destruction, and we took it back; at first, 200 years, and in 2020 we are taking it back 2000 years, while we move it again forward to the New Age of Aquarius.

Quantum Mechanics is our new These shadows of the underground were the foundation of the Sixties, and it is this author’s hope to see with new eyes the Cinema of the following 10 years, the New Hollywood, beginning with Stan Brakhage, who called Eugene, Oregon “the Poetic Cinema Capitol of the World.” Brakhage made this statement after Ron Finne screened How Old Is the Water. Brakhage was presenting one of his films at 150 Science at the UO. Campus film groups showed movies there, and my husband Philip’s sister Marilyn used to invite him there with her. Philip says he will never forget seeing these films together. This was probably around 1967, as Marilyn and Philip went to Europe soon after. Coincidently, 1967 was the year Kesey returned to Oregon and became a filmmaker, and I had returned to the pastoral Danish farm of my ancestors, outside of Eugene, away from the violent Indian Reservation. It was to become the best of the beginning of times that are still finding its way to us through the “widening gyre” of both heaven and hell. People keep asking me: “Are our times now like the 60’s? I answer, the 60’s on LSD was not as psychedelic as these times we are living through right now in this pandemic ridden, polarized, racist and politically offensive election year. But yeah, it’s similar. According to his understanding of the Golden Dawn Hermetic theory, Yeats’ Gyres are like a “Second Coming,” and happen when the “Old Age” of history is in its death-throes, and the New Age gyre, usually a new age of Spirituality, is being born. Sound Familiar? The former Piscean Age, (Fisher of Men, Fisher King Mythology) is dying. The Age of Aquarius Constellation, an (androgynous?) woman pouring out blessings from an Alabaster jar, began as flashes of revelations some 50 years ago, and I believe that the advent of the 60s San Francisco tribe was the true herald of that new Aeon of Aquarius. Yeats, however, in his poem was worried about the vision he saw as symbolic of the New Age, from “Spiritus Mundi” (The Universal Mind) ; one that he likened to the Sphinx, like a Dragon or a Thunderbird or other form of “rough beast” from the past. He foresaw this equivalent crawling “with slow thighs” to Bethlehem to birth the new age (like the old Piscean Age was 2000 years prior) but this time by the Sphinx.82 He wrote this after he saw the world’s first", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634243568_cleaned.txt:31:0ca9c1fbe2a1", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 1459, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634243568_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634243568", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634243568_cleaned", "chunk_index": 32, "text": "worried about the vision he saw as symbolic of the New Age, from “Spiritus Mundi” (The Universal Mind) ; one that he likened to the Sphinx, like a Dragon or a Thunderbird or other form of “rough beast” from the past.

Ad infinitum. These Gyres are like Constellations that rule these 2000-year-long Aeons, which is what Plato called them, which are essentially intelligent emanations from the Universe. “In a note to the Cuala Press edition of Michael Robartes and the Dancer, Yeats describes in detail this historical process as it is symbolized in his double gyre: This … is true also of history, for the end of an age, which always receives the revelation of the character of the next age, is represented by the coming of one gyre to its place of greatest expansion and of the other to that of its greatest contraction. At the present moment the life gyre is sweeping outward, unlike that before the birth of Christ which was narrowing, and has almost reached its greatest expansion. The revelation which approaches will however take its character from the contrary movement of the interior gyre. All our scientific, democratic, fact-accumulating heterogeneous civilization belongs to the outward gyre and prepares not the continuance of itself but the revelation as in a lightning flash, though in a flash that will not strike only in one place, and will for a time be constantly repeated, of the civilization that must slowly take its place. This is too simple a statement, for much detail is possible.84 Without Northrup Frye, we may never have known what it meant, either. Northrup Frye had “gained international fame with … Anatomy of Criticism (1957), one of the most important works of literary theory published in the twentieth century. The American critic Harold Bloom commented at the time of its publication that Anatomy established Frye as “the foremost living student of Western literature.”85 He had also deciphered William Blakes’s poems, and while embracing the “New Criticism” we discussed in Chapter 1, had also cautioned that we also needed a new “Archetypal Criticism” as a “New Poetics,” which I also tried to address earlier in Chapter 1, in “The Archetype of the 60s.” But why am I doing this?

Because our world is truly in need of Archetypal criticism as “a new poetics.” Here’s one reason why: Frye was very interested in the Student Protests and the Counterculture according to the list of topics he was interviewed for. Mythology: Timeless Tales of Gods and Heroes by Edith Hamilton87 was a huge influence on us in English Classes at the University of Oregon in the late sixties. I still have my copy. That is, the study of recurring structural patterns grants students an emancipatory distance from their own society, and gives them a vision of a higher human state – the Longinian sublime – that is not accessible directly through their own experience, but ultimately transforms and expands their experience, so that the poetic model becomes a model to live by. 88 In what he terms a “kerygmatic mode,” myths become “myths to live by” and “metaphors to live in,” which “(…) not only work for us but constantly expand our horizons, [so that] we may enter the world of [kerygma or transformative power] and pass on to others what we have found to be true for ourselves.”89 In his spirit of passing “on to others what we have found to be true for ourselves,” I am passing on what I found to be true for myself, which is what I know from living in the 60s, being on the psychedelic bus, getting sober 35 years ago, being a filmmaker, studying under a Jungian Apprentice screenplay writer, working with quantum mechanics physicists, studying comparative religions; and throwing the I Ching and divining with The Golden Dawn Tarot Deck for 50 years. And what I know is this. Yeats’ Sphinx was a woman, not a man, because Egyptologists discovered the beard was an add-on after Yeats’ death. She is mentioned in 9500 B.C.E. so she is older than Yeats thought. She is aligned with the Constellation Leo, which supports the Aeon theory, because that was in 9500 B.C.E. (And the pyramids are aligned with Orion, the Lion Hunter.) The Star of Bethlehem’s astrological configuration was predicted by three Wise (Astrologers) Men from Egypt and the East heralding the time of Christ’s birth. Astrologers now are heralding the birth of Aquarius with the conjunction of Saturn and Jupiter on Dec. 21, 2021, with three asteroids conjugating within the conjugation, named Isis Horus and Osiris, as discovered by Alice Macdonald.90 Her aspects are peace, love, and understanding.

Carl Jung was the way-shower to this age. Synchronicity is a hallmark of it. But the Gyres are something else. Yeats was on to something. And boy, his poem rings so true for today. The 60s are just getting started. All of us see what is happening today as a direct correlation with our burgeoning Aeon. But it’s going to be all right. No, it’s going to be better than all right. It is going to be another Renaissance. Even better than the last. As the Gyres go full circle through space and time, there is a returning. And it is now. …The human soul is always moving outward into the objective world or inward into itself; and this movement is double because the human soul would not be conscious were it not suspended between contraries, the greater the contrast the more intense the consciousness. The man, in whom the movement inward is stronger than the movement outward, the man who sees all reflected within himself, the subjective man, reaches the narrow end of a gyre at death, for death is always, they contend, even when it seems the result of accident, preceded by an intensification of the subjective life; and has a monument of revelation immediately after death, a revelation which they describe as his being carried into the presence of all his dead kindred, a moment whose objectivity is exactly equal to the subjectivity of death. The objective man on the other hand, whose gyre moves outward, receives at this moment the revelation, not of himself seen from within, for that is impossible to objective man, but of himself as if he were somebody else.91 I think it is important to include this because it also gives us understanding of the Gyre we are leaving, which in essence is Piscean consciousness. But like the objective man, The Age of Pisces created “scientific objectivity” during the Age of Reason, and that is exactly what Yeats is railing against. The Age of Aquarius and Northrop Frye encourages us to return inward to symbolism and mythology just like Jung and Yeats do. And with that, we might as well bring the Father of all of our (and theirs) Philosophy, Plato back into the mix; and remember the Aeon theory which Plotinus opens this last chapter with: The “Intellectual-Principle …brings compulsion not persuasion.” Because this New Age of Consciousness, the subjective soul-searching Age of Aquarius, turned us into compulsive-like lemmings searching for that vibration, that consciousness.", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634243568_cleaned.txt:34:37a616c35904", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 1462, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634243568_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634243568", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634243568_cleaned", "chunk_index": 35, "text": "Northrop Frye encourages us to return inward to symbolism and mythology just like Jung and Yeats do.

My favorite encapsulation of how this felt, and how that feeling was out-pictured in our lives, was also in the article by New York Times best seller and book reviewer Sheila Weller for Vanity Fair, called “Suddenly That Summer:” In a 25-square-block area of San Francisco, in the summer of 1967, an ecstatic, Dionysian mini-world sprang up like a mushroom, dividing American culture into a Before and After unparalleled since World War II. If you were between 15 and 30 that year, it was almost impossible to resist the lure of that transcendent, peer-driven season of glamour, ecstasy, and Utopianism. It was billed as the Summer of Love, and its creators did not employ a single publicist or craft a media plan. Yet the phenomenon washed over America like a tidal wave … ushering in a series of liberations and awakenings that irreversibly changed our way of life.92 Except it really wasn’t that sudden. It just hit critical mass, and it had been building for quite a long time. As Dave Getz, the guitarist from Big Brother and the Holding Company said at The Red Dog Saloon Reunion, “This whole scene essentially had a Medieval, a Classical and a Baroque Era, by 1969 it was the Baroque.”93 “The Medieval” foundations were laid in the early 50s (1951) when Maya Deren, an experimental filmmaker, visited the U of O campus, The Beats hit San Francisco, and then Jack Kerouac wrote On the Road in 1957. In the late 50s another “experimental” filmmaker, Stan Brakhage, started making films in a whole new unorthodox way. My favorite quote about him is from film historians David Bordwell and Kristin Thompson: “Brakhage considered the artist as a visionary who perceives and feels more deeply than others. He sought to capture on film untutored vision, a sense of space and light unspoiled by knowledge and social training.”94 I just find this quote so poetic, because he seems to be railing against the intellect, too, like Yeats. The artist’s way of perceiving is aesthetic, based in the senses, but the tutored vision and ways of knowledge in society are scientific. Those ways got us to where we were, which was way out of balance. We needed to let the Poets and Visionaries have a voice to try to save us with a new way of seeing.

And that meant stripping and undoing and starting over, by returning to where we first went wrong, and that was the Medieval Period, which is represented as between the end of the Roman Empire, and before the Renaissance. In some circles we wish we could go back and reclaim the period when Christ’s teachings were usurped by the Church at the Council of Nicaea in 325 AD; and insist that the Gospels of Mary Magdalene and Philip had prevailed in keeping Mary as Christ’s chosen Apostle, not her brother Peter, who started the Catholic church. The trajectory of that decision resulted in women being burned at the stake and the Inquisition. And then there was The Plague. The Renaissance and Age of Discovery came after the Plague, and the world started over with new visions of what humanity could really be like. But the Doctrine of Discovery Papal Bull in 1493 would eventually cause the genocide of hundreds of millions of Indigenous people. So much for the Rational that became rationalized thinking when not connected to the heart. And what came next, the Industrial Age didn’t have one. Which in my mind is when people started going insane. Fritz Lang’s film Metropolis tried to warn us. And even our National Hero John Wayne couldn’t save us. The Western died in 1962, and even had a funeral in Hollywood’s The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance, just as a New Age hero was being born. But this hero wasn’t larger than life, wasn’t measured against doorways and Monument Valley; he was the Anti-hero, the everyman, a guy who treated insane asylum inmates as regular people; and who also caused the American Indian, relegated to the Wooden Cigar Store deaf and dumb trope, to speak and become visible. And that was in 1962, that seminal year, when One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest was published, Aquarius pierced the Veil, and now the world has not been the same since. 1962 was a seminal year for a lot of reasons: The Coffee House Folk Scene was incubating singers and players like Bob Dylan, Joan Baez, Jerry Garcia, Janis Joplin, Jorma Kaukonen, Milan Melvin and Hoyt Axton.

And as a result, the Harvard Professor is now known as Ram Das, joining the Beat Poets including Allen Ginsberg, Gary Snyder, and even Jack Kerouac into Eastern Mysticism. His name is Bhagavan Das, and he told me this story one dark night at the Belknap Hot Springs, when my dear friend (and screenplay agent at the time) Susan Grant, brought him up to see if there was a screenplay in a book he wrote titled It’s Here Now (Are You?). 95 Of course there was a screenplay there, especially after coaxing him into telling me what “the inciting incident” was that wasn’t in his book. And that inciting incident was when he had heard Hoyt Axton first sing folk songs, possibly at a Huntington Beach, California venue called The Golden Bear, then went out and bought a guitar and followed Hoyt around in 1962. And speaking of 1962 (what some called “the last normal year in America” before Kennedy was killed) was not very “cinematic” at the time. But when a man named Zapruder filmed the actual assassination of Kennedy in 1963, suddenly everyone was buying a camera, and filming with 8 or 16mm. Some were already making amazing “home movies” like Stan Brakhage. Stan was an early experimental filmmaker with ties to Eugene. And at home, in Eugene, Oregon – filmmakers were cropping up everywhere. Ron Finne met Cinematographer Haskell Wexler at the University of Oregon, and ended up as part of his film crew on a bus to film the March on Washington in 1963. South Eugene High alumni Loren Sears was filming the infamous “Diggers” in San Francisco and another famous South Eugene alumni Richard Brautigan, who was in San Francisco; and then filmed American Indians with his wife, Pat Ferraro; who later became a film instructor at San Francisco State for 30 years.

In 1964 Ken Kesey and the Merry Pranksters were following themselves around, too, with a 16mm Arriflex, but on a psychedelic bus, all the way from the West to the East Coast and back. Later, in 1966, one of my favorite films was made in Czechoslovakia, called Daisies which also seemed to just follow two young women around with a camera. By 1967, everybody was following anybody around with a camera, because the scene was so psychedelic. And what a scene that was filmed, with an incredible The Summer of Love also thrust a new kind of music – acid rock – across the airwaves, nearly put barbers out of business, traded clothes for costumes, turned psychedelic drugs into sacred door keys, and revived the outdoor gatherings of the Messianic Age, making everyone an acolyte and a priest. It turned sex with strangers into a mode of generosity, made “uptight” an epithet on a par with “racist,” refashioned the notion of earnest Peace Corps idealism into a bacchanalian rhapsody, and set that favorite American adjective, “free,” on a fresh altar.96 Our parents didn’t know what hit us, we didn’t even know what had hit us. But calling a sufficient measure of LSD for a “trip,” a “hit’, seemed appropriate, and a whole new language evolved. The energy of Creativity and LOVE was also very strong. It made us want to not just create a song, a poem or a painting, or a film, it made us want to create LIFE, but film was the only medium we knew that could capture ALL of that. Mountain Girl put it beautifully in Sheila Weller’s article: “It was this magical moment … this liberation movement, a time of sharing that was very special,” with “a lot of trust going around,” says Carolyn “Mountain Girl” Garcia, who had a baby with Ken Kesey, the man who helped kick off that season, and who then married Jerry Garcia, the man who epitomized its fruition.”97 Mountain Girl and The Grateful Dead spent a lot of time in Oregon at Kesey’s Farm, either on the road for concerts or performing in Eugene in Concert over the years.

He, Jack Smith, Stan Brakhage and Jonas Mekas were screening their Poetic Cinema films in the Haight in 1966. They must have felt the call, too. This is also after Anne and I made our giant in-roads into naming Oregon’s Literary Cinematic Voice. We named it cross-cultural, but after this event the Elders told Anne that Oregon was not Cross-Cultural, but Bicultural. Also, thanks to this presentation by Anne, the U of O also screened Oregon’s own James Blue’s films, who was the first American to win at Cannes for Olive Trees of Justice (1962) and the first Oregonian to be nominated for an Academy Award for his documentary A Few Notes On Our Food Problem (1968). This was huge feat in 1968, not even our most famous Oregon-made director James Ivory was nominated for an Academy award until 1987, almost 20 years later. I also claim James Blue as a bicultural filmmaker, who like Hoyt Axton, Kesey, and I had heritage from Oklahoma, and all whom have a bicultural voice. Dan Hicks from the Charlatans had moved to Gate 5 in Sausalito, and they all continued to lead the way, from their houseboats and farms, especially Kesey with his bus footage gathering filmmakers together, that Jack Nicholson would benefit from later in 1969. And we followed them, everywhere they went. They were indeed the “Flower Power people” whom Poet Allen Ginsberg had called together in Berkeley in 1965. The truth is, the Hippies came later, around the time of the media frenzy we call the Summer of Love in ‘67. I know that the first of these “Flower Children” were biculturals, like the Red Dog Saloon Founders, and our own friend Kemo, who initiated us with an Indian ceremony before smoking our first joint. This was on Gate 6 on The Issaquah, an old 1914 Ferry Boat from Seattle, with a “Ballroom” in the hull, and a Bathroom. Jay Wilson brought that Flower Power back to Eugene with a handful of Psychedelics, Psychedelic Posters, Vinyl Music and Bally Lo clothes (like the Beatles line) which he wears in this photograph of him in Eugene’s very first Rock-n-Roll Band, The Hammond Typewriter.

To counter war, we needed to counter Political Conservativism; which is why the father of my children, Jay Wilson, wanted to teach Political Science. To counter Colonialism we needed to counter its Cultural Genocide of Native American people, and honor and celebrate them and their culture. To counter Heteropatriarchy we needed Sexual Freedom, but to counter that we needed to counter Monotheism and Puritanical constructs that kept women prisoners; to counter that Monotheistic Patriarchy we needed Feminism; to counter war and genocide we needed to counter Capitalism; to counter earth exploitation we needed environmentalism. And last but not least, to counter racism we needed to counter White Supremacy, which were all tied together in supporting the three pillars of racism: Monotheism, Capitalism, Heteropatriarchy, War mongering, Genocide et al., fed into each other and were intertwined. It is important to me to relate this history before it is lost. If you read current Academic literature on the subject, such as Harvard Professor Philip Deloria’s recent work titled Counterculture Indians and the New Age⁹⁹ ; which he begins with an experience on a commune in 1971 as a boy; and which somehow gives him authority to essentially lump counter-culturalists, communalists and New Agers into a stereotype of cultural appropriating Hippies of Indian-ness. I counter this by trying to show in this book how the whole movement was most probably birthed in a Tribal Peyote ceremony of the Native American Church of the Comstock. I also countered this in a presentation with the simple fact that by 1971, the original Flower Child movement had been commodified by the Media. In all fairness, he highlights crucial concepts like Postmodernism and uses critical terminology such as symbolic meanings, by which “we can also witness the continued unraveling of the connections between meanings and social realities,” and “one can see the long shadows of certain strands of postmodernism: increasing reliance on texts and interpretations, runaway individualism within a rhetoric of community.” But I hope in my book to disagree with the rest of the paragraph denoting, in Deloria’s word: “the distancing of native people, and a gaping disjuncture between a cultural realm of serious play and the power dynamics of social conflict. New Age thinking tends to focus on ultimate individual liberation and engagement with a higher power, having little interest in the social world that lies between self and spirit.”100 Yeats would also counter with this: “Within this system it is pointless for the soul to seek to express itself with subjective intellectual sincerity when it is in an incarnation that requires it to explore worldly or spiritual objectivity, and similarly", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634243568_cleaned.txt:40:284c398e1456", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 1468, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634243568_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634243568", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634243568_cleaned", "chunk_index": 41, "text": "of serious play and the power dynamics of social conflict.

Perhaps he didn’t know, like Wikipedia, that “The Flower Children” were NOT Hippies. What he was too young to know was the true founders of communalism, the counterculture and the New Age in the very early 60s were truly the “Flower-Children” of San Francisco, who were very involved in creating the social programs of their counter-culture, like this one for the American Indian Well-Baby Clinic in 1967. The hippies flowing into San Francisco in 1967 weren’t embraced by everyone with open arms, and city health officials at the time thought that a clinic in the Haight would only encourage them to stay. Smith, who had never been involved in activism before, saw the suffering in his neighborhood, and inspired by other free movements like the Diggers (who served free meals) and a bit of drug experimentation of his own, decided he had to do something.103 The truth is, this generation created the greatest social changes ever known to Western Civilization since the French and American Revolutions. The postmodern crisis in America caused them to join together to embrace a new kind of multiculturalism. After all, it was this generation who went on to create solutions: “The Third World Strike at San Francisco State from November 6, 1968 until March 21, 1969 demanding that the university included histories of communities of color in their curricula to be taught by people of color. It united white students, community members and students from the Afro-American Students Union, the Asian American Political Alliance, the Mexican-American Student Confederation, and the Native American Student Organization.”104 And so it is no accident that Little Big Man started production on July 14, 1969. Hollywood wanted in on the action. That is until they were called on the red carpet by an actual Indian in the most hallowed of Hollywood Halls, the Oscars.

Hollywood wanted in on the action. That is until they were called on the red carpet by an actual Indian in the most hallowed of Hollywood Halls, the Oscars. In Making of the White Man’s Indian: Native Americans and Hollywood Movies by Angela Aleiss, the author begins her article by stating that in spite of the claims of some about her authenticity, Sasheen Littlefeather, by proxy for Marlon Brando at the Academy Awards in (March 27th) 1973, had “foisted” the country’s sins against the Native American people on their shoulders. 105 It was incredible timing given the rise of the American Indian Movement’s efforts to counter colonialism in Wounded Knee at the same time, (February 27 – May 8, 1973); in addition to their Bureau of Indian Affairs occupation in D.C. just a few months before. The Occupation of Alcatraz in the San Francisco Bay was “November 20, 1969 -June 11, 1971, a 19-month long protest led by Richard Oakes, LaNada Regarding Deloria, it’s ironic that even the Flower Children called the 75,000 mediated Hippies “tourists” when they descended there in San Francisco in 1967, and promptly left town for Marin County, until that too became overtaken; and then many of them moved to Oregon, to follow Ken Kesey. Additionally, let’s take a look at Deloria’s’ “counter communalists.” Michael Douglas was one, living on a Commune in Santa Barbara when he talked his Dad Kirk Douglas into letting him produce One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest (1975). On the production he still had a dent in the back of his car because he had used the insurance money for groceries to keep going and not give up on the film. Another communalist, David Skinner, who lived in one in Oregon, went on to finance the making of Smoke Signals, the very first American Indian film to get a domestic distribution deal. It was directed by my friend Chris Eyre, and it was a huge hit. According to Cree director Neil Diamond in Reel Injuns107 both Cuckoo’s Nest and Smoke Signals represented a sea change in the depiction of the American Indian from the former Vanishing American ideology to ones who have broken out of that particular insane asylum and are reconstructing, embracing and celebrating their own culture. This evolution in the consciousness of popular culture and the American Psyche would never have happened on a grand scale if it stayed in the liminal spaces of “The Western” and The Searchers, without the powerful culture and intervention of the Hollywood Renaissance which was started and created by the 60s Flower Children.

In turn, the success of these films were built on the backs of a long line of Westerns that challenged the Colonialist paradigm and stereotype of Indian people as savages, beginning with colonialist manifest destiny film Director John Ford. In his film The Searchers (1956) however, his aperture shots of doorways and caves created a liminal space to beg the questions of colonizer definitions of blood quantum, family and Indianness. There, the Anti-western was born. And the John Ford cave became the very place that John Wayne, the representative of the American cowboy as symbolic of The US foreign policy in Europe, wrestled with his own hegemonic racism in both The Searchers and Cheyenne Autumn about Indigenous people; and in Howard Hawks’ Rio Lobo about women. Director Arthur Penn then took up the Anti-western (read Anti-Hegemonic-Hero) with Little Big Man, and blew apart the liminal spaces of blood quantum and family hegemonic conversations and resulting definitions of what is Indian and what is white; when the protagonist Dustin Hoffman bounces back and forth between the cultures and ends up blending them in himself and therefore the family of man. Talk about bicultural! It occurs to me that these liminal spaces may have been places of consciousness, and if ancient psychotropic drugs were a way to access that consciousness, then the advent of the psychedelic 60s may have had a hand in changing the consciousness of a critical mass of Americans. And is it possible it also accessed ancient DNA memory? Ken Kesey wrote the first chapter to One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest on Peyote, and was thought by his cousin Dale to possibly be Cherokee on his Grandfather Kesey’s side, who was also from Oklahoma. Kesey’s other cousin, Jimmy, is looking into it, he said. There are hundreds of thousands of people on the West Coast with Indigenous DNA. And yes, a great many families I personally know are from Oklahoma, like Hoyt Axton, James Blue, and my Grandmother. Remember that American Indian Activist John Trudell believed in DNA memory. He stated in the film Reel Injuns that these “hippies” may just be remembering: “They were, in a way, trying to imitate us, but in another way they were trying to remember who they were.

But that was not enough, for these images showed intention and choice (…). The thought was again and again before me that this study had created a contact or mingling with minds who had followed a like study in some other age (…). Our daily thought was certainly but the line of foam at the shallow edge of a vast luminous sea.109 The mother of my Grandson, Dr. Sara Waters is a neuroscientist and is constructing research right now with Indigenous people to help their children with transgenerational trauma. Could it be that all of us have transgenerational trauma, and are looking for answers back in time before it all went wrong? That seems to be a logical place to start, to me. Here is a census from 2010. If you look closely at this diagram of it from Wikipedia, you will see, that of the nearly 5 MM Indigenous people and mixed-race people in America are on the West Coast of North America, alone.110 The largest concentration. Even if I feel my generation was generalized, I am grateful to Dr. Deloria, however, for defining Post-modernism so well, because he was one of the first to be so articulate about that paradigm: But Indianness has always been about contradictions, and its uses were hardly confined to this creative, confusing world of free meanings. Indeed, in such a decentered world, many people found themselves searching for something fixed, real, and authentic. Paul Goodman concluded that what really drove the counterculture was a crisis of meaning that was spiritual at base and that “in the end it is religion that constitutes the strength of this generation and not, as I used to think, their morality, political will, and common sense.”111 Which brings me", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634243568_cleaned.txt:44:d05af8de3cbb", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 1472, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634243568_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634243568", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634243568_cleaned", "chunk_index": 45, "text": "uses were hardly confined to this creative, confusing world of free meanings.

No wonder they craved wearing symbolic clothing that expressed their inner consciousness. I believe it was this, in addition to an ever-increasing amount of biculturals like myself in the population, that helped this generation’s ideals reach critical mass. By pushing back on Deloria’s article, I was forced to research even more into my own truth (and consequently the Truth of Yeats’ theories through Literary critic Northrup Frye) where I found Deloria’s Postmodern symptoms were identical to those that Yeats and Frye stipulated as indicating the end of one aeon and the beginning of the next. Just where we are now. For instance, Literary Critic Northrup Frye said, when talking about Yeats’ Gyres of Time: “…prepares not the continuance of itself but the revelation as in a lightning flash, though in a flash that will not strike only in one place, and will for a time be constantly repeated, of the civilization that must slowly take its place.”113 The “revelation as in a lightening flash” was hitting the towers of the new age which were like hotspots all over the country: The Civil Rights struggles in the South with Martin Luther King; Women’s Rights on the East Coast with Gloria Steinem; Environmental Rights on the West Coast with the Sierra Club, and the Anti-war Movement, both in San Francisco; and the American Indian Movement in the Midwest, and from the Southwest came the Hopi Prophesies. Remember, the Hopi had predicted our long hair generation long before 1967. “This is the Eighth Sign: You will see many youth, who wear their hair long like my people, come and join the tribal nations, to learn their ways and wisdom.114 The 8th Prophecy about “many youth who wear their hair long” came true … because I was one of them. The very first very long hair people came from San Francisco, went to San Francisco State, like George Hunter, who became involved in the Red Dog Saloon through the Charlatans. The Red Dog Saloon Cowboy and Indian people became the Family Dog people who started the infamous concerts at the Fillmore, the Avalon, and Winterland.

Although we were popping up everywhere, but when the American Indian Movement took over Alcatraz Island in the San Francisco Bay, the center of all of the Countercultural Movement was there. And the Countercultural Movement had indeed, as Deloria has written, called to ask what was God, now that God was Dead, (and his Dad Vine Deloria had answered, God is Red!;) was taking to task notions of objective Truth, such as what was Democracy, what was Altruistic, which, according to Northrup Frye, by unpacking Yeats’ Gyre’s of Time theory, and his poem Second Coming, began “the counter-active movement” towards another Troy; towards being “strongly individualized” with an antithetical and different birth of a Messianic entity; then to another Charlemagne; another fall again of another Byzantium; back to where we were just at the beginning of the century: objective Truths, Altruistic, and Democratic, in 2000 years, the full cycle of an Aeon. Frye also explains Yeats’ Gyre theories which are also tied in with his Lunar Phases of the Moon: There are two great rhythmical movements in all living beings, a movement towards unity and a movement towards individuality. These are opposed and contrasting movements, and are symbolized in Yeats by a double gyre; a movement in one directions which, as it grows more pervasive, develops the counteracting movement within itself, so that the apex of the next gyre appears in the middle of the base of the preceding one and moves back through it.… Of course it is in history that these cycles are easiest to see. The conception is similar to … Spengler’s Decline of the West. 115 In Yeats this communal consciousness is part of the drive toward unity. It is the primitive mentality in which all historical cycles begin, and the decadent mentality in which they end, hence it is the ‘primary’ rhythm of existence. Over against it is an ‘antithetical’ development of individuality, which reaches its greatest height in the hero. In primitive society the communal consciousness is so strong that there hardly seems to be any real individuality, as we know it, at all.116 …Individuality begins in the unhappy and tormented souls who are aware of a double pull within them around Phase 8.

Individuality then advances to heroic proportions, and we have ‘sensualists’ so complete that they represent a kind of antithesis to sanctity (Phase 13), artists of tempestuous passion, women of fully ripened physical beauty, and heroes of arrogant pride like the heroes of Shakespeare’s tragedies. 117 At the point of highest development represented by Phase 15 the counter-movement back to communal consciousness begins. Artists become less embodiments of passion and more intellectualized (Phase 21), or technicians (Phase 23); heroes come to think of themselves as servants of impersonal force, like Napoleon (Phase 20), or the money obsessed characters in Balzac; women come to be guardians of a generally accepted morality like Queen Victoria (Phase 24). The ‘personality’, which is the fully developed individuality, becomes the ‘character’, a subjective conception implying that something objective to it is greater…119 At later primary stages personality becomes more fragmented, this fragmentation being represented by the physical deformity of the hunchback (Phase 26), and the mental deformity of the fool (Phase 28). What Spengler calls the ‘second religiousness’ comes into society in the forms of spiritualism, theosophy, and various forms of revived occultism, seeking the same kind of kinship with the invisible world, at the other end of the social cycle, that primitive societies show in their myths and folk-tales and so-called superstitions.120 Suddenly, everything makes sense. The Critical Literary Deconstructionists theories born in the 60s like Roland Barthes’ “The Death of the Author,” Derrida’s “Double Liminality”121 and Raymond Williams’ cry for an academic “Structure of Feeling,” are very psychedelic. There is also a new Spiritual Quantum Mechanics Religion emerging within Ernest Holmes’ church of “New Thought” (1926) making room in Christianity for a new understanding of “The Holy Spirit”: The passing of old orders of thought is but a proclamation of the inauguration of new and higher orders. Modern psychology, metaphysics, and philosophy all announce a new birth of the Mind, a new discovery of the self, a new consciousness of the intimacy of the Mind with the subtle Spirit within each of us. There appears to be one persistent purpose behind the great forward movement of evolution, namely, the expression of Intelligence, through creation, into higher, finer, and more complex forms. An insistent and intelligent Urge in the Life-Principle impels it to express. Spirit IS forever clothing itself in form.

Michael Bernard Beckwith. It’s called Agape, and it celebrates all religions and races. For example, one week a relative of Black Elk may lead, another week Martin Luther King, Jr. may lead. Musicians, Artists and Filmmakers have belonged to it since the late 80s. “Since its doors opened in 1986, Agape’s active teaching and practice of the New Thought-Ancient Wisdom tradition of spirituality has expanded into a trans-denominational movement and community; Over 10,000 local members and 1,000,000 friends (streaming) worldwide. Through Dr. Beckwith’s weekly services, Agape’s University of Transformational Studies and Leadership classes, ministries and other outreach programs, the heart of Agape reaches deep into local and global communities teaching individuals about the transforming, healing power of prayer, meditation, and selfless service.”123 I guess you could say that Dr. Rev. Michael Beckwith was just one of the people I know who experienced Frye’s “flash that will not strike only in one place.” In remembering this, I also saw the residual effect of the “lightening striking” people like him, even up here in Oregon. Though they have passed away, they were two of the most important American Indian people to the University of Oregon; and my friends. One of them, Gordon Bettles, was the Steward for the U of O Longhouse from 2003 to 2018. The other was George Wasson, who worked in The Office of Academic Advising and Student Services, and a friend of Kesey’s and mine whom I met in 1969 at The American Indian Student Union. They, too, were very active in the New Age of service, and welcomed us all. Bicultural people have an amazing ability to know each other as “skins” (as Etta Conner called it); and it happened with Gordon the first time I went to the U of O Longhouse in 2004. I was hurting, and needed sacred space. Instinct led me there, and I found it in Gordon’s care. As we are wont to do, he asked me where I was from and I told him Klamath Falls. He nodded his head downward as if he already knew. He asked me my last name. I told him, and he seemed to know even that, too. He softly said with a fond smile, “Your Mother was my 3rd grade teacher in Chiloquin.” And I was home. Thinking of Gordon brings up memories from Chiloquin.

Thinking of Gordon brings up memories from Chiloquin. Not the murders, not the racism and grief and drunkenness, but the good memories. While writing this Chapter, I called my Dad, who knew of Gordon and his family to break the news. My Dad was a Special Education teacher for the 7th and 8th graders there, trying to get them so they could at least pass Jr. High and then try to get their diploma from Klamath Union High School. My Dad was bicultural, too. He really didn’t like school all that much, either. He wanted to be a professional Boy Scout, or a Forester in the woods. But Carroll Howe, the Superintendent of Schools of Klamath County talked him into teaching. Carroll was very sympathetic to the Klamath/ Modoc Tribe and their deplorable situation of being terminated in the early 50s by the U. S. Government. Hiring my Dad, an Eagle Scout, and my Mom, an artist, were something he thought might help, as they both had training in helping non-traditional students. Before long, my Dad was taking these kids to Doak Mountain where he would get Park and Forestry people to share knowledge with them and they would share their knowledge back. One of my favorite memories was learning the names of Pipsissewa and Chinquapin, magical medicine plants. This side of the LSD experience – the feeling! – tied in with Jung’s theory of synchronicity. Jung tried to explain the meaningful coincidences that occur in life and cannot be explained by causeand-effect reasoning, such as ESP phenomena. He put forth the hypothesis that the unconscious perceives certain archetypical patterns that elude the conscious mind. These patterns, he suggested, are what unite subjective or psychic events with objective phenomena, the Ego with the Non-Ego, as in psychosomatic medicine or in the microphysical events of modern physics in which the eye of the beholder becomes an integral part of the experiment.124 And back in the 60s, when it all began, just as Northrup Frye stated, these “white lightning” episodes of consciousness were cropping up everywhere. Us “round thinkers in a square world” had suffered in schools created by business leaders to make good office workers who would do what they were told, sit still at a desk and use small motor skills.

There were teachers at the U of O who cared more about your creativity than your grammar. “The Summer of Love became the template…” says Joe McDonald, the creator and lead singer of Country Joe and the Fish and a boyfriend of one of that summer’s two queens, Janis Joplin. “And it became the new status quo,” he continues. “The Aquarian Age! They all want sex. They all want to have fun. Everyone wants hope. We opened the (LSD consciousness) door, and everybody went through it, and everything changed after that.”125 In those early days of the 60s, even kids who were being abused could be taken home by their teacher. We had a few of them living with us now and then. My favorite was a boy named Deter. What my Mom may have known, but I didn’t know myself, until I, a failing student, started smoking tobacco and drinking coffee to medicate my ADD; was that I was a Special Education child myself. Remedial and Brilliant can be two sides of the same coin. The cigarettes and caffeine helped me get a 4.00my senior year. I took my SAT’s then too, and scored so high the U of O’s head of the English Department called my Mom requesting I go to college. But it was not possible until I survived moving to Eugene the early summer of 1967 with my family, failing English at South Eugene, learning how to drive, and being so totally off the reservation that I didn’t know what to think. That’s when I started to smoke tobacco. When I met my current husband in Art Class, met Actor Ed Ragazzino in Drama Class, started hanging out with these long-haired boys in Errol Flynn dueling blouses tucked in their jeans, and rings on all of their fingers, something clicked. I found my tribe. That’s when my Mom asked me to participate in an ‘in-service’ Educational Sensitivity Seminar sponsored by Eugene’s 4-J school district, with her and a bunch of older teachers. Turns out my super-sensitivity was now in fashion. And “suddenly that summer of 1967^(′′)I , like Dorothy in the Wizard of Oz, knew I was not in Kansas anymore.

My new tribal leader: From an early age, he was fascinated by fantasy, by any hint of exciting and mysterious things just beyond the reach of ordinary experience. He read a good deal as a boy, but until high school that reading was mostly comic books, Westerns, and science fiction – comic books such as Superman, Batman, and Captain Marvel; authors like Zane Grey, Edgar Rice Burroughs, and Jules Verne. This reading was the beginning of a quest, a manifestation of that perennial appetite for transcendent consciousness, a yearning instinctive in most everyone but especially acute in Kesey. It was this desire that enticed him, after he had written two novels, to seek beyond writing – through experiments with electronic media and further experiments with drugs – new forms of consciousness and artistic expression.126 And like Ken, I was soon to realize that writing was not enough, either; that I was a visual artist, sometimes a poet, but not really English Major material. But because of an almost-famous Drama teacher, Ed Ragazzino, and his soft words encouraging me, by telling me I was a natural actress; I joined the long list of the sort-of-famous-in-their-own-way South Eugene High’s “Fame” School Kids; kids that danced to a different beat of the 60s; which included Richard Brautigan, (the voice of the 60s) Tim Hardin, (Woodstock) Julia Anne Robinson, (King of Marvin Gardens) Sue Pack (Holy Modal Rounders) Charlie Milhaupt (Agnes of God) my husband Philip Krysl (Twilight) and Oscar-nominated E. Max Frye. We all had that Oregon Bicultural Cinematic Voice, but by standing on the shoulders of these giants, and looking through their looking glass, I soon became a filmmaker because of them, and because of the Pranksters and Ken Kesey. he Year of Revolt was like Yeats’ revolt against the intellect on a world-wide scale; the intellect as best represented by patriarchy. Patriarchy as Colonialism. Patriarchy as Puritanism. Patriarchy as Capitalism. Patriarchy as Cronyism. Patriarchy as rational, ordered, and linear. And ensued “the struggle between cold Apollonian categorization and Dionysiac lust and chaos”128 as The Divine Archetype of Aquarius was now becoming the Universe’s New Age, and was “claiming it’s kin and bringing all into accord with the divine imprint on it.”129 Everything was patriarchal, starting in the family, where you couldn’t speak at the dinner table unless spoken to,” says Josette Preud’homme, who took part in the 1968 protests as a 20-year-old and says it changed her life. “You couldn’t go out with friends, and never with boys.

Everything was forbidden everywhere. You had to obey orders in the factories, in the schools. We were suffocating. There was this enormous need to talk and share. Everyone was fed up.130 From what I have learned about from Russel Means and others about alternatives to patriarchy, American Indian tribes were mostly matriarchal, in that the seat of power was with women, and their lineage, of course, was never questioned because they birthed it. They decided who they wanted to sleep with. And suddenly with the advent of “THE pill.” women everywhere started doing just that, upsetting the equilibrium between the sexes where men once tried to control women’s sexuality through marriage and other legal means. But that was a one-way street in men’s favor. Events that led directly to the revolt of May 1968 began in March on the campus of the University of Paris at Nanterre, on the far western edge of the city. The children of mostly bourgeois Parisians did not have sophisticated political demands. Their spontaneous occupation of some of the administration buildings was partly a demonstration against the Vietnam War, and partly to demand something closer to home: to be able to spend the night in each other’s dorm rooms. Several students were arrested, and the university was temporarily closed.131 Today in France, the events of May 1968 have taken on romantic, mythic proportions. On the 50th anniversary this month, magazines and exhibitions are devoted to it, and documentaries and conferences are analyzing and re-analyzing it. May 1968 encompassed a cultural revolution, even a sexual revolution, before a political one. And in no other country did a student rebellion lead to a workers’ revolt that nearly brought down a government.132 Why would workers go on strike and support students who wanted to have sex? First of all, it was Paris, which has always been less prudish about sex, but sexual freedom also represented freedoms of personhood that the average worker felt had been compromised by the government. We have talked about the Cultural Revolution in the prior chapters, but what created the Sexual Revolution and this open attitude about sex, now, coming up above from the underground? Sex had always been treated with “kid gloves” in the past, from the Bible’s Song of Solomon to D.H. Lawrence and James Bond movies. But we were in a Sexual Revolution now.

And the revolution WAS being televised! It all began with the influences of First Wave feminists like Gloria Steinem and even Beat Poetry like Allen Ginsberg’s HOWL in 1956, and then by artists and filmmakers, and consequently engendered lawsuits. (in San Francisco) This myth was perpetuated by Ferlinghetti as part of the defense’s case during the poem’s obscenity trial.[3] Upon the poem’s release, Ferlinghetti and the bookstore’s manager, Shigeyoshi Murao, were charged with disseminating obscene literature, and both were arrested. On October 3, 1957, Judge Clayton W. Horn ruled that the poem was not obscene.[4]133 My husband Philip Krysl’s brother-in-law, Peter Michaelson, was friends with Allen Ginsberg, and with Avant Garde Filmmaker Stan Brakhage. They all were living in Boulder, Colorado in the late 60s and early 70s. Peter was a Professor of English at the University of Colorado at Boulder, and was married to Marilyn Krysl, Philip’s sister. She was the head of the Creative Writing Dept. Ginsberg was there, however, because of the Naropa Institute, a Buddhist Enclave surrounding the “Holy Man” Trungpa Rinpoche, who in 1960 had escaped the Chinese Occupation of Tibet by climbing 19,000 feet and walking across the Himalayan Mountains on foot. Trungpa was funded to attend Oxford University and then came to America. His teachings were centered around crushing the ego body/spirit with alcohol, drugs and sex so that the authentic Dharma spirit could emerge; coining the phrase “Crazy Wisdom.”134 “Naropa was founded by Chogyam Trungpa Rinpoche and the Poets Allen Ginsberg and Anne Waldman … and was the largest Buddhist center in the U.S. because of Trungpa, who was a renowned Buddhist Luminary. Ginsberg and Anne Waldman started the writing program there named The Jack Kerouac School of Disembodied Poetics. Guest writers included William S. Burroughs, John Steinbeck IV, Gregory Corso, Gary Snyder, Ken Kesey.”135 Philip first went to Boulder to work as an artist and worked for an academic publisher. One day Peter took him up to Stan Brakhage’s cabin in Lump Gulch near Nederland, Colorado for lunch. Somehow the conversation turned to where Philip and his sister Marilyn were from: Eugene, Oregon. That was when Brakhage told Philip he thought “Eugene was the Poetic Cinema Capitol of the World.”136 “Only the subject of sex,” Brakhage says, “would have had the power to get me to not only make a completely private film, but to also turn my career away from Hollywood.”138 And here is where Stan’s poetic vision and Peter’s academic work merge; and with Beatnik Allen Ginsberg, all come together, in a book written", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634243568_cleaned.txt:53:e13005147eed", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 1481, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634243568_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634243568", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634243568_cleaned", "chunk_index": 54, "text": "his sister Marilyn were from: Eugene, Oregon.

Underground though it may have been, its spirit continues to pervade the study and practice of cinema. This ephemeral state makes documentation of its influence speculative at best. Nonetheless, it is there. And when one sees how television advertisements have, after polishing them up, co-opted the techniques of avant-garde films, one recognizes how pervasive their influence has been.140 The second book, The Aesthetics of Pornography was published in 1971, by Herder & Herder, New York. Peter is also a published poet and writer, and is revered by the counterculture for his work in unmasking the stigmatism of sexuality. The first book delves into Cinema as well as consciousness. It is in an article aptly called “Consciousness And Love’s Body:” Complex or artistic pornography differs from hard-core or simple pornography in not being exclusively committed to the myth of animality and its explicit sexual imagery. And, while soft-core pornography offers ethical encouragement to the sentiments of the status quo, complex pornography, like most artistic modes, explores the moral recognition that necessarily precedes and informs true ethical perception. In the sense then that art is moral rather than ethical, artistic pornography is moral. It is generally distinguishable, however, by its matrix of consciousness, obscenity and the myth of love.141 Peter taught Literary Criticism and the Modern Novel at Notre Dame from 1965 to 1969. In an interview with a former student, they discuss his controversial 1969 academic Pornography and Censorship Conference, with Allen Ginsberg; that the Police raided and shut down. Peter and Ginsberg went way back to the days of the obscenity trials of Ginsberg’s Howl, which Allen also wrote from a peyote-induced vision. As a result, others fought “A series of Supreme Court decisions (which) eased restrictions of movie obscenity, and the MPAA’s liberalized Code and Rating Administration of 1968 replaced the stringent Production Code of 1934.”142 This was because Hollywood was afraid that", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634243568_cleaned.txt:54:f3abf8a7960e", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 1482, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634243568_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634243568", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634243568_cleaned", "chunk_index": 55, "text": "academic Pornography and Censorship Conference, with Allen Ginsberg; that the Police raided and shut down.

Their system put moral judgment in the hands of the parents when it came to questionable content. But Jack Nicholson famously derided the Motion Picture Association of America rating system when it formed in 1968. He said that it was ludicrous, that “if you kissed a woman’s breast in a film, it was an X-rated movie, but if you sliced it off, it was only rated R.” But with those new movie rating “guidelines” in place, we were now able to jump off the cliff into the “New Consciousness” of the “New Hollywood” which was indeed a grand exploration of the “matrix of consciousness, obscenity and the myth of love.” For instance, 1967’s The Graduate was a good example of why the Hays Code was challenged. By exploring the character of Mrs. Robinson in the context of her generation, and the 50s obsession with sex as a well-known reaction to the threat of extinction; (read Nuclear Annihilation) this story brings out of the closest a well-known syndrome known as MILF. (Look it up in the Urban Dictionary.) It’s “obscenity” is poetic in The Graduate. Robert Evans then created an even more eclectic New Hollywood at Paramount a few years later by taking something like The Graduate, and making it even more poetic, aka “obscene” with an 18-year-old boy sleeping with an 80-year-old Grandmother. The Poetics of Harold & Maude was even stronger, however, because it truly was a Love Story. But it would never have been made if Robert Evans hadn’t gambled everything for this new voice in film: “What do you think most studios would have said to me if I Evans’ “magic” saved Paramount by finding stories for and by our generation (Polanski, Coppola, Rafelson) and made history in the late 60s and 70s by exploring truths of this consciousness, obscenity and the myth of love: in Godfather, the gangster family code of honor, archaic in its consciousness and rigid in its love.

And, I might add, expressing both with a violence that was obscene. Just like Bonnie & Clyde, which is a love story, too. When Evans was first hired, Gulf+Western regarded the Paramount lot as merely a piece of real estate. It was ready to sell. Evans, outmaneuvering them, dragged the studio, kicking and screaming, into a cultural revolution, and turned Paramount into the top studio of its day. He saved the lot. He saved the studio. The only studio that is still in Hollywood.144 That cultural revolution is exactly what Yeats was talking about, what Shelley, Walt Whitman and John Keats were getting at with their Apostrophes and The Sublime and its symbolism. Around that time, the Golden Dawn opened a chapter in San Francisco, when 1967’s Love and Peace still echoed from the Flower Children. Robert Evans could feel the vibration. He saved the studio by gambling his severance package of $300, 000 (due him in a bet because the Studio was in danger of folding) that he could turn the studio’s finances around in a year against his 300k . He then began pitching them his idea to turn it around with Romance and Love Stories “that would bring people together” during that violent year of 1968. He also sold them on creating “a trend” in stories that were about “How it feels, rather than where it’s at.”145 And true to his word, the first was aptly called Love Story under his reign. He also made Shakespeare’s Romeo and Juliet, and went on to win 44 (Academy Award and other) nominations during his tenure. However, as Robert Evans is quoted in his documentary The Kid Stays In the Picture; the new age love “is unrequited.”146 There are no happy endings. Even Ken Kesey once said: “There are no more guarantees of “Happy Endings” in films since Kennedy died.” Now, in the “Age of Anxiety” the best we can hope for is an “existential” ending, where we, the audience get to decide if the film has a happy ending or not, because the filmmaker refuses to, like the ending in The Graduate. And I agree, Kennedy’s assassination ended our belief in the power of Good to prevail. It ended our belief in Good, period, and God. In the past, the good guys always won. But God was dead.

We had come out of Plato’s cave, the new vision in our eyes that saw the truth about so many things; about racism and war and equality and sex and we could not unsee them. However, at the end of 1968, after the “Year of Revolt,” as Time magazine called it, there were glimmerings that a new hope or a new Spirituality was on its way, and somehow tied to Synchronicity and Love. A kind of Unified Field Theory, but not dialectic and including gravity. It felt like a Quantum Mechanics’ kind of “Downward Causation” of the Music of the Spheres.147 And speaking of Music, it would take me a whole book to talk about the music from my generation. But it was the soundtrack of our lives, and absolutely inimitable, because it was from the Universe. In 1964, he wrote the screenplay for, and starred in, Flight to Fury, directed by Monte Hellman. In 1965, he co‐produced The Shooting and Ride the Whirlwind with Hellman, also co‐authoring the script of Ride the Whirlwind. Both of these films are brooding, mystical, psychological Westerns which have enjoyed considerable success in Europe but never got off the ground in the United States.148 Monte is known for Two Lane Blacktop (1970) a film which ended abruptly in a metaphor for speed, depicted with film melting and burning in the camera; just like the cars seemed to be doing in the end of the movie. A proven poetic cinema director with his films, even the Roger Corman ones; Monte still wears to this day a belt buckle given to him by Slim Pickens, an ex-rodeo clown and actor, in tribute to his and Jack’s glory days of making Existential Westerns. But unlike the Westerns made as “American Cowboy Archetype” films, which follow the old worn out tale of the “Silver Bullet theory”149; wherein an American Cowboy, a stranger, comes into a community that has a problem, and with quick violence solves the problem and leaves again. That tale of happy endings died when a stranger with a gun came into our communities and murdered our President John F. Kennedy in 1963, and then murdered Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King in March of 1968, and Senator Robert Kennedy in June of 1968. If we, as youth, were not revolting before that, we surely started now.

Suddenly groups of students formed the SDS, the Students for a Democratic Society; the Chicago 7; the Weather Underground; the Black Panthers; the American Indian Movement; all which all erupted world-wide along with the Czechoslovakian “Prague Spring.” In the US, we realized we were on our own, because the Lone Ranger was out of Silver Bullets and his sidekick Kemosabe was unmasked as a Hollywood Indian. There was no going back, anyway, because our mythology of the Old Western had already died in 1962. James Stewart gave a funeral for it in the John Ford directed epic The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance. It was released the same year Kesey’s New Western One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest came out with the bicultural, poetic, and cinematic literary voice. And by the time it came out, Ken was already writing another one of these new mythologies in Sometimes a Great Notion. And it was a New Western, too. It was metaphoric, it was symbolic in Yeatsian ways that are so many layers deep, we are still uncovering them. They truly inspired Directors Milos Forman and Paul Newman when they made these films. I discuss this symbolism in my Chapters on One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest (1975) and Sometimes a Great Notion (1972). I wanted to learn more about the power of such symbology, discourse and ideology while taking Dr. Alilunas’ History of Film II class in 2020, so I chose Howard Hawks’ Red River as my research term paper. That’s when I found, in the Knight Library, Dr. Stanley Corkin’s incredible work in his essay “Cowboys and Free Markets: Post World War II Westerns and US Hegemony”:120 Hawks’ Red River and John Ford’s My Darling Clementine, it shows how the western was well suited to convey important ideological rationales for postwar U.S. foreign policy, including the inevitability of American expansion and the strategies for hegemony that guided the Truman administration’s foreign policy.150 I had already unpacked Cuckoo’s Nest and Sometimes a Great Notion (121) as Poetic Westerns in my first book, Echoes Vol. I before I read this. Turns out that Professor Corkin and I have a lot in common. He had started his scholarly career around Westerns when he wrote his very first paper: “I wrote my first paper in college, at Bard in 1971, about Sometimes a Great Notion, which had its own John Wayne character.”151 In an interview of Professor Corkin, I shared Leslie Fiedler’s theory with him about Cuckoo’s Nest, and he said: I can see John Wayne-type shadows on Randle McMurphy.

I like your discussion and think that connecting the radical individualism of Kesey and his books to the western hero, or anti-hero makes sense. Did you ever see Lonely are the Brave, which can be a kind of Douglas companion piece to Cuckoo’s Nest, or read novels by Wallace Stegner – a Kesey connection or Edward (A)bbey, and then Ivan Doig later. All were trying to reimagine the Western as a vehicle for the any-establishment antihero. Paul Newman was a Hollywood leading man closely connected to this vision of character.152 And when I say Poetic Cinema or Existential Western, it is just another way of using Aesthetics and Poetics in Filmmaking, much like Brakhage did in his films, or Kesey did metaphorically in his books. We are still coming to terms with what to call it … but Poetic Cinema denotes Art House Cinema which is a 60s global phenomenon from filmmakers like Akira Kurosawa to Francois Truffaut; and the Existential Western is certainly not just a Western, or an Anti-western; it too is something born of an Art House cinematic nature, and can embrace people of color as its hero or anti-hero. And speaking of the archetypal Anti-hero, if there was one for my generation on the screen and off, it was Jack Nicholson. In Vol I of Echoes From the Set (2019) I write about the times I stayed at Jack Nicholson’s house, and I quote Jack and Monte from the American Film Institute’s program honoring Jack in a Lifetime Achievement Award. The quote I love from Jack is about the low budget existential westerns that he wrote, co-produced and acted in, made in the early 60s with Director Monte Hellman for Roger Corman: “Roger wanted some good Tomahawk numbers with plenty of Ketchup, but Monte and I were into these films on another level.”153 That “other level” was influenced by 1962’s One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest in its respectful depiction of the American Indian, and the poetics of the New Age Existential Western. Together they redefine the Poetic Cinematic Literary Voice as a bicultural one. I was working on packaging both Jack and Monte in 1991 while producing Ken Kesey’s Last Go ‘Round. Especially fitting since Jack had been up here in Oregon trying to option Cuckoo’s Nest in 1962, when he and Don Devlin were trying to write and option screenplays like Thunder Island to express this new biculturality we had become aware of.

He also bought the rights to Don Berry’s exquisitely bicultural epic Moontrap, while Dennis Hopper had optioned the rights to another one as equally exquisite called Trask by the same author. Paul Newman had bought the rights to Sometimes a Great Notion. There is no mistake that all of these Existential Westerns were being snapped up by Hollywood’s most enlightened filmmakers. Taos, New Mexico after that.156 But in 1968, his and Peter Fonda’s Easy Rider was being filmed with Jack, a film Peter Fonda was quoted as saying that he wrote as an “Existential Western” in the BluRay DVD release copy by Criterion Collections. You can see it in Dennis Hopper’s wardrobe, who is wearing a fringed leather jacket, like the bicultural Oregon mountain man of Don Berry’s Trask. As it turns out, Dennis and Peter only hired Jack after Rip Torn quit: then Poetic Cinema’s darlings Bert Schneider and Bob Rafelson sent Jack to not only replace him, but to keep an eye on the production. They were all working together on producing their first film under their new banner, BBS productions, called Drive, He Said which was to be filmed entirely in Kesey Country, Oregon, the next year. There are many reasons for that, which we will go into in the next chapter. And while Nicholson and Newman were in Oregon, looking for this voice, Ken Kesey had moved on and was returning to his earlier fascinations with filmmaking. As I understand it now, it has always been his favorite medium. By 1968 Kesey had 9000 feet (almost two miles!) of 16mm footage from the psychedelic bus trip to New York and back, he had tons of audio tape, he had footage of the Acid Trips, and he had captured a time that by 1968, we were afraid would never come again, but they were just getting started, as I am hoping this book will show us… Two gentlemen Kesey had met in New York in 1964, filmmakers who had got on the bus, came to help him with the footage. One was the son of a famous writer, Arthur Miller, named Bobby Miller. Marilyn Monroe was his stepmother for a while. The other was Bobby Steinbrecher. In typical Kesey style, he nick-named them as Pranksters. Steinbrecher was named Sky, probably for his luminescent blue eyes. Miller was named Flash. Probably for his eyes, too, which were dark but", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634243568_cleaned.txt:60:1acaee5d493c", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 1488, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634243568_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634243568", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634243568_cleaned", "chunk_index": 61, "text": "Kesey had met in New York in 1964, filmmakers who had got on the bus, came to help him with the footage.

Mike Hagen’s was “Malfunction’ because he was always the one who loved new technology and would puzzle over it until it stopped malfunctioning, like the new 16mm Arriflex that was impossible to figure out. Ken Babbs was “Sky Pilot”; Steve Lambrect was “Zonker,” Dale Kesey was “Highly Charged” and the Bus Chaplain. All of these Pranksters were involved in creative problem solving with regards to Kesey’s footage, and eventually were all involved in film one way or another. Looking for a job once, Dale Kesey randomly called up a Hawaiian TV station, and asked them if they needed a camera man. They said yes. Zonker was always coming up with ideas for commercials like filming Timex watches that accidently were submerged in acid baths, but that still kept ticking. He inspired the character Zonker in the Doonesbury comic-strips. Ken Babbs had a beautiful voice and was so charming and good looking that he belonged on the screen. And I put him there, when he would let me. According to Dale Kesey and Mike Hagen127, they first worked at Bobby Flash’s new house up on Lorane Highway, a bit from Eugene in the South Hills, where his wife Erica and daughter Jessica lived with him. Then Joey Valentine and Bob Laird joined in the editing, and it got so crowded, that Kesey found a house to rent on 10th and Jefferson in Eugene, and they called it the “Film House.” Zodiac and Roy Seburn lived there, as well as Kesey’s parrot Rubiako. The amount of equipment he was buying was becoming quite impressive. And they needed a larger place, so first they rented an empty airplane hangar out by Joey’s place, on Marcola Road, and then the empty KEED station on Day Island Road. The production company was called Far West Action Picture Service. This band of Merry Prankster filmmakers would eventually launch the esteemed Oregon Film Industry, as well as becoming part of what Brakhage called the Poetic Cinema Capitol of the World. Filmmakers like Ron Finne, Loren Sears, Sharon Genasci, Lew Melsen, Gary Neustader, Ulysses Cheng, and Don Cato (who won a Silver at Cannes) had all gravitated to Eugene, merrily making poetic cinema movies. Kesey was the cultural magnet for all of us when he returned to Oregon.

Kesey was the cultural magnet for all of us when he returned to Oregon. We had the Army-Navy surplus store at 666 Willamette Street to buy cheap ends of 16mm film. We had Evergreen Photo to process it. And we had the University of Oregon to support training these filmmakers. “What began as a simple code receiver for the University Newspaper by the Physics Department in 1922, morphed into a full-scale studio for educational broadcasting in 1932, when the ‘Eugene studio on the University of Oregon campus (was) involving journalism, music and speech students. Grant Feikert designed and installed a program control console in a practice room in the UO Music building and telephone lines (speech only) were leased over which to send direct live broadcasts for KOAC.’”157 This became Oregon Public Broadcasting, and attracted filmmakers like Ron West, who worked at its Classical Radio Station KWAX. By 1963, Oregon poetic cinema filmmaker Ron Finne had gone with Haskell Wexler as two of the Cinematographers on a bus with an inter-racial couple to film The March on Washington for the famous James Blue project. He had met Haskell at the University of Oregon where Blue had been a student. And if there was one film I would nominate for making Eugene the Poetic Cinema Capitol of the world I would say it was Finne’s bicultural Tamanawis Illahee: Rituals and Acts in a Landscape, which was “A poetic environmental and cultural history of Oregon. Includes readings by William Stafford, Don Berry and others. Producer, writer, and director, Ron Finne; consultant in history, Edwin Bingham; consultant in literature, Glen A. Love. 700 ft.; color, sound; 16mm film.”158 We were proud to show Finne’s films at our arthouse called Cinema 7 in the early 70s. Loren Sears, another filmophile, graduating from the U of O in 1963; began making avant-garde films and video in San Francisco; became a founding member of Canyon Cinema Coop; and manager of Canyon Cinematheque. He produced numerous artistic /documentary films and videos of alternative and Native American cultures; was an artist-in-residence and guest director, KQED-TV. He taught filmmaking at the San Francisco Art Institute and University of California SF; video at Evergreen State College, Olympia, WA.159 His wife, Pat Ferrero, a paint- er, also became a filmmaker and taught filmmaking at San Francisco State for 30 years becoming the head of the Department. Loren also invented the Optical Printer for Canyon Cinema Corp and had gone to the first Acid Test that Kesey held at Ken Babbs’ house.160 So now you can see how these Eugene innovators all were", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634243568_cleaned.txt:62:21cef27e10fd", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 1490, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634243568_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634243568", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634243568_cleaned", "chunk_index": 63, "text": "the San Francisco Art Institute and University of California SF; video at Evergreen State College, Olympia, WA.159 His wife, Pat Ferrero, a paint- er, also became a filmmaker and taught filmmaking at San Francisco State for 30 years becoming the head of the Department.

But there were even more. U of O Architecture student Don Preston Cato “was an experimental and feature film maker with a strong academic background, a BS and BLA in Landscape Architecture from Michigan State and an MLA from the University of Oregon where he also studied extensively in the department of Motion Graphics. He was the Director of the Eugene Filmmakers Cinematique and his films have screened at an international and eclectic group of venues and festivals: Anthology Film Archives, National Academy of Television Arts & Sciences, Lincoln Center, and the Dylan Thomas Center in Wales.”161 In 1986 he and I joined forces to produce Dixie Lanes with Hoyt Axton, Ruth Buzzi, Tina Louise and Karen Black. We were also proud to show Don Cato’s films at Cinema 7. All of these filmmakers, except for those who have passed away, still stay in touch with each other, including me, Dale Kesey, Bob Laird, Joey Valentine, Ron Finne, Loren Sears, Ron West, Mike Hagen, Ken Babbs, and Bobby Miller. It was members of this conclave of filmmakers that impressed Jack Nicholson so much when he met them in 1969 on Five Easy Pieces that he returned to Eugene to film Drive, He Said in 1970. His friend Robert Towne not only played a role in the film, but started a screenplay from an article his wife found in the Eugene Public Library on shortages of water in the world, which became Chinatown (1974;) and then wrote two other films for Eugene called Personal Best (1981) and Without Limits (1997). The producer of Drive, He Said, Richard Rush, returned here for Getting Straight (1970) with Elliott Gould, and the screenplay writer, Robert Kaufman, returned to Eugene in 1979 to film How to Beat the High Cost of Living. We also think Jack had something to do with One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest filming in Salem in 1975; and just like that, a lot of these filmmakers were also involved in getting National Lampoon’s Animal House and Stand By Me here.

But now that we are once more here – living in the secondary, the soul – we seek for persuasive probabilities: it is through the image we desire to know the archetype.” When Burton Wolfe asked him why … (Kesey) had abandoned writing, he replied. “There are too many things to be done. Until the final earthquake, the big zap when we’re all one again, we’ve got to play a dual role. But it’s coming, things are changing. We’ve already moved out of the Age of Pisces into the Aquarian Age. The millennium started some months ago. 162 And Kesey was right, in 1969, things were really changing. I final-ly finished high school, was going to college, but only because I found a reason to live: Poetry. It was a visual, metaphoric language I could understand. And the radio was playing visual, metaphoric song-poems about this archetype we called “the calling” for years, not knowing what it was, until the songs came out, everywhere, like this one: “Age of Aquarius”: When the moon is in the Seventh House And Jupiter aligns with Mars Then peace will guide the planets And love will steer the stars This is the dawning of the age of Aquarius Age of Aquarius Aquarius, Aquarius Harmony and understanding Sympathy and trust abounding No more falsehoods or derisions Golden living dreams of visions Mystic crystal revelation And the mind’s true liberation Aquarius, Aquarius When the moon is in the Seventh House And Jupiter aligns with Mars Then peace will guide the planets And love will steer the stars This is the dawning of the age of Aquarius, Age of Aquarius Aquarius, Aquarius, Aquarius, Aquarius Let the sunshine, let the sunshine in, the sunshine in.163 This song was from a theatrical play, called Hair; first emerging from an East Village Public Playhouse; debuting on Broadway in April of 1968.

When I knew him, he seemed very pragmatic. This was huge news. But at the time, in early 1969, I didn’t know anything about Broadway or the Underground, but I was soon to find out. And so much I learned came through the lyrics of poetry and music, like this song from 1969, by Crosby Stills, Nash & Young. By the end of the year, I would have seen them live in San Francisco at Winterland: Turn, turn any corner Hear, you must hear, what the people say You know there’s something that’s goin’ on around here That surely, surely, surely won’t stand the light of day, no (it) Appears to be a long time Such a long, long time before the dawn Speak out, you got to speak out against the madness You got to speak your mind if you dare But don’t, no don’t, no, try to get yourself elected If you do you had better cut your hair And it appears to be a long Appears to be a long Appears to be a long time Such a long, long, long, long time before the dawn It’s been a long time comin’ (Long time comin’) It’s goin’ to be a long time gone (Long time gone) But you know The darkest hour Is always, always just before the dawn And it appears to be a long Appears to be a long Appears to be a long time Such a long, long, long, long time before the dawn.”164 What we knew that could not stand the light of day, was the War in Vietnam; because that was really about profit. That particular racism, misogyny, and hate were so deep in Plato’s cave, that we would have to enter the cavern and fight the good fight in the dark, and would then need to bring all of these soul-sicknesses up to the light to heal them. All I could do then was to be a young feminist, throwing pots in art class and adoring my English teacher Jane Middlehurst, who would cry when she read Robert Frost. I wanted to emulate her and teach poetry, and change the world as she had changed mine. I also had a student teacher in Political Science courting me, even though I didn’t know it yet.

He waited until the day after school was out. And sent me a hand-drawn card with a little poem. He was in a band called The Hammond Typewriter and worked in North Beach during the summers that he was attending the U of O in ^(∘)65 , ‘66, ‘67, and ‘68. He was there. You could tell. North Beach, where he worked, was the part of San Francisco that the Beats hung out in, and was part of the Barbary Coast. He worked at a place called Bally-Lo. The shop imported Beatle Suits and other hipster paraphernalia. It also posted all the Avalon, Fillmore, Matrix and Winterland show posters in the windows. He had quite a collection in the room he had at the “Band’s House” in Eugene when I met him. Right after completing his student teaching requirement at my high school, he graduated from the U of O in 1969. That summer he got a job at the Crystalship Record Store downtown. And I went to see him there after he sent me the card. He also had an incredible collection of vinyl albums, that he then loaned to me. He was a wonderful guy that I later married and spent 18 years with, and also had two children with. But something happened a few weeks after I met him that became a point of contention for the rest of our relationship; and in all fairness, he tried hard to navigate the rocky road that I stubbornly clung to, but there was no turning me away from it. Because on July 8th, 1969, the psychedelic bus came by and I got on. And once you are on, you never get off. As a direct result of that, I became a filmmaker, instead of the high school English teacher like he and my parents wanted me to be. This is my story of how that all happened, and how it is still happening after 50 years. By June in 1969, my high school girlfriends were all lined out to attend college. Mary was accepted at Mills, but Edie was going to attend the U of O, after she went to Woodstock in August. My grades were not the best in early high school, so I never really entertained the idea of applying to either. But evidently my SAT scores were high enough to get the attention of Dr. Edwin Coleman III, the Head of the English Department", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634243568_cleaned.txt:66:a5c92db37d60", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 1494, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634243568_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634243568", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634243568_cleaned", "chunk_index": 67, "text": "June in 1969, my high school girlfriends were all lined out to attend college.

But evidently my SAT scores were high enough to get the attention of Dr. Edwin Coleman III, the Head of the English Department at the U of O, and he enrolled me. I didn’t know any of this until 40 years later, that he had called my Mom and asked her why I wasn’t enrolled. My Mom was attending the U of O’s summer school then, getting her Masters. All I knew was that suddenly I was going to go to College, and just as suddenly had enough money to live in the dorms, like my girlfriend Edie was. So on July 8th, 1969, my Mom wanted me to come with her to campus so I could walk around and get to know it a little, while she was in class. She was teaching me to drive a stick shift on our old ‘47 GMC pick-up, and I know I probably ground the gears a lot that day driving to campus. Not trusting myself to parallel park, I took the first parking place I could find, so I could drive straight into it on the corner. It was right across from the ERB Memorial Union, by the Collier House. There was a crowd outside of the EMU’s front door surrounding two men, whom I found out later were debating each other about Communism, on the EMU Free Speech Platform. The old- I was scared of talking to strange men after the last time I had been to the EMU, about a month before for “Seniors Night;” when we graduating seniors from the local high schools were invited to a party there, hosted by the University. To make a long story short, we were then invited to a Frat house party, and I was sexually assaulted by one of the Athletic Department’s finest, after leaving; and walking in the dark to where my girlfriends had gone to, a Motel we rented on Franklin Boulevard. I was trained as a South Eugene Gymnast (State Champions) and the manager of the Track team at Sheldon High School at the time, and was stronger and faster than him, but I carried scissors with me from then on. You can take the girl out of Klamath Falls, but you can’t take Klamath Falls out of the girl.

Evidently Kip Morgan saw my hesitation, and offered to wait there at the EMU with me for my Mom, while Hagen borrowed my truck. As it turned out, Hagen was moving furniture into Kip’s house, not far from there. Now, with happiness in my heart, I can say that Kip and I have had a long-term relationship like Mike and I, that has lasted more than 50 years. And as I attended school the Fall of 1969, the EMU became an incredible Vortex of energy for all of us; whether working, teaching, or studying at the University of Oregon. It was a Vortex of Socializing, of Activism, of being with other Cultures and learning from them. In the basement we created the Black Student Union, along with the American Indian Student Union. It had a grand piano in a rehearsal room where Scott the Lion (Bartlett) held reign while he played. It had a bowling alley, and a barber shop. On the main floor it had a Post Office, a giant Cafeteria (where we filmed the food fight scene from Animal House 8 years later) the EMU Cultural Forum, a long hall where you could sit in window seats and study. Up the grand stairway was the Ballroom, where we saw so many incredibly great shows from George Benson to the Grateful Dead and Bob Dylan. Down the hall from the Ballroom were more window seats and a music listening room. At the end was the Oregon Daily Emerald newspaper, that was on the floor above the Post Office. And I practically lived there. Here was a place I felt at home in. There were Indian people and Black people and they seemed to understand me better than white people did. I was in heaven. While moving into the Dorms, my first roommate and I made a promise to each other that we would not start smoking cigarettes, have sex, or smoke pot just because we were away from our parents. That lasted about a week. She brought home a boy on the basketball team, and I had to sleep in the hallway with my quilt and alarm clock. And after a week of that, of course I started smoking full time, my own packs; instead of “borrowing” from my Mom, as I had done in High School.

Then something happened with her boyfriend that involved dialing O for Operator and reporting an emergency; and I moved down the hall. From then on, all of my dormmates were soulmates. Somehow all of us on the 4th floor of both the women’s and the men’s sections of the Earl Dorms were “radicals.” My friend Terry O’Conner and I would hang out in the “Listening Room” at the EMU together. We would build a fort out of the furniture and put Holst’s “The Planets” on their excellent record player. In an interview for this book with Terry, 50-some years since I last talked to him, I asked him if he felt “called” in the 60s. He said yes, especially when growing up in Marin county across the Golden Gate Bridge from San Francisco, but he said attending the U of O created a “Sphere of Influence.” We will be talking more about how much of an influence this “Sphere” had on him by early 1970, when Hollywood actor Jack Nicholson paid his bail for protesting the Vietnam war. But that fall, we just had fun being 18-year-old innocents going to college for the first time. We had both seen 2001 A Space Odyssey and loved the soundtrack, which we also played in the Music Room. I had dropped mescaline with Kip Morgan earlier that summer when we went to see it at a drive-in movie theater, and when we saw that in places the night sky and the movie screen would become one universe, we threw a blanket on the grass and watched it without anything between us and the image. Speaking of image, the image of director Stanley Kubrick’s monolith, which in the film represented the evolutionary download of what was later touted as the “100th Monkey Theory” or “evolutionary knowledge” was, to us, addressing the Archetype of an ancient Aeon that implicated our own age’s technology in what would become the defining principle of Darwin’s “ survival of the fittest.” That scene was also so powerful because we knew deep inside that we had been there aeons ago. And that technology itself was birthed from early man picking up a bone and using it as a weapon. That technology was what had now created everything we were against, as In the same film, Chan Laughlin answered her statement with: (When you drop acid) “…you get the whole world disassembled before you so you can examine the component parts seriously…”166 That was how", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634243568_cleaned.txt:69:87d504626ae9", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 1497, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634243568_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634243568", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634243568_cleaned", "chunk_index": 70, "text": "was also so powerful because we knew deep inside that we had been there aeons ago.

Listening to the soundtrack while living in the dorms kept me anchored in my new-found reality of cosmic consciousness. And if the EMU was the Vortex of this Sphere of Influence at the University of Oregon, Villard Hall was The Matrix. What started in 1922 as just a receptor for code signals became, by the time Kesey majored in Speech and Communications at the U of O a full-fledged Oregon Public Broadcast Studio housed at the top of Villard Hall. In 1956 the U of O even sponsored a “U of O Campus Film Group formed by the Dept. of Speech and Drama, the Art Museum Desk and the School of Architecture and Allied Arts.”167 Mike Dilley, U of $\\textcircled { < } \\textcircled { < } 1$ , became a Filmmaker after participating in the activities on the top of Villard Hall. His story is that as a child in Eugene, when local radio station KORE would broadcast live a children’s show (before the Saturday matinees) from the McDonald Theater stage Saturday mornings; the host would choose randomly from the audience and interview the kids and record them on a disk-cutting lathe. He would then give the record to the kids in return for participating.168 The process fascinated Mike, and he ended up ordering a kit from EICO to build his own amplifier. By the time he was a This service provided “…about 50 dedicated back-line phone lines of “Muzak” to different Department Stores, Elevators, etc.”169 He also performed in a Folk Trio for these early OPB video and audio programming at the top of Villard Hall in the early sixties, and as a result of the Trio performing at Tino’s Italian Restaurant at 15th and Willamette streets on weekends, ended up getting discovered by Hollywood Producer Harold Hecht, who was in town filming The Way West in 1967. Mike went on to work as a Stunt Man on Elliott Gould’s Getting Straight, also shot in Eugene in 1969. The early 70s found him creating and designing recording studios and providing his services for films over the next several decades, when he created the Eugene International Film Festival.

Ron West, U of O ‘69 BA. remembers attending the University of Oregon’s first film class in the Spring of 1969.170 When he first attended the U of O in 1963, as a freshman, he answered an ad in the Oregon Daily Emerald for a job at KWAX as an announcer. He soon moved up to Program Director for a Friday night music show, and was consequently hired by several other radio stations in Eugene as a DJ. Like Ken Kesey and Mike Dilley before him, he also attended the University of Oregon in Speech and Communications, and ended up becoming a filmmaker. By this time, however, the U of O had a professor who had experience in Broadcasting. His name was Ed “Fast Eddie” Halle, and was one of two professors teaching “a film class;” even though they were listed as Speech and Communication classes in the Spring of 1969 called Seminar on TV and Film407 and 507. Ron went on to get his Masters at Brigantine U ^(′)84 ; and in ‘94 his PhD. in Seattle at the University of Washington. He currently works for his own company called Work Print Productions in Portland. And he is one of the most brilliant people I know. By 1969, full programs for OPB were being created at the top of Villard Hall, and my partner in film on and off for the last 50 years, Bob Laird, (UO ‘70) was finally getting closer to graduating. He had an Athletic scholarship to the U of O for the 1962-63 and 63-64 school year (Swim Team) but then worked in the Haight/Ashbury for a few years and returned to the U of O for the 69-70 school year, like me. He graduated in 1970, in Speech and Communications, like Kesey and Mike Dilley had a few years before. While at the U of O in the early 60s, he was legendary Producer Don Simpson’s roommate in the Phi Delta Theta Fraternity (U of O ‘67) a Duck who would become the infamous producer of Top Gun, Flashdance and Beverly Hills Cop, etc.. One day, while watching TV in the fraternity, they looked at each other and went “We can do that, we should get into this.”171 From then on, Don Simpson kept in touch, as they both ended up in San Francisco during the Summer of Love.

Don had found a job promoting films in the Bay Area, but in the Fall of 1969, he followed Laird back to Oregon to “feel the pulse” of the film-going Baby Boomers. He invited Kesey, Bob and Babbs to a special Premiere of Woodstock at the Baghdad Theater in Portland, and Ken took them and others in the Psychedelic Bus. Laird was learning his future job with Public Broadcasting up at the top of Villard Hall; where they had a small stage, two giant cameras, and a sound-switcher. First, he said, “You would take a beginning TV Class, and learn how to use the camera. They had a first sound taping machine, about six feet high. After the basic class, you could learn how to work the control booth. And then learn how to “Ready Camera, Switch, and Dissolve.”172 While 1969 was still young, The Beatles had even formed a new content company, called Zapple. They invited Ken Kesey in January to walk around London and record his impressions, much like Ken and Babbs and the Pranksters did, in some 100 hours of audio tape in the early 60s. They also invited Ron Finne. The day I called him about an interview, he said he had just found his recently deceased wife’s, (Mary-Lou) notes on that event. He said “…in Feb 1969, he showed his film How Old Is Water to George Harrison at Apple.”173 The only way to reach universality is horizontally, never pre-tending to abandon the realm of particularity; the way leading through a completing translation, making various languages “clash,” “marry,” and “weave into” one other. This openness towards “translatability” (Tradierbarkeit) reveals the heterogeneous element present in all languages: their wishful gesturing towards universal communication. In this manner, the Marrano strategy offers an alternative practice of universalization, conceived as an “after-Babel project” to mend the broken whole from within, horizontally, without assuming the lofty abstract position of a general meta-language, but through the effort of bi- or multi-linguality, and also without over-stressing the catastrophic nature of the Babelian dispersion of tongues.177 It took me 50 years to find out what this voice was, and I owe it in part to my friend and scholar Anne Richardson, (who discussed with me thinking out-loud of Oregon as “cross-cultural,” and then schooled me that it was “bi-cultural”) and there is a huge difference.

During the summer I loved hanging out with Kip Morgan and his friends at the 1010 High Street Commune. It was an incredible group of people. Connie Epstein managed the New World Coffee House, and she was the Den Mother. Ron Eachus was the Editor of the Oregon Daily Emerald; and had a girlfriend named Louise living there; David Gwyther was there, as was Lew Melsen, who would later become a fellow filmmaker, and once brought a Venison roast over and asked me to cook it. Having grown up in Indian Country with avid duck, geese, and deer hunters I knew my way around the kitchen. But the truth is I am a vegetarian at heart who has an O blood type, so it makes me a problem eater because I have to eat meat. But not long after I met all of them, Kip and David’s political activities regarding the Vietnam War in 1967 came surging up from the Underground. Evidently, they had conducted street theater with their Draft Boards and served them very adept Indictments for War Crimes. Street theater was a great way to critique politics. And a very serious way. It is important to me to include these actual indictments, because these men were persecuted and labeled dangerous and dark forces of the underground; when in fact, it was they who had left Plato’s cave, and gently and articulately told The Truth about what was happening in Vietnam, hoping to bring it into the light. The other force that was contributing to their dilemma was the Media. Just like David Getz, the drummer for Big Brother and the Holding Company said, when the media twisted the truth about the psychedelic scene in 1967, they never knew “what the Spirit was about,”178 just the sensationalism of the New Journalism. Kip and David had trumped up charges against them that eventually put them in jail. But I have known them for 50 years, and I can attest to the fact that they were and still are about Truth, Peace and Love. But in the summer of 1969, they were hauled back into court, and Kip was put into jail, and I had to leave 1010 High Street to concentrate on my studies. That was when I met Ken Kesey one night, when he dropped by Kip’s house, who was being interviewed by Life magazine about fighting the draft. Ken took us all to Dairy Queen afterward", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634243568_cleaned.txt:73:b967c7928866", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 1501, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634243568_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634243568", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634243568_cleaned", "chunk_index": 74, "text": "attest to the fact that they were and still are about Truth, Peace and Love.

That was when I met Ken Kesey one night, when he dropped by Kip’s house, who was being interviewed by Life magazine about fighting the draft. Ken took us all to Dairy Queen afterward for ice cream, and of course I wanted the most expensive item on the menu, a banana split; but he smiled and graciously paid for it. That’s when I was officially on the bus, the very bus that was now wired “to seek beyond writing – through experiments with electronic media and further experiments with drugs – new forms of consciousness and artistic expression.179 In the late fall, something happened. My Dad called me and told me they really couldn’t afford for me to go to school Winter term, or any term. I was devastated. But the Universe provided. I found a job in the Oregon Daily Emerald, as a model, for $25 an hour. Initially I was very suspect about the high fee, like a hooker’s! Back then, minimum wage was $1.95 an hour. You could rent a place for $25 for a whole month! I met with him anyway. Prankster Mike Hagen also helped me pay for my books when he hired me to be in a Poetic Cinema Short. Ulysses Cheng was there and had Kesey’s Arriflex, Hagen ran the Nagra for ambient sound. I was the sad-eyed lady of the lowlands, worried about my future, the world, Vietnam, and our Earth. That is what they wanted to film. And they had me walk to the U of O Pioneer Cemetery. Little did I know what the Universe held in store for me. At the time, I wanted to be a Poet. I didn’t want to be a model or actress really. I thought film was frivolous. How wrong I was. Because the world needed us poets to interpret our culture in all mediums. Just like Hagen and Uly and Kesey and Brakhage were doing in the Poetic Cinema way. So, I have no doubt that what happened next was because the Gods of Film wanted Jack Nicholson to meet them too, in a great-minds-think-alike-way. He had already been up here wanting to option Cuckoo’s Nest in 1962, and had bought film rights to Don Berry’s Moontrap outright.

No wonder the lunch at Denny’s for Five Easy Pieces lasted a week. He was in filmmaker heaven. On Thanksgiving Day, 1969; I was on my way with my family to my Grandmother’s house in Klamath Falls. Right before you leave I-5 Freeway south to exit onto Highway 58 to Klamath, is a Denny’s restaurant. I drove right by it. Little did I know that on the same day, not finding anything open for lunch, a rag tag group of filmmakers had seen the sign “Always Open” and stopped for lunch while caravanning up to Puget Sound. They filmed the infamous “Chicken Salad Scene” there, and then courted by Oregon’s Film Commissioner Warren Merrill to stay the night at the Eugene Hotel, and have the only Thanksgiving Dinner around on him. They ultimately spent 5 days filming from Lowell to Florence in Lane County. The film was called Five Easy Pieces and would be nominated for 4 Academy Awards. It was pure Poetic Cinema. And I KNOW that Jack and Cinematographer Laszlo Kovacs and Bob Rafelson fell in love with the Eugene Hotel crowd, an eclectic group of artists and filmmakers like Mike and Uly; because not only would Jack and Bob Rafelson, with their BBS Productions, bring Jack’s next film, Drive, He Said to Eugene a few months later, but Producer Richard Rush brought Getting Straight, his film with Elliott Gould to Eugene too, in July. And DP Laszlo Kovacs was the link. There they made history, because Jack Nicholson, Karen Black and Sally Strothers would act in the first real poetic cinema commercial success, Five Easy Pieces, under the direction of Bob Rafelson. And yes, it’s true: “Bob was regarded as one of the founders of the New Hollywood movement in the 1970s.”180 One could say that Five Easy Pieces was pure Yeatsian in its portrayal of a man, ( Jack Nicholson) who came from a wealthy family and was trained as a concert pianist, only to abandon his heritage and work as a foreman on oil derricks near Bakersfield, California. As the prodigal son, he then returned to his family upon news from his sister that his father had had a stroke. His girlfriend (Karen Black, a waitress) returns with him, only to be ridiculed by the family’s intellectual snobbery in a scene involving the family dynamics that he had run away from.

In an incredibly powerful scene, he then goes to spend time with his stroke-ridden deaf and mute father, who is in a wheelchair (and metaphorically placed on the edge of a cliff by his son) trying to talk to him. Jack instead is the one who then steps off the metaphorical cliff, when he leaves his family, his car and his pregnant girlfriend at a truck stop, by getting a ride with a trucker, that is bound for Canada. “Just get out the back Jack.” Like Jack’s standing up for Karen against the intellectual snobbery of his family’s milieu; over and over again, Kesey also pitches heart against intellect. Little did Jack know that someday he would win an Academy Award for portraying the Anti-hero in Kesey’s Cuckoo’s Nest. And he would go on to have a full career portraying these Kesey-ian characters over and over again. I like your discussion and think that connecting the radical individualism of Kesey and his books to the western hero, or anti-hero makes sense. Did you even see Lonely are the Brave, which can be a kind of Douglas companion piece to Cuckoo’s Nest, or read novels by Wallace Stegner – a Kesey connection or Edward Abbey, and then Ivan Doig later. All were trying to reimagine the Western as a vehicle for the anti-establishment antihero. Paul Newman was a Hollywood leading man closely connected to this vision of character.181 …(S)elf-creation- it can take many forms. It can be the long and difficult remaking of an inherited (determined) practical consciousness: a process often described as development but in practice a struggle at the roots of the mind- not casting off an ideology, or learning phrases about it, but confronting a hegemony in the fibres of the self and in the hard, practical substance of effective and continuing relationships. It can be more evident practice: the reproduction and illustration of hitherto excluded and subordinated models; the embodiment and performance of known but excluded and subordinated experiences and relationships; the articulation and formation of latent, momentary, and newly possible consciousness. Other major film makers agree, all noting with wonderment Nicholson’s almost unprecedented capacity for range in his performances – from the bespectacled introvert of The King of Marvin Gardens to the bawdy iconoclast of The Last Detail to the pseudo‐suave idealist of Chinatown to the frizzy‐haired boob of The Fortune.

The stranger who comes into a community to risk his life to solve their problem, but leaves again without marrying the girl or joining the community? That’s the Jack I know and love. Jack the writer of existential westerns with Monte Hellman in the early sixties, now studying his role as a way of depicting “the total stranger,” just like the lone gunman who is the definitive American Cowboy Archetype; is now “confronting a hegemony in the fibres of the self” in the New Age. We find that particular hegemony of the American cowboy was not only representative of “the bad guy” of white supremacy and patriarchal dominance, and what used to be known as the Good Guys; but is now, out of necessity, being confronted by the Anti-hero. Just like we can see in Jack’s films: Within real pressures and limits, such practice is always difficult and often uneven. It is the special function of theory, in exploring and defining the nature and the variation of practice, to develop a general consciousness within what is repeatedly experienced as a special and often relatively isolated consciousness. For creativity and social self-creation are both known and unknown events, and it is still from grasping the known that the unknown-the next step, the next work-is conceived.”183 ed women, and married women, like me. I was safe, I think. And I didn’t want anyone’s baby, and he knew that. With the advent of the sexual revolution, especially coinciding with or as a direct result of readily available birth control, a refreshing honesty about sex developed between men and women. And even in 1969, when babies were conceived accidently, we knew where to go for an abortion. Of course this was not ideal, but it was a step in the right direction of freeing men and women from an age-old mores’ of shame and blame, and when people are freed from outdated constructs, they are then free to come back into balance. And for the most part, men are truly coming back into balance about sharing responsibility for the consequences of sex, like Jack. He was a wonderful father, too, if how he was with Jennifer, whom I used to play with, is any indication. And I know he took responsibility for the children he sired.

He was a wonderful father, too, if how he was with Jennifer, whom I used to play with, is any indication. And I know he took responsibility for the children he sired. He had a refreshing if not unusual morality. The Anti-hero that Jack played is a more humane version of the hero, even if he is a downright outlaw, especially when society has become rigid in its outdated rules. In both cases, the Outlaw becomes a hero when he thinks for himself, and when society decides he is right. For instance, here is an example in one of Jack’s very first films: The Broken Land (1962) as found on IMDBPro: “A cowboy rides into a small town that is ruled with an iron fist by a corrupt Sheriff. He becomes involved with a pretty young town girl and some residents who are trying to oust the Sheriff, resulting in a robbery, a murder, and his being pursued by a vengeful posse.”184 Our Jack works within the community to help the girl and doesn’t leave her alone. And like Jack, in the film, our generation didn’t feel that we had just a corrupt Sheriff, we felt the whole system was corrupt. Because the old heroes of the Piscean AEON of the Fisher King Mythology were dead. And Merlin was dead. But the “Literary Shaman” Ken Kesey had created a New Mythology with a New Hero, who was depicted as an Anti-hero, but went through the same Heroes Journey to find redemption, and as a consequence, even sometimes died for the greater good. I agree with the first part of this quote: “An antihero or antiheroine is a main character in a story who lacks conventional heroic qualities and attributes such as idealism…” but I disagree that he or she lacks “courage and morality.”161 The New Sheriff in town of the New Westerns of the 60s may be full of existential hubris, but they were even more courageous and moral, especially without the belief in a punishing and/or rewarding God. When we meet Dupea he’s just plain ol’ “Bobby,” working as a hand in the California oil fields, but when his father’s illness draws him back to the family compound on an island in Washington State, we learn that Bobby was trained from the cradle to be a piano prodigy, before he dropped the concert hall for the honky-tonk. Times of the Red Dog Saloon164 when he said, using musical terms, that the 60s in San Francisco went from Medieval (Gregorian Chants) to Classical (Mozart) to Baroque (Bach) in three short years (1965-66-67).

Wikipedia tells us the “The ‘five easy pieces’ of the title refer to piano works; along with Mozart’s Piano Concerto No. 9 in E-flat major and in his Fantasy in D minor we hear pieces by Chopin and Bach.”186 In Five Easy Pieces, his sister represents his Medieval, the family “love”; Susan Anspach is the classical “love he finds,” and is playing Mozart. As the New York Times states “ In “Five Easy Pieces” (1970) …she is a “New Age intellectual who sleeps with Jack Nicholson’s character, even though she’s engaged to his brother.”187 The table has been turned on him. Karen Black represents his Baroque, period, especially after turning his back on his family and living the life of the songs in the Honky-Tonk. Yet he defends her against the intellectuals at his family’s house; giving us a clue as to why he may have left in the first place. But even Karen Black, called a “hash-slinger” from also working in a Diner, is confronted with her own shadow too, in the scene with the waitress who tries to exert control over Jack in the Chicken Salad Scene, and where he explodes. This is what I was talking about as the New Age behavioral role-reversal upsetting the equilibrium between the sexes in the New Age. The Anti-hero that Jack plays is confronted with his own hegemony. Black also sings “Stand By Your Man,” a Baroque Country-Western Contemporary song. But when Susan Anspach’s character plays Mozart, Jack is confronted with his own deep-rooted DNA memory of family, and disappears into the mystery to find himself again, And I was always hoping, to reinvent himself again. But in order to do that, he leaves his pregnant girlfriend (Karen Black) at a truck stop with his wallet and car, when he disappears to Canada with a truckdriver. Writer Carole Eastman’s brilliant indictment of the double standard and the evolutionary forces of what was happening in our generation, was cutting it really close to home with the Jack I knew. Come to think of it, all of his roles were an exploration of himself and the place he found himself in. Ironically, he fathered a child with Susan, a boy.

This was in the early 90s because he and Susan were in court, hashing out the ownership of a house Jack had provided for the child. As a casting director, I would say he represented a perfectly chameleon-like actor, who could play “everyman, the anti-hero” and he did. I think he must have wondered about his absent father a lot. His imagination about his situation may have created the fantasy of an iconic representative of the new male in the new age. When asked to support a women’s movement, he is said to have replied: “I have my own favorite downtrodden minority, and it’s not woman. It’s the bastard, the illegitimately born.”188 And weren’t the 60s James Bond characters always orphans? Could it be that our nation’s Archetype of the Lone Cowboy, who has no history, no family, and who comes into a community to solve its problems with the bad guys, who brings the problem to a head with the courage of confronting it; uses sudden quick violence to solve it, and then sadly leaves again, alone, without bonding with the community; even though he may have fallen in love, may have even made love, and left the seed of a child within her, but still, he leaves her; could this be the shadowland of his “bastard, the illegitimately born”??? Isn’t that what he does in Five Easy Pieces with Karen Black? With “Candy” in One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest and I love how the New Western boldly explores this mythology within its Hero-Anti-hero dialectic. And how, as we discussed in the last chapter, Five Easy Pieces was Yeatsian in how the protagonist “revolts against the intellect;” especially in the scene that Carole wrote with “the character of a highbrow party guest (Irene Dailey) at the Dupea estate, who goes into ecstasies over Ray’s (Karen The rumors that Jack was trying to put together his own repertoire film company back then … were true.

Like the rest of America, Hollywood was ripe for revolution in the late sixties. Cinema attendance was down; what had once worked seemed broken. Enter Bob Rafelson, Bert Schneider, and Steve Blauner, who knew that what Hollywood needed was new audiences – namely, young people – and that meant cultivating new talent and new ideas. Fueled by money from their invention of the superstar TV pop group the Monkees, they set off on a film-industry journey that would lead them to form BBS Productions, a company that was also a community. The innovative films produced by this team between 1968 and 1972 are… – works that now range from the iconic (Easy Rider, Five Easy Pieces, The Last Picture Show) to the acclaimed (The King of Marvin Gardens) to the obscure (Head; Drive, He Said; A Safe Place), all created within the studio system but lifted right out of the countercultural id.190 Jack, to me, was the absolute symbol of that id. I have mixed feelings about writing about him in this way, because of my love for him. But in trying to talk about the archetype emerging in the 60s and early 70s in film, the New Age of sexuality, etc. and the New Cinema trying to express it, it is because it is through these images that we know the archetype. And these quotes have been such a wonderful guide for me, a bicultural poet who receives words as images that have to have time to be unpacked; kind of like what Kesey’s Merry Prankster Mountain Girl had to say about Jerry Garcia: “I think he had synesthesia, which is the professional word for when you [hear a sound and it causes you to] see color and sculpture.”191 Except what happens to me is, when I hear a word I see color and images.

And he hired a lot of them for the film. Somewhere I once read that he even dragged Anjelica along for the games up here. He also loved the Country Inn Restaurant out Coburg Road, and would fly in just for dinner. I once called there to see how much it might cost, and they actually told me if I asked, I couldn’t afford it. The basketball players I knew then were Nick Jones, and another named Walt, who was dating my dormmate. I’ll never forget that Nick would sit at the Student Union’s (EMU) “King of the Hill” Booth and take our adulations in good humor and stride. Walt was always mortified to see me, because I had to call the operator to report an emergency one night while he was making love to my roommate, three feet away from me, and he got stuck in her “diaphragm.” So Jack loved Eugene’s premiere basketball team. We all did, back then. The second thing Jack loved was that the story involved another MILF situation, where the illicit affair was with Olive, (Karen Black) who was married to the basketball player/student/protagonist’s favorite professor. The third thing was that professor was played by Robert Towne (whose wife found an article at the Eugene Public Library that became the fodder for Chinatown). And the fourth thing was that Jack must have loved was my radical dormmates, because he had hired all of them for the student protest scenes. And because they were in his sphere of influence, they kept him updated on our campus’ student unrest activities. I heard a lot about the filming in the dorm cafeteria, where we would all eat together. Several of them were really involved in the political scene, like my dear friend Rick Johnson, who was the head of the Bail Fund Committee for protestors in Jail.193 And I was there that fateful day, April 24th, 1970; the day that Jack not only filmed the protests, but as promised, put up their bail money, although I didn’t know it at the time. Terry O’Conner told me that it took an extra day to release “the out of state kids” because of “flight risk.”194 And I", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634243568_cleaned.txt:82:1cb1f1c9bedd", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 1510, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634243568_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634243568", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634243568_cleaned", "chunk_index": 83, "text": "the political scene, like my dear friend Rick Johnson, who was the head of the Bail Fund Committee for protestors in Jail.193 And I was there that fateful day, April 24th, 1970; the day that Jack not only filmed the protests, but as promised, put up their bail money, although I didn’t know it at the time. Terry O’Conner told me that it took an extra day to release “the out of state kids” because of “flight risk.”194 And I knew Jack had promised to put up bail if they were arrested, because our other dormmate H.J. Langtry told me that as he chased after me as I was leaving that day, telling me to please stay, because Jack wanted me in this scene. But I said “No. I can’t. I am failing biology.” I really was failing biology, I just confirmed that with my transcripts. From a 3.79 GPA fall term and being on the Dean’s list; to failing my Biology Midterm and having to pull off a ^(ω)C^(p) for Winter term. When this happened, early Spring term, I was determined to not let my political activities interfere again, like they did in January and February. Of course I did not believe Jack would put up their bail money for some reason. By then I had been pranked enough to be skeptical. Imagine my shock all these years later learning that he had! That day, according to Lynn Peterson, who is one of my oldest, dearest friends and was an extra, “We were filming with Jack over by Deady Hall, when suddenly we heard that someone had called the National Guard on the Protestors at Johnson Hall. I think Jack had even let it be known that if it escalated to that level, he was going to film it. Jack started to run over to Johnson Hall, and the rest of the cast and crew followed as quickly as we could, carrying equipment.”195 The War that was tearing our country apart, brought us together. And Film brought even more of us together that year. Because of Drive, He Said, we now had a larger film crew base, and the following photographs are of two other people who worked on Drive, He Said, that are still part of the community of the Prankster Filmmakers. A photograph that Uly took of me that year is in the middle. James and Uly feel like family to me. 20 years later we had a reunion with my friend Hoyt Axton at Graham Marden’s house; and 30 years later we got together again at Horton’s Hideaway in Portland. 40 years later we met at a party I held with Chris Miller, the first writer on Animal House.

It’s now our 50th Anniversary, but because of COVID, we have been talking by phone. According to Terry O’Conner, another close dormmate, it was very clear about what brought us all together. He called it a “sphere of influence” that was generated right next to our dorms: The Erb Memorial Student Union. He was one of my favorite people, ever, and still is. He said what keeps our group together is that “We carry on, speaking our Truth.”196 Drive, He Said opened in New York on June 13. 1971. Starring Karen Black and William Tepper, the film was about sex and radicalism on the campus, a theme which was about two years out of date. Most of the critics were kind to Nicholson the director, finding interesting tidbits of staging here and there in the picture. On the whole, though, the film bombed. Disappointed but not wholly dissatisfied (“The kids on my college campus said a lot of things about society that I wanted to say”), he returned to full‐time acting with a vengeance. “But acting,” he told me, “is only one part of my four‐ part development as film maker.” Next June, Nicholson will direct a film called Moontrap, a Western for which he has co-authored the script and which he also will produce.”197 According to Bob Colbert, Jack’s Business Manager, Moontrap is still Jack’s favorite story ever, as it is mine. It “is still in the vault.” Written as a book by Oregonian Don Berry and published in 1962, the same year as Cuckoo’s Nest, it is as bicultural a tale as you can get. The Governor’s Office of Film and Television’s Executive Director, David Woolson and I met with Bob Colbert at La Scala in Beverly Hills, to try to see if we could help Jack make his dream come true, to get it filmed. There is a saying in LA, “half a dollar,” coined by a Bank of America film loan officer. If you can raise 1/2 Million, you can make any movie you want. Guess what number Bob came up with? I am still working on it. But now I just call Jack to wish him a Happy Birthday almost every April 22nd since 1975. That’s 45 years he has had the same phone number.

According to Strauss, writers like Spinoza resorted to secrecy and concealedness primarily because of fear: they avoided the issue of ‘coming out’ due to the anxiety of persecution, caused by the discrepancy between their radical views and the opinion of the masses, still entrenched in their fixed cultural identities. They were, therefore, forced to convey their messages “in between the lines” to connect with those in the similar position, capable of immediately recognizing the “secret message.” And YES, we created a lot of “Slang” words, that were secret mes-sages; but mostly we were metaphoric, we were poetic, we were Ono-matopoeic, we were “La Nouvelle Vague,” (the new vague) we were “The New Wave,” we were the “Miracle Subterfuge Artists.” And by 1971, we were just not “half a million”199 but “millions strong.” and like the Marranos of the Middle East, who were Jewish, but captured in the dominant and conquering culture of Christianity; we found a way to survive as “bicultural.” And like other biculturals, like the American Indians colonialized by Christian Europeans, especially in their Boarding Schools; we were careful and talked “between the lines.”200 Nietzsche was right. Modernity had killed God: “The feeling that God himself is dead is the sentiment on which the religion of modern times rests.’ G.W.F. Hegel.”201201 And it was not cool to talk about it. But by 1971, our belief systems had also become Paganistic, similar in the celebration of Pastoral Religions; but what it was, even more important than that, was our spirituality was more like Archaic Quantum Mechanics. This can best be summed up by a man named Ernest Holmes, who wrote a book in 1926 called The Science of Mind. And unlike the cult of Scientology, which gave Science of Mind a bad name by its similarity in name only, this belief system was not religion, but closer to an Quantum Science spirituality, an amalgamation of all faiths’ truths throughout the world. It was shocking because it was not dualistic. Imagine after nearly 33 years of believing this way, then finding a “Spiritual Center” in Los Angeles based on this same idea, and founded by Black Man who in the 60s was jailed for dealing dope, but was “schooled” there by his grandmother with this book.

Since there is but one Spirit, and this Spirit is you and everything, then everywhere you will go you will meet this Spirit in all people and in all places, and in all things. This one Spirit, which manifests Itself in and through all, including you, automatically adjusts parts to the whole. Therefore you may accept with positive certainty, that the Spirit within you goes before you and prepares your way. Your faith is placed in something as positive and certain as the laws of life, exact as the principal of mathematics, something ever present as the ethers of space, ever operating like the laws of nature.203 “…a Marrano whose main motivation is not fear, resentment, and revenge, but a ‘magnanimous’ (Arendt 2007, p. 275) wish to become universal – without, at the same time, giving up on the cultural difference and heterogeneity.”206 Furthermore, it allowed us to be free thinkers, and to just step off of the cliffs, trusting. Just read Quantum Physicist Amit Goswami’s The Self-Aware Universe. And if “free thinking” needs a space, it is delivered precisely by this very void or the radical emptying of all identitarian logic, which paves way to truly liberated – i.e., uprooted – philosophical reflection. It is, however, possible to combine these two views which seem contradictory only on the surface: in fact, the Marrano sub-identity (where the prefix sub-suggests another and more complex level of identification and simultaneously a subversion of simpler models of belonging) uses both strategies, conjunctive and disjunctive, in order to combine heterogeneous influences and, at the same time, gain distance to the cultural totalities from which they derive.207 The thing about film, like any art, is that it filled that void. And allowed us to speak archetype in images, in metaphor, and in song, because they became the best languages for our generation. Speaking of moving archetype into images; the film Getting Straight was made here at Lane Community College just a few months before Five Easy Pieces arrived in Eugene in November. The film starred Elliott Gould, who had just been nominated for an Oscar for Bob & Carol, Ted & Alice and MASH.

It’s as if this character and the alter ego of his other character, Bob (from Bob & Carol, Ted & Alice) who “insists that everyone “feel” rather than intellectualize their emotions”208 had been to the Red Dog Saloon to learn how. Starting in July of 1969, the filmmakers of Getting Straight took advantage of Lane Community College’s almost-open new school to film it in. My friend Mike Dilley was hired as a stunt man, and starred during the “protester’s riot scene.” And my South Eugene High fellow thespian Julie Anne Robinson was cast as a girl driving a VW Bug. How would an uncredited lowly extra like Julie Ann, in this film, get cast as Jack’s Nicholson’s co-star just a few years later in King of Marvin Gardens? It probably had to do with Richard Rush, a long-time collaborator with Jack as director on Thunder Alley and Hell On Wheels for AIP, as Director/Producer on Getting Straight. It’s really not what you know, it’s who you know. And I always wondered what had changed Rafelson and Nicholson’s minds about “just stopping for lunch” at Denny’s for Five Easy Pieces and instead shooting here for 5 whole days. And I am pretty sure it was because of Laszlo, the Cinematographer on Five Easy Pieces, who had also just filmed Getting Straight. I think he knew Eugene by then and wanted to show Jack around, because Jack was location scouting for Drive, He Said. The production Getting Straight lived and breathed at LCC. Most of the community didn’t even know they were there. Except Warren Merrill, the Oregon Governor’s Film Commissioner, because he got them their permits and had a scene in the movie. So now we also know who had his home phone number and why Warren Merrill was “conveniently available” on a Thanksgiving Dinner Night when Jack was in town for Five Easy Pieces. No doubt Laszlo called him, to give him a head’s up about another production in town needing some government perks like dinner and rooms at the Eugene Hotel. Laszlo was no fool.

He had been here with director Richard Rush on Getting Straight and knew Warren quite well. And knew he had a fat wallet for filmmakers. This Chapter on 1971, actually began in 1970 (kind of like an Academic Year) but it philosophically belongs here; in that my political life at the U of O with my dormmates soon ended after the protests at Johnson Hall; but my cultural life at The EMU was just really beginning. I wanted to do more than just protest, and so I made a commitment to help the struggling Black and American Indian Student Unions. One other way I had hoped to help was by volunteering to be on the UO Student Court. After I saw how Kip Morgan and David Gwyther were railroaded, I thought this might be a positive thing I could do. For instance, the Emerald published a photograph of David Gwyther cleaning up a mess that protestors made on the EMU Free Speech Platform, and they instead captioned it “Dav (sic) Stokes Fire.” In a campus newspaper article, the photograph below is captioned “Court Juror Proclaims Victory.” That is Tommy Anderson, of the Black Panthers. Dr. Ed Coleman asked me to mentor him, because he was having trouble with poetry in his English classes, that might endanger his affirmative action grant. Evidently, Dr. Ed felt I could help Tommy, because I could speak in a Bicultural way. I was raised both on and near an American Indian Reservation, which had a major train switchyard, with a large Black community that worked there. I had a best friend, Brenda Moore, a beautiful Black girl in Junior High, until she moved away. And my long-time “babysitters” were Hispanic and Black as a child. Eugene was much different. But I was clueless to that, as I had never paid much attention to someone’s race. That’s what happens when you come from an integrated multiracial town on an Indian Reservation where everyone is poor. The poor have to pull together to survive. Poverty is a great equalizer. In an interview with Lyllye Reynolds-Parker, for whom the new University of Oregon Black Cultural Center is named; and whom, for years, was part of our Chief Joseph 7 Drum Circle; revealed she is also “bi-cultural.” Her father told her they were not only Black, “but Blackfoot-Choctaw.” My dear friend Dewayne Jessie, who played “Otis Day” in Animal House is American Indian as well as Black.

I too, am “mixed race,” and I use that term because there is no other, except bicultural, and because my Elders say, “You are not part Indian. What part? You are either Indian or you are not.” I identified as an Indian since I was 5 years old, when I lived in Chiloquin; and I identified with those at the EMU, people like Lyllye, Dewayne, Ed Edmo and last but not least Gordon Bettles, who was in my Mom’s 3rd grade class at Chiloquin. It just occurred to me that Lyllye and I have both found our way to Dr. Reverend Michael Beckwith’s and Chief Joseph’s teachings. What are the odds? The Wailers, I was going to see Buddy Guy with my girlfriend Edie Keifer, who was also a big fan like me, of the Blues. And somehow, we were invited on the “Chitlin” tour with Buddy, which back then meant that the promoters found you a place to stay that was centrally located, (like Eugene) and then you would venture out in many directions to other gigs each day for a week or so. I remember us riding with him and A.C. Reed, Fred Below and others in a white van, drinking Lemon-Hart Rum, going with them to the concert at Reed College in Portland, and being treated like Queens, because they knew we both loved the music so much. Matrix in San Francisco. We also went to Albertine’s in Berkeley for lunch. When the three of us white girls walked in, the whole place went quiet. Now I know where that scene from Animal House came from; just like when the Delta Tau Chi “Animals” walked into the Dexter Lake Club, and Otis pretends he doesn’t see nor hear them. The Klamath’s and the Modoc’s did the same thing in Chiloquin. One day I was walking down the sidewalk from school, and two 7th grade girls who were in my Dad’s class pretended they didn’t see me, a mixed breed, and knocked me off the sidewalk. The 1000-yard stare is part of it. They won’t even recognize you with a flick of their eyes. It’s as if you never existed, which fits with their belief system that what they focus their minds on becomes reality. You aren’t there, you never were there.

This particular behavior is also what I have seen regarding other instances of my tribes’ practice of Quantum Mechanics. My best friend Etta, a Wallowa Band Nez Perce, had a mother named Elsie who could make the weather change with this practice, on laundry day. Etta said sometimes she had to “shoo them, the clouds, away.” And she Etta’s tribe, under her Great Uncle Chief Joseph, and Etta’s great grandfather Alikut, the War Chief; were also known as the Dreamer Society. They did not want to go onto a reservation in Idaho, nor to go to war with the whites for not complying with General Oliver Otis Howard’s order to do so in 1877; so instead they embarked on a 1700-mile trek to find political asylum with Sitting Bull in Cana- da. Allegedly they are documented by the US Calvary being able to create fog banks on hot July summer days to hide behind, and when surrounded by the Army, escaped from their tipis by shapeshifting themselves into horses, which they knew the Army would never shoot, as they were prized Appaloosas, that the US Army wanted badly as war booty. And that is how they escaped to fight another day. The biggest reason they refused to go on the reservation was because they knew that they would have to abandon their culture and religion and “assimilate” the white man’s culture. They felt they needed to keep their religion hidden away. This is why I have adapted the term “Marrano” to apply to this syndrome of the American Indian and the Black man, and any other people of color who have had their own religions overtaken by Christianity as discussed below: Having learned from Scholem’s studies that there is an elective affinity between Lurianism and Marranism, Derrida – obliquely and allusively – calls this heterodox lineage “Marrano” after the experience of the Spanish and Portuguese conversos, forced to convert to Christianity but keeping their Judaic faith undercover or, in the secret imitation of the Lurianic God, “in retreat.”210 It is precisely the Marrano “secret” – almost forgotten, bordering on a theology or even atheism, yet at the same time, not without its own irregular form of piety and memory – that offers the aptest model for the “religion of modern times.”211 Just as the Marrano encrypts the Jewish deus absconditus in the inner crypt of his seemingly impious self, so does the modern faith hide behind the façade of knowledge and develops further (FK, p. 53),212 undercover and in secrecy.

Knowledge, therefore, not only represses faith in the (once) Living God, but it also protects faith in the second source of the messianic retreat. This alternative, fides abscondita, is not to be dragged out from the shadow of the crypt into the light of presence: if it develops and becomes a new “religion of the new times” (der neuzen Zeiten), it is only thanks to the darkness of the “desert in the desert,” which is its hiding place. The hiddenness is the necessary condition of its survival. 213 Today we have a Longhouse at the University of Oregon, and one also at LCC. It was the one at LCC, where our Elder Roy Hayes had led the 7 drum Washat Ceremony when it started to outgrow Betsy and Dave’s house in Cottage Grove. I’ll never forget the first time I met him, at a Root Feast down near the Rodeo Grounds. I was lost, trying to find it, and saw a Tibetan woman with her scarlet Buddhist Robes carrying a potluck dish marching down the street. Spirit told me to stop and talk to her, and sure enough, she was heading to the Root Feast, too, which turned out to be a long walk. I gave her a ride even though I did not speak her language, nor her mine; but somehow we knew what each other was saying. She was Tibetan in a White Community, and we both spoke a bicultural metalanguage. Evidently she loved the Drums and the Bells which spoke a universal one. Could this be because each of the 7 drum songs come from each of the 7 stars of the Big Dipper? Music has always been a Universal Language. And in the 60s it became paramount, because it not only had minor pentomics and healed us, but it expressed our feelings and gave us names for them. Names for feelings that had been lost for over 100 years in the Age of Reason. So, I ended up there that day because a mutual friend wondered why I was driving 8 hours one way to attend the Washat Ceremony in the Wallowas; when there was one she knew of in Cottage Grove. And that is how I met my new tribe, and where I met Lyllye. She and I would sit together at Powwows and harmonize in Minor Pentomic with the songs.

Recently, I asked to interview her about her experience in the EMU, because I knew she knew Tommy Anderson; and it was Lyllye who told me that Tommy had become a professor after he left the U of O and the Black Panthers. And that he had passed away. Lyllye also said that her brother, Sam, returned to college after he had been in the service, and after he was placement tested they enrolled him as a second term Junior at the U of O! “He also heard the call from the Bay Area.” she said. But it was the call to join the Civil Rights Movement. One day Sam invited her to go with him to Oakland, California, for a Civil Rights Conference in the early sixties. They rode with our Poetic Cinema Hero Ron Finne, who was driving. Lyllye said they were run out of Medford in a racially motivated attack. That didn’t stop Finne, who would later join Haskell Wexler and eleven other Cinematographers for a March on Washington documentary, riding on a bus with an inter-racial couple. That was very likely because of Sam. Sam had also been the first to encourage Tommy and Howard Anderson to return to Eugene with him to help integrate the community. Lyllye had gone to Sheldon High School and graduated in 1964, five years before me in the first graduating class. She returned to the U of O at 40 years of age, as her children were preparing to graduate from high school. “I wanted to be their role model, she said.”214 But back in the early 60s, as she debated in a High School debate contest at the U of O, she said there were not a lot of inter-mingling of races. However, she said, it was a start, a beginning of “the Demographics of Diversity.” And because they all shared the same space at the EMU, it was “a hub-bub of socializing.” It was then, in the 60s, that the EMU Cultural Forum started putting on amazing music shows in the EMU Ballroom, which rivaled even the incredible Foreign, Experimental and Avant Garde Film showings at 150 Science, that I believe had been growing in popularity since 1951, when the famous Maya Deren, an experimental filmmaker, visited campus.

I can’t help but wonder if my father’s childhood friend, James Ivory attended any of these, the same year he graduated from the U of O in 1951. And sure enough, by 1956, the U of O Campus Film Group was officially formed by the Depts. of Speech and Drama, the Art Museum Desk and the School of Architecture and Allied Arts, also known as the “UO Film Society (which) is organized to present ‘unusual’ foreign, classic, documentary and experimental films on campus.”215 Professor Bill Cadbury showed his film classes at the U of O in 180 PLC starting in 1970. The community was invited to attend, and did we ever. Lynn Peterson remembers her husband, Gregg Thurlow Weed and her selling tickets at the door for Professor Cadbury.217 Little did we know that one day soon, Gregg, Lynn and I would soon form our own showings. More about that in the Chapter on 1974. In the meantime, in my own life, the Spring of 1970 had come, and I was worried how I would be able to stay in school without financial aid. I couldn’t go home again. It’s true you can never go home again after you have seen the world. And while Philip, my future husband and his sister traveled the world, literally; I had traveled the interior-world on a Psychedelic Bus, in the foreign films of 150 Science, and by road trips (even hitch-hiking!) to San Francisco to the world of music found there. And that is when my former student teacher from High School, Jay Wilson, re-entered my life in a big way. First it was a trip to San Francisco to see Crosby Stills, Nash & Young in the late Fall of 1969, then I brought him home to meet my Mom at Christmas. He started working at the Sun Shop Record Store on Campus, and I started hanging out there. Summer was coming and he invited me to live with him on a Commune out Dillard Road, on a back road to Kesey’s (in Pleasant Hill) from South Eugene, where the U of O was. And I got a job, thanks to my best friend in High The commune had 16 people living in a 2-bedroom shack with one bathroom. The owner was one of Jay’s best friends from High School, with his wife, Ginger, who had just graduated from Northwestern University with their Masters degrees in Political Science.

Tom was an intellectual, and invited his friends from New York, as well as their “gang,” including Jay and Tom Evans from high school. I spent a lot of time in the barn, weaving hangings and firing up a welding torch and sculpturing sheet metal on Purple Haze from Owsley. When I ran out of sheet metal, we started using the torch on giant candles, that we had poured multi-colored wax into. The mold was made from giant bulk Ice Cream containers. So we would let it cool, strip the waxy container off, and then torched the sides of the candles like sculpturing until some colors were revealed. I wasn’t doing very well in school, needless to say. No one had a job, but me. And the partying and music and day trips to Fall Creek took their toll. We had a car we had hidden LSD in, and forgot. One day it started spitting out Orange Sunshine LSD tabs from the air vents. But besides this manna from heaven, we were not doing well financially; so we decided to open a record store called Sherwood Forest, in one of the two storefronts of the Mayflower theatre, of course, right next to Stage I women’s clothing store, and around the corner from Block III men’s store. The theater had been catering to the College Crowd since 1950 evidently, when I found that the “Foreign Movie Club sponsor(ed) film screenings at the downtown Mayflower Theater, and boast(ed) a membership of 1,150.”218 Both of the clothing stores were showcasing very high-end fashion styles from the big cities; and The Black Panthers and their girlfriends loved them. They would also come into the record store, and order obscure, (to us) music. We soon got a reputation for being really great at that (The Jazz distributor was in Berkley) and were honored one day when one of our customers brought in a Shrine to Rashad Roland Kirk. It was an elaborate Victorian electric chair with wires and Rashad’s dedication on a Brass Plaque at the top. If you look at the left of the poster, made by artist Paul Ollswang, you can see a dog that has a name tag. Larry the Dog kept peeing on the racks when customers came in, so the owner, Mona gave him to me when he was about 2 years old.

And away from the madding crowd I did better at school, for just that term. However, later we kept being lured to San Francisco for shows, and would stop and get the records for our store on our return. We had also found a great cold-water dye place in Berkley, and I would stock up on earring supplies for the weekends, when I sat behind the counter at the record store and made earrings. The candle making was by then delegated to Fast Eddie, from the commune; but I would drop acid and listen to Debussy in the basement, while I painted cold water dye onto elaborate lace tablecloths we found from the Victorian era, at the Goodwill shop just 3 blocks away. The Motley Hotz Band, that played at Jay’s and my Wedding party in April of 1971, practiced in the basement. In the meantime, Kesey had rented a house just 2 blocks away, on 10th and Jefferson and called it “The Film House.”219 Rumiako the Parrot lived there, as well as Zodiac, and Roy Seburn. Ken was writing and financing a film called Atlantis Rising at the time with the Merry Pranksters Bobby Miller and Bobby Steinbrecher. If you take even just a cursory look at the UO Knight Library’s itemization of the Ken Kesey Collection, you will see that he made more attempts to create films than he did novels. From 1954 to the day he died, he was a true filmmaker. I only saw Atlantis Rising once, years later. And it was the most incredible poetic film I have ever seen. Zodiac on the right plays the Joker, the Fool, and as a symbol, still rides on the bus as a hood ornament. Kesey was playing a Merlin-esque character. Here is a link to what remains to be seen. https://vimeo.com/82658257. However, at the time, the Film House was off limits for visitors and was a place for him to work. Yet once in a while we would go out to the farm for a special gathering such as watching Kesey’s latest edit of the bus footage, but the bus footage made me seasick. So I would go out on the deck outside the barn for some fresh air, and Ken would follow me out. He just sat next to me for a long time. He did that almost every time I would see him.

Then one particular time he quietly said : “I have a feeling we are going to be friends for a very long time.” And he was right. We were, over 32 years. While Kesey was making Atlantis Rising, our record store was failing in the Fall of 1971. And I was nearly failing school, too, at the U of O. I spent too many days missing class to go to Berkeley with Jay to get records for the store, timed around incredible concerts in the Bay Area, like the Jefferson Airplane, and The Who; in addition to the Rolling Stones in Seattle. During that year at the U of O, I got three Incompletes and two No Passes. I can still tell you which concert I attended for each one of those grades, and they were all missed finals scheduled at the same time as the Concerts. But it was time to change our bad habits. So Jay negotiated a deal to merge with the Sun Shop on Campus. And I buckled down and brought my grades way up in the Spring of 1972. The record store had provided us with a silver lining, and that was that our friend Steve Bove from Sheldon High School, whom had been living at the record store, was listening to the Mayflower’s movies through the walls at night; and had begun to make friends with the manager. Before we knew it, he was booking films there, and so we let him move into our basement, where we could all continue to work on realizing a dream of having our own movie theater someday. While Jay was at work, Steve and I would listen to Debussy as we painted old Victorian tablecloths with cold-water tie-dye; and talked about film. The object of this study therefore is to demonstrate that obscenity is not simply a cultural aberration but that it is a complex expression of human imagination, humanistically vital enough to have its own poetics. – Professor Peter Michaelson, The Aesthetics of Pornography t is said that Erica Jong’s book, Fear of Flying started the second wave of Feminism: “Fear of Flying is a 1973 novel by Erica Jong which became controversial for its portrayal of female sexuality and figured in the development of second-wave feminism.”220 But I say it started first in the film industry, not in publishing.

Famous Film Critic Roger Ebert, (who even worked with XXX Russ Meyers) would tell you that our generation was very sophisticated when it came to film, and it is why we created such great art. We had our finger on the pulse of sex, too. Just ask Stan Brakhage. Or check out Maya Deren. And, for us second or third generation “liberated women;” (whom like our Grandmothers, that worked during World War II, like Rosie the Riveter; or our Mom’s, who were their daughters, whom chose to work) we were really unsatisfied with the Post World War II movies that weaponized women in Noir films, where the femme fatal is sexually alluring but dangerous;221 or the movies that were constantly depicting John Wayne riding into town as the Archetypal American Cowboy, solving the community problem, finding the town girl, loving and leaving her, and riding off into the sunset. The bigger the male hero in the doorways of film, the smaller the women’s presence seemed to become. We were just shadows now, kept in the cave, reminiscent of The Searchers, like Natalie Wood. Hollywood didn’t seem to know what to do with us. The Madonna/Whore complex needed to be reconciled. In the Noir film genre mentioned above, women were wearing giant shoulder pads and pants, and the gun was symbolic of a phallic heterogeneity. Some of us multi-generational liberated women were, as Helen Reddy stated “[W]omen who had been initially turned off by some of the more strident feminist voices; or women who believed they were already liberated.”222 I was one of the latter. My mother, who looked like Marilyn Monroe, and dressed just like her, had a Master’s Degree in Special Education. She raised me to believe women were very powerful. And to understand sexuality as a healthy way to express desire. As for the John Wayne movies, that Archetype was DEAD, along with the Patronymic GOD. Besides, by then, that Male archetype had gone Baroque in order to rationalize the U.S.’s hegemonic Foreign Policy.223 As televisions invaded American living rooms and audiences were less apt to go out to the movies, movie ticket sales plummeted; it was only one of many factors that threatened the film industry.

As a screenwriter, she is best known for her work in The Big Sleep (1946), Rio Bravo (1959), and Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back (1980).225 Later, after he met her, Hawks thought Leigh Brackett was a good writer because, according to him, she wrote “like a man.”226 Well, this “man” wrote Hawk’s trilogy of the New Westerns so beloved by Cineastes: Rio Bravo, El Dorado, and Rio Lobo. And there were always lots of women. But it was Rio Lobo that she wrote, that created the first “New Age Western Film” with real women protagonists.227 Howard Hawks is my favorite director. Some of his classic films, Scarface, Twentieth Century, Bringing Up Baby, Only Angels Have Wings, His Girl Friday, Sergeant York, To Have and Have Not, The Big Sleep, Red River, Gentlemen Prefer Blondes and Rio Bravo span five decades; telling the stories of the disenfranchised so well that the national consciousness was ready for Rio Lobo in the early 70s. From sympathetically portraying the disenfranchised gangster, detective, show girl and drunk; his favorite screenplay writer then provides him with a major issue of the day, how to depict the disenfranchised woman as an archetypal western hero. Leigh Brackett was known as the “Story Queen of Space Opera.” I don’t even think our heroine of Princess Leia would have even been born in Star Wars, without her. And don’t tell me that George Lucas didn’t know what he was doing by taking Leigh’s somewhat masculine name, and created Leia, a more feminine homage to her.228 Not long after this film was made, I met John Wayne at a Premiere for Cahill, U.S. Marshall in Seattle. He had just been in a fistfight with some Indians who were protesting the portrayal of their people in his movies. It really was right after the American Indian Movement took over Alcatraz. And it wasn’t pretty. His toupee was ruffled. But he won my heart anyway, (albeit an Indian heart, which was, truthfully, on their side) after complementing me on my dress. “I like the way you look in that dress, little lady.”", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634243568_cleaned.txt:98:6e0c0296b621", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 1526, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634243568_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634243568", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634243568_cleaned", "chunk_index": 99, "text": "for Cahill, U.S. Marshall in Seattle.

But he won my heart anyway, (albeit an Indian heart, which was, truthfully, on their side) after complementing me on my dress. “I like the way you look in that dress, little lady.” he drawled. Actually, I don’t think it was the dress; it was what wasn’t on underneath the dress. It was the 70s. Or maybe because, from across the room, we were heads above most people there, and I was 23 years old and 64^(′) in my stacked heels. But by then film snobbishness had already kept me from seeing Rio Lobo, and it wasn’t until I was attempting to write an existential screenplay in the early 90s that I ever took John Ford seriously. And John Ford led me to landscape films, and landscape films led me to Yakima Canutt, who was in dozens of films from the Lone Star Studio in Texas with John Wayne as his nemesis; a bad guy in a black hat on screen, but then, with a white hat, he also doubled for Wayne as a stuntman. I once heard that Yakima was so much a personal inspiration to Wayne that the star adapted his swagger. Yakima later became a second unit director and was also from the Northwest, a cowboy hero of the Pendleton Round-Up, the heart and landscape subject of my best screenplay. Not even then did I see Rio Lobo, however. It wasn’t until I went back to film school 20 years later, a dream of mine, (even after being in the business for decades) and was re-introduced to Director Howard Hawks’ Rio Bravo that I saw John Wayne again. I was a fan of Hawk’s work, he had been a staple at Cinema 7, a film art-house I was a part of in the mid to late 70s, but our back-room discussions were limited by Pauline Kael’s reviews, and my onset film vocabulary. Attending film school in my late 50s armed me with some tools of critical analysis. And studying Rio Bravo with them gave me an appreciation for two actors I felt (as a casting director) were just cultural celebrities: Dean Martin and John Wayne. Urban legend even has it that John Ford was rumored to say to Howard Hawks: “I didn’t know the Big Lug ( John Wayne) could act,” meaning Hawks was the better director. I hadn’t seen.

I had read the reviews, I wasn’t expecting much, but to my surprise and delight, it held me spellbound, and at the double-barreled second act turning point, it snared me. I was going, “No, no, this can’t be the answer to the existential questions I had been asking my whole life!” My angst had been underscored years ago by a short story written by film academic and writer Bill Kittredge in his book Owning It All; and the story was aptly called “Silver Bullets”: It’s an old, smoked, and seasoned American scenario: rescue by heroes come from our wilderness, cowboys and mountain men, Shane and George S. Patton, Big John Wayne from the Monument Valley, Deerslayer after Deerslayer defending us from dark tides, bad dreams, savages, and bankers. Our sweet farmstead family-centered life will last forever, so the implications go, if we simply trust such horsemen to defend our property and our virtue. Heroes are an ancient problem. There is the cutting quickness of violence, the warfare so elementally ended, and then what? The good hero, Shane, rides away into the mystical Tetons and is never heard from again. Who was that masked man, why did he leave this silver bullet?229 I told Director Monte Hellman about this interesting existential film theory called the “Silver Bullet theory” one day while discussing Walter Hill’s quote: “All my movies are Westerns. Even Aliens.”230 It was electrifying to read these words that challenged my beliefs in the sacred mythology of the western, because, Indian or not, my heroes had always been cowboys. Kittredge goes on to say: “Our society had grown up believing in heroes who would come riding in to save us, and now we found ourselves in a society that wasn’t worth saving. Our mythological story was a horseshit excuse for bad conduct…”231 I grew up in the rugged west, not far from where Kittredge grew up, and our Grandfathers were friends. Dennis Cozzalio is also from that High Desert landscape near Klamath Falls, Oregon, the former Cowboy and Indian murder capital of the world. And we grew up on Westerns: The Lone Ranger, Have Gun Will Travel and The Rifleman. All which told a similar archetypal story, the sexy lone gunman coming into a community and solving its problems, then leaving again, never marrying, unsuccessful at joining the community, breaking young women’s hearts, aloof, above the law; but before riding off, creating a new fertile Spring in a dark land, almost like the mythical Fisher King.

For me, it was James Fennimore Cooper’s character “Hawkeye” that first epitomized this archetype of American Literature. Half civilized American colonial/British subject, half Indian, he came from civilization but embraced the wilderness. An early Jeremiah Johnson, he was the Poster Child for rugged individualism, the precursor to Daniel Boone and Davy Crockett, a man who thought for himself, and we loved him for it. He was an ethical anti-establishment pioneer, a hybrid of cultures that were necessary to tame the West. As a 1970’s filmmaker, I was amazed to learn a new language in film school. I was able to articulate why I was drawn to John Ford’s films, the sensibilities I resonated with but wasn’t conscious of until I had the language to express 70s ideals such as his exquisite eye for composition, but especially the relationship of humans to the landscape, which were in proportion to their importance to Mother Nature, and that was not so terribly important in the scheme of things. Like an Andrew Wyeth painting, humans were rarely in the foreground of the drama. Desert heat, lack of water, thunder and lightning causing stampede’s, floods, barns on fire, smallpox, threatening Indians appearing high on a cliff, all were more powerful than the average citizen, who needed a larger than life savior. Technology has not only changed that proportion, but the technological advent of the Television made it nigh impossible to portray. Give me Cinemascope any day! Now we watch films on Smart-phones, and it is comical for me to hear a set designer say, ‘I know you can’t see any of my set, but darn it, you can feel it on the screen!” I like to think it is something that Director Howard Hawks would say to me, now that I have, perhaps foolishly, turned down financing from locations with the wrong landscape, for a screenplay about Chief Joseph’s people, the Nez Perce. I’ll never forget financiers trying to convince me that Luxemburg’s Black Forest could stand in for the Big Empty Steeps and the Glacial Moraines of the Wallowa Mountains, also called the “Alps” of America. Never-the-less, in Rio Lobo (1970) Howard Hawks has left us with a new kind of film and in its Joseph Campbell way is a True Hero(ine)’s Journey; a film that has not only saved me from my existential sadness for the emerging culture, but has re-invented the archetype for the new age, to survive the new", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634243568_cleaned.txt:101:6f048ef7a433", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 1529, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634243568_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634243568", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634243568_cleaned", "chunk_index": 102, "text": "Black Forest could stand in for the Big Empty Steeps and the Glacial Moraines of the Wallowa Mountains, also called the “Alps” of America.

And he did it by doing what he always did best in his films, which was to explore the hidden story of the disenfranchised. From Scarface, to Diamonds Are a Girl’s Best Friend to Rio Bravo Hawks would take the stereotypical gangster, dumb blonde, drunk, etc. and by exploring their reality with the camera, would turn the stereotypes in on themselves and hit us unsuspectingly with them, making them humane, brilliant, gallant and heroic, all at the same time, our anti-heros. He does this in Rio Lobo, his last film, but this time he tackles the whole genre and archetype of our white-hatted Westerns and their heroes. And creates “The New Age Western” in its place. Let’s see how this could possibly be true by unpacking it: Rio Lobo (River of the Wolf) and I am begging to say, “Lone Wolf ’, because, sure enough, there is a Lone Wolf bad guy. The credits open with a man playing a Flamenco guitar, and we see different perspectives of his hands as he plays. When we see his fingers playing from the perspective of We then see Yankee soldiers in brand new serge suits. A kind of Corporate Armani of Wall Street look in a dirt floor town. A horse drawn wagon pulls up in front of a building with exquisite stone arches and at the same time we see a train pull up through these arches. Here we have the old uncivilized west symbolized by the old wagon, and the new civilized west symbolized by the train, like a visible double entendre. The soldiers carry a very heavy chest (we are told it is full of gold) from the wagon to the train. We see arches throughout the film, almost as if the mise-enscene is trying to emulate church windows, so we have some indication we are seeing through them a spiritual or morality play. John Wayne’s stature was frequently measured by doorways in Ford’s films, and Hawks also measured him from the tips of his boots, up, in a long camera tilt in Rio Bravo. But here, he is standing next to another soldier who is his same height. The camera angles shooting down on him also continue to make him look short in comparison! The premise of the film is set up.

Confederate rebels have been stealing gold from the Yankees. In the classic shot from the inside of the telegraph office looking out on the train, we are privy to the guarded telegraph communications. The next thing we see in a cut are drab and dingily costumed good old boys with a southern drawl listening in on some kind of homespun technology to the wires. The old-ear-to-the-rail trick tells them the train is coming, and they pull off a simple but ingenuous heist using hornets and rope. In the hold-up, a favorite soldier of John Wayne’s is hurt, but we don’t stop to dwell on it as we are led on the chase. And the chase leads to Wayne being knocked out and he comes to in a cave. Guess which cave? That’s right, and it wasn’t the cave so much as what shadow of memory had previously happened in it, because we are conditioned by this western objective correlative to witness redemption; and sure enough, the enemies spar with humor and the Prisoner Wayne good-naturedly tests their intelligence, revealing the good old boys as smart, articulate, and good-humored. And one of them is an Irish/Mexican from New Orleans, talk about being disenfranchised! But wait! Not only are they breaking stereotype, but they have switched clothing, as if the ghost of Natalie Woods had stripped her Indian clothes for a Pinafore, to make her Uncle see who she really was underneath all of his stereotypical Injun-hating judgments. By using these same sets as The Searchers, Rio Bravo, and El Dorado Hawks is juxtaposing the old archetype with the new one, creating a conflict between the old story trajectory and the new unknown one. He also creates a depth of character in Wayne by having him wisely seeking the person behind the robberies, an informer from his own troops, instead of punishing the men beneath him for carrying out the bad guy’s orders. “What you did was war, what he did was Treason.” Wayne goes so far as give them a chance to escape, but they remain there out of a sense of duty, and there is honor among thieves. Hawks also turns the table on our expectations, by using a storm as a positive elliptical device, and when the storm clears, the Civil War is over, and we watch the Rebels as they are given clothes and food and money.

Wayne also buys them a drink, tells them he is still looking for the man who hired them, and asks where they are going. When one of them says Rio Lobo, Wayne gives him extra money, and tells him he needs it to get there. He also tells them he is from “those-near-abouts” and if they ever run into the traitor, to find him here. Irish Mexican falls for her, exacerbating the conflict between the romanticism of the Old West and the self-reliant sexiness of a Gloria Steinem in Tombstone circa turn of the century. But wait, there’s even more! Once in Rio Lobo we find a whole town governed by a bad man, a “rabid wolf.” The Mexican women there, too, are liberated, however; and a really brave and smart one has a Spanish accent, while her two good friends, pretty Jennifer O’Neill and Sherry Lansing, have good old masculine-American true grit! By now, the bad guy’s gunman has discovered they are all in town, and issues the proverbial “gone by sunset” ultimatum, but by that time they are way ahead of him, and are out to get the deeds to the ranches back from his boss. To do that, they have to outwit a crazy Southerner who shoots first and asks questions later, unless of course the object to be shot at has nice ankles. Proving their worth, Jack Elam then takes them in because his rebel boy who’s being held in jail as a hostage had told his pa about the nice Yankee. Elam then leads them to the long-wanted Yankee traitor. Knowing they can’t out-gun all the henchmen, they take him at gunpoint to the jail, where Elam reprises the Walter Brennen role in Rio Bravo. They had taken this traitor bloodied and bruised to the jail, in order to also protect one of their own, a rebel, and to await justice in the form of the Yankee Military out-post near there. But the Irish American wouldn’t wait, and is caught by the bad guys riding hell-bent for leather to notify the Military Fort, so now they have a hostage trade-off instead. What also surprises us is that the women have been abused, but instead of relying on the Lone Ranger to avenge them, they avenge themselves.

All of this has led us to the third act climax turning point, where the set-up was true to form, in that the good guys were alone against the bad guys, and like every other Western, the town’s people were hiding, taking no risk or responsibility, except for a town hero or two, who always seemed to get shot. But this time, we see saloon doors beneath an arch, and instead of just John Wayne, we see him side-by-side with the community of the town. And it is shocking to see that the townspeople do stand next to him, and overcome the Bad Guy by working together, trusting each other, and not setting one apart to be the responsible one. A truly democratic and wise maneuver, it is not even Wayne who shoots the bad guy at a pivotal moment, but a woman. All’s she wants to know is that if every time she looks in the mirror (and would see his knife slice, a scar, like the ubiquitous x in Scarface on her face) she would know she did the right thing by killing the bad guy in the end. And the women’s relationship to the good guy is different too; Wayne is not seen as a potential sexual partner, a wild man, or a saver of virtue. He is called “comfortable” and is seen as safer than the romantic and handsome Irish/Mexican to these women. But when they do exact their revenge, it is Wayne who comforts them when they kill, and they do react dramatically. Wait! Was someone emotional? And with Intellect? Holy Cowgirl. And instead of being threatened by the woman stepping into the role of the hero, Wayne tells her if it wasn’t her, it would have been “somebody else,” telling her that she is not alone, has acted not as a lone representative, a lone wolf, but as a member of the pack, a member of society.

Like Otter said to Boon in Animal House, when Niedermeyer was taking liberties with a new ROTC pledge and was debriding him: “He can’t do that to our pledges … only WE can do that to our pledges!!!”233 Only Sharry Lansing could get away with that. But it was up to us women to find our voices and to interpret this New Age of Sexual Liberation. “Fear of Flying was written in the throes of the Sexual Revolution of the 1970s, as associated with second-wave feminism. Finally it was acknowledged that desire and fantasy are a good thing and not entirely condemnable in women, and Jong wanted to harness that newfound respect for desire into a piece of art that brought the intersections of sexual and nonsexual life together, something she felt was missing in literature. “At the time I wrote Fear of Flying , there was not a book that said women are romantic, women are intellectual, women are sexual – and brought all those things together.”[4] “What [Isadora is] looking for is how to be a whole human being, a body and a mind, and that is what women were newly aware they needed in 1973.”[5] But she also points out the drawbacks of a sexually liberated life, acknowledging that sexuality “is not the cure for every restlessness.” Male critics who interpreted Isadora as being “promiscuous,” were actually misinterpreting her acts - she has an active fantasy life but doesn’t in reality sleep with many men.”234 By Spring term at the U of O in 1972 college was excruciating.

I needed to get a job. The only bright spot was that actor Paul Newman was coming to the Oregon Coast to film Sometimes a Great Notion (which btw, only took six years to get funded as a film) and a Grateful Dead concert was coming in August. By this time Kesey and the boys had formed Far West Action Picture Service, and had rented an old airplane hangar to house all of their equipment. They ended up being invited to the set in Newport by Newman. There is a great “home video” of one of their visits. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVNG3IcUprY217235 is a sequel to. However, since then I have found several other wonderful quotes, the first I have mentioned by Director Walter Hill, when he said: “… every film I’ve done has been a Western;” and was elaborated on in another quote that “The Western is ultimately a stripped-down moral universe, that is whatever the dramatic problems are, beyond the normal avenues of social control and social alleviation of the problem, and I like to do that even within contemporary stories.”237 The other quote I found, one I mentioned by Dr. Corkin, may also illuminate thinking about Kesey writing the New Western. “(… writers) were trying to reimagine the Western as a vehicle for the any-establishment antihero. Paul Newman was a Hollywood leading man closely connected to this vision of character.” He was spot on as an Oregon Logger, too. But famous costume designer Edith Head would not let him wear a logger cap. If you remember, I pointed out that Jack Nicholson wore one for directing auditions in Drive, He Said; and he wore one in Cuckoo’s Nest. Over 30 years later, even the Twilight film cast wore them. What’s up with that??? What does this vision of the Oregon Anti-hero character entail? I think it is the modern version of the archetype of men making their way and surviving in the woods, but now as an Anti-hero for the New Age. Early on in the filming, Paul Newman got hurt. So while he was waiting to get the cast off of his foot to resume filming, Kesey and the boys got a job working with Sam Cutler, the Grateful Dead’s manager on filming the Springfield Creamery Benefit Concert.

The Creamery was another Kesey family contribution to the counterculture. Nancy’s Yogurt made them famous all up and down the West Coast. But because there was a threat from the IRS because back taxes were overdue, The Dead came to help. 10,000 people showed up to create what I call the Magnum Opus of all Grateful Dead Shows, and with the help of Kesey and his film crew, my friends Bob Laird; (Assistant Director) Lew Melsen; (Camera) Bobby Steinbrecher; (Camera) Bobby Miller; (Camera) Joey Valentine; (Production Assistant) Karen Price (Child Care) and me as an extra; this timeless event was captured on 16mm film. Not only that, but Producer Sam Field would fall in love with Kay Erskine, (a production assistant) who had just purchased the Flatbed Movieola for FWAPS; would eventually be married to her for 41 years while he tried to get this movie edited and distributed. Finally it came out in 2013. The Producer, Adrien Marin, of the incredible documentary about us back then in the opening of the film, would even escort me to the Premiere. In the same summer of 1972, our living situation with a friend was coming to an end. We found a place cheap enough about 45 minutes away on fire road, off of Siuslaw River Road, way past the tiny town of Lorane. The distance didn’t matter anymore, because I could not afford going back to school, anyway. But we were still showing films around town under Screen Gems, with Steve Bove at the helm; Jay was working at the Sun Shop; and Bobby Steinbrecher had called me, wanting me to do location scouting for him and the FWAPS gang for a Williams Bread Commercial. He needed a kitchen large enough for lights, a Panavision camera, and crew, but none could be found. I cast Ken Babbs to star in it, and a woman named Sharon Brown. Finally, I talked Bobby into allowing me to clean and set design an old Hippie Commune kitchen I found. It was beautiful, and I was so proud. That’s when Kesey told me his favorite thing ever was to ride around in his El Dorado Cadillac, with the top down, location scouting. Here are the before and after photos. Right after that, Hagen called me. He said a film was looking for people to work on it, and to meet him at the Eugene Hotel later that afternoon.

While I was meeting with them, the phone rang and it was Warren Merrill, the Oregon Film Commissioner, welcoming them to Oregon. I remember thinking, well that’s good, they must be legitimate. But then they asked me if I would take my top off for them. And I said absolutely not. But I would be a great gofer, and I could do hair, and makeup, set design and location scouting. I was hired, but they kept thinking I would relent and take my top off, but Hagen and the Pranksters knew better. I was a prude and had never done that before, no matter how much money they offered me. The film was called Street Girls, and it was written by the Barry Levinson, his first. He also was a cameraman. It was directed by Mike Miller, whom I became friends with. The story was set in LaMar’s, a topless go-go dancer club in the basement of the Tiffany Building two blocks from the Eugene Hotel. And that is when I started living there, because the worst ice storm inversion in Oregon History hit early that winter, and we couldn’t get home because of downed trees. And consequently our house froze. Luckily Jay could live with his Mom, and he took the dog; while I lived in the giant Ladies Room in the Basement of the Hotel. The film starred Jimmy Smith, the semi-famous musician, and some local girls. One night, I think it was the Martini shot, (the last shot of the film) there was a topless contest at LaMars. So I took my top off, and won the $25 for a 5-minute schtick. That’s when I realized why Hagen and Dan Webb and all these guys were paying me $25 an hour. If I had known better, I would have had “my girls” insured like Betty Grable did with her legs, even though I never showed them to anyone until now. But hey! It was the 70s and I was a liberated woman who wanted to be a filmmaker. And now I realized, I really was.

See the first page of the Introduction for the full image. For as long as I can remember, Ken Kesey threw The I Ching every day. And my ex-husband Jay and I threw it, too. For instance, Jay threw it before deciding to go to the infamous Altamont concert. It said, “armies in the night.” and we didn’t go. Thank God. This is why we consulted it. However, the language about The Receptive, Hexagram #2 is very, very similar to the above quotes regarding the “nurse of generation.” Carl Jung wrote the forward to the English translation of the I Ching by Richard Wilhelm that Kesey and I used. In it, he talks about how the I Ching works, and says it is simply a matter of synchronicity. Synchronicity is the Hallmark of the Age of Aquarius. If Quantum Mechanics ever finds how Gravity fits into Einstein’s Unified Field Theory, they will find how synchronicity works. For me, it is simple. If a butterfly winging in Taipei can create a Typhoon in the Gulf of Mexico; then truly everything is connected in a giant web governed by intelligence and cause and effect. The Word is Hexagram #1 , (Masculine) the Creative and cause; and the Receptive #2 (Feminine) is the effect. What this means to me, is the simple fact I was in the right place at the right time when I met the Pranksters, and ended up in film, which had set into motion a train of circumstances that I was receptive to, and in some degree, fated for, because it was Karmic: In the silent era, films were made mostly for women, and often by women.

From the contemporary movie magazines to respectable film history books, early female directors are regularly referred to as rarities – even when that was not the case. A woman directed what was probably the world’s first scripted narrative fiction film; in the mid-to-late teens the Universal studio was bursting with female directors. Women such as Lois Weber, Alice Guy-Blaché, Germaine Dulac, Lotte Reiniger and Mabel Normand were leaders in their respective fields, and they were supported by an industry filled with female screenwriters, and some hugely important female producers producing movies for a majority female audience. But you wouldn’t know that from textbooks that relegate “women in film” to a sidebar.239 I was paying my dues, yet not having to work from the ground up, literally, like I first did for the Pranksters; but by putting in 12 and 15 hours a day on Street Girls. It was originally called Angel Goes to Town, and I loved its writer, Barry Levinson. I should have known he was both a Writer and the Cameraman, because I remember how comfortable I was around him. He had a deep sensibility. I was terribly nervous in the first scene, shot at a dining room table, until he said, “just talk about anything, it will be great.” This acting job was far from the scripted plays I had done in high school, or filming with the non-synched ambient sound that I didn’t have to worry about with the Pranksters. For them, my whole career, I only had to say one line. “Hey, Joe, way to go…” for a Joe Romania commercial about Minivans. The commercial showed for years, evidently they sold a lot of vans. But Barry was so much like them, including being a bit frumpy, and with that 16mm camera on his shoulder, that I soon forgot he was even there. And I just acted naturally, like my drama teacher Ed Ragazzino at South Eugene had taught me. But before I knew it, they were gone, and suddenly there was another one starting called Swinging Sorority Girls. This one, however, did not credit anyone with their real name. And I am SO glad! I was offered $300 a day to just do make-up and hair, and a little acting to set up the scene (because there were no pros, except one guy from LA) and I soon found out why.

All the local guys evidently had a hard time “performing” on- camera. Like Gus Van Sant, I was just learning new skills on these films, but I made it clear that when it came to performing sex, forget it. Sex was a very complicated issue for me. At the time I did not know why, but around 5 years of sobriety in the early 90s, the memories came up. The subconscious memories I had drank and used over. Incest issues. And it contributed to why I couldn’t handle all the attention I was getting in High School. By College I finally figured out that I just needed to get married, to hopefully stave off the advances. However, I was just going through the motions. A part of me was still very detached. I felt like I was watching myself from the upper corner of the room. And this detached logic in me shrugged and said: Your professors didn’t really believe that a girl with your body could have a mind like the one they found in your papers, because they kept asking in- credulously, “Did you write this???” as if the size of your breasts shrunk your brain; so screw it, you might as well make some money off of them. And your body. The one you inherited from your Marilyn Monroe Mom. She’s proud of hers, so what’s wrong with you? It was complicated, but I moved ahead working on these films because I loved being a filmmaker. It was like this job was made for me. Luckily, in the beginning, for the most part, all the crew knew each other. They had to, because it was an underground production, and then we found people by word of mouth. Someone said there was a help-wanted ad for College Couples in the Emerald. I believed it, when I saw it, but I couldn’t believe how open minded they were about the whole thing. But the film crew and I were old film friends, so I felt right at home. Given the $1.00 an hour minimum wage, I made more then, in one day, than when I was working for a whole month at Bob’s Hamburgers in high school, because the money was under the table, and there were no taxes or fees taken out.

I just wasn’t sure if I believed in this or not. Part of me had embraced the free love ethic of our generation, I was in an “Open marriage,” a Commune based feeling of sharing and loving. I felt it wasn’t wrong to exercise my God-given powers. But the complicated part was that the incest made me feel as if somehow, as a child, I had betrayed someone. And the deep shame surrounding that marred my ability to understand myself, or to believe in “the God of my father,” who seemed, like my father, capable of wrath. My Mother was who I first worshipped, she even looked like a goddess. A Blonde and Blue-eyed Danish goddess. One whose beauty caused severe problems in her marriage to my Dad, as it was to cause in mine. But my husband was practicing a sort of Pygmalion on me; (he was my student teacher in high school) and then became the Arthur Miller to my Marilyn Monroe, my Prankster nick-name from Ken Kesey. Jay appreciated my intelligence, which is why I married him. He was also in San Francisco in the early sixties and was entrenched in their ideals. But he was also an accountant at heart, and $300 a weekend was a huge amount of money. And he never asked questions when I brought it home after filming all day. He was very pragmatic about it all. And I was very indigenous about sex. I would choose who and when. I also found it very humorous, and sacred. My girlfriends from the reservations and I would giggle about things my white girlfriends would never, ever, even talk about. Patriarchal sex is very different than Matriarchal sex. The first is about control, the second is about the joys of love and life. We filmed on the U of O Campus. You have to understand, that compared to what was normal in those wild days, this movie was TAME! I have a scene with a Professor that was so ho-hum I didn’t even remember I had done it. But you can imagine how I felt when I realized one of my professors at the U of O had seen it! Then a third film came, called Swinging Ski Girls.

But my girlfriend Lucretia stole the show, in a scene at Berg’s Ski Shop with Rick Cassidy, and the Film Director “Bob Gilbert” fell madly in love with her. Next thing I know, she and I were spending a lot of time at his place on 13th and Lawrence, because he wanted her and I to start writing the stories for these films. And we did. Twelve of them. Somewhere I read that one of the financiers of these films saw that making films for women by women was the future. But back then, we just took people at face value, and besides, we had a real repertoire film company back then too, who were happy to get the work, and didn’t care. When we made these films, we never dreamed they would see the light of day. We were told that they were only shown at the “Pussycat Theaters” in San Francisco. I knew there was a woman there, in “The City” as we called it, who showed quality erotica at her theater, Sutter Cinema. Her name was Arlene Elster, one of Janis Joplin’s best friends from high school, and was “one of us.” A Flower Child, who ran an international erotic film festival. Like her, because we were poetic cinema filmmakers, we couldn’t help but project a little art in our films. Now they call them the “Classical or Golden So far, my story is pretty bizarre for a woman who never wanted to be a filmmaker. And as time went on, and when all my poetic cinema films were lost, I never thought these films would still exist, either, until a few years ago. I had contacted an old acquaintance, Ken Fobes, the former Press Secretary for Oregon Governor Tom McCall; for a quote for Vol. I of this book, about how I became the liaison to the set for One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest in 1975. All these years later, he was researching the Adult Industry for a book, and had found me – on the Internet. Like all over the place. Imagine my shock when he also told me that it was the Producers of Cuckoo’s Nest who had recommended me to the Governor to replace the 86’d film commissioner. He also remembered that when he had called me in to meet with him, at the request of the Governor, his intention was for an informal", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634243568_cleaned.txt:114:57b7f5aed8c8", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 1542, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634243568_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634243568", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634243568_cleaned", "chunk_index": 115, "text": "these years later, he was researching the Adult Industry for a book, and had found me – on the Internet.

He also remembered that when he had called me in to meet with him, at the request of the Governor, his intention was for an informal interview for the recommended position on Cuckoo’s Nest. I had no idea. I thought he had called me in because at the time I was lobbying the Governor’s office for funding the Indigenous film crew. He also said I had mentioned working on 14 color motion pictures. And now he knew what 14 films I was talking about, because there I was, in them. Back in 1975, when he asked me about them, evidently I had told him. My first reaction was “Oh My God,” I am so glad I never participated in any real sexual encounters on camera. Just this last year, I found a Lobby Card with me on it. They made up anonymous names for us in postproduction. That’s me on the top part of the Lobby Card, with a photoshopped top on. Lucretia and I were now partners-in-film, since Cinderella Liberty; and close friends, but not lovers. However, we agreed that guys love the idea of two women together, so we simulated being lesbians. The first one was called Welcome Wagon Girls. And we women were the stars and the writers. We got to explore what we wanted to see on the screen. We were in control of the male gaze on our bodies. As a matter of fact, we reversed the roles. We became the gazers, and that was so incredibly strange, because it’s men for the large part who respond to visual stimuli, and women who respond to the emotional. We gave our audiences both, which made them rather poetic. It was such a hit, that headquarters asked for more from us. And then the word got out, and more people kept showing up to be a part of it. Evergreen, the local film company, processors of slides and high-end poetic cinema 16 mm film, now started processing these films. A local production company loaned their editor out to cut these films. And we cranked out six more films in half a year, before May; when I was discovered by a Hollywood director. “Pornography as a genre, is a literature of Eros – the formulation of love’s mythology. In classical cultures that formulation was by and large coherent, incorporated into religion and the mainstream of cultural life. In modern cultures that mythology has lost coherence, become obscene.

Phallic worship (or even curiosity) has become something to be oppressed, and consequently a source of shame.”240 “In modern cultures that mythology has lost coherence, become obscene…” is exactly what my generation and Yeats were talking about. But on an Easter Sunday shoot, we were introduced to a new kind of Phallic God, a Hollywood star: Johnny “The Wad” Holmes, who like an Easter Bunny brought all of us girls Easter gifts. And we shot a scene where two of the local actress/topless dancers argued about who got on top of him first. They kept saying, “No, after you…” to each other for so long the whole cast and crew broke out laughing. He really was that big. But I can’t say that most of us girls were not just a little bit curious. Johnny taught me a lot. I found it is imperative to an actress to have someone with some skill to bounce off of, in dialogue. And I had become so comfortable with Hagen and my friends as crew, that I had allowed myself to be photographed in the nude. In early May of 1973, my photographer Dan Webb, who was still paying me $25 an hour to model for him, disappeared, which he did off and on. Next thing I know, I am getting a phone call that I thought was a prank. Lucretia was at my house, no doubt we were getting ready to go somewhere, when the phone rang. I was in the tub, and she answered it for me. Then she came into the bathroom and told me a Hollywood director was on the phone and wanted me to be in his next movie, I said, “Yeah, right. It’s the Merry Pranksters. Hang up.” To make a long story short, it was Mark Rydell, the director of The Fox (‘67) The Reivers (‘69) The Rose (‘79) The Cowboys (72) and eventually On Golden Pond (‘81). He called back later that evening, a little chagrined. “Do you want this part or not?” he said. He was filming in Seattle, a movie called Cinderella Liberty, with James Caan, Eli Wallach, and Marsha Mason. He would buy me a plane ticket, send a limo to get me, put me up in the “Above the Line” Mansion on Queen Anne Hill, and pay me per diem and Screen Actors’ Guild wages. About $500 for one day’s work.

He told me that if I flew up the next day, I could attend as his guest, the Premiere of John Wayne’s Premiere of Cahill, U.S. Marshall. And I said yes. And that Premiere changed my life forever. As we arrived at the Red Carpet in the limo, John Wayne was in a tussle with some American Indian Protestors on the dais above the sidewalk that led into the theater. Marlon Brando had snubbed the Oscar’s just a few months earlier, by sending Sacheen Littlefeather to turn the Oscar down on his behalf, and to raise awareness about what had happened at Wounded Knee, when my friend Russell Means and other traditional Hunkpapa Sioux had occupied the small town to protest the rigged system on the reservation, where even the BIA was complicit in its extreme poverty. This was not long after American Indians had occupied Alcatraz. I remember now where I had seen one of the signs that was at the U of O Longhouse a few years ago. It said, “Caution: Hollywood Still Shooting.” I had seen it first on a protestor’s cardboard sign at that premiere. John Wayne was not happy. He took it personally, when it was really about how Indians were depicted. I think that seeing “Sonny Corleone” ( James Caan) get out of the limo stopped it. The Godfather was all the rage then. John Wayne’s attention was riveted away from the protester’s anyway, as Rydell was a dear old friend from The Cowboys, and after they hugged, we all went into the lobby. At the private reception, champagne flowed and Rydell soothed Wayne’s feathers. I was wearing a slinky floor length dress that Lucretia had loaned me, with matching stacked heels. I knew Wayne was feeling better when he sidled up to me and drawled all over me. How this changed my life was that for the first time I saw young American Indians with a Great Spirit instead of a broken one. I saw them stand for the Truth. And the truth is that the American Cowboy Archetype embodied by John Wayne as icon, was part of a dialectic where denigrating American Indians was what you did when you wanted to elevate the whites. And why do the whites need elevating? Because the people who will hate you the most are the people who have greatly wronged you.

And American Manifest Destiny, based on a 1492 Papal Bull called The Doctrine of Discovery, made it legal to take an Indigenous people’s land by putting a flag on it, and declaring the ownership in the name of the Queen and/or King; wherein you own everything, including the original people themselves. Furthermore, you call them savages and make them not human, not worthy, and deem them simply as chattel. That is how you rationalize your own behavior. And what is worse, is that you feel threatened by them and don’t know why. But as a bicultural I can tell you this … it was understandable that Rydell would side with his old friend that he directed in The Cowboys. But Wayne was threatened by the Indians, and later on in the shoot, Rydell was threatened by a Black extra I was talking to on the dock. Both the Indians and I, and the Black man and I, had a camaraderie that goes beyond skin color. We recognize each other as kindred spirits. It is a soulfulness I can’t quite explain yet, but I am beginning to think it is because we resonate vibrationally and even speak the same syntactical language. The white woman in me is totally confused by it and doesn’t understand it yet, either. But I think the threatening part of a lot of systemic racism is sexual. And deep down, besides the hidden guilt for generations of wrongful subjugation, is the knowledge that the White man’s way of worshipping money and going to any length to acquire more is coming to an end; and that got my nerve up, and asked him if he remembered why he had hired me sight unseen for that role in 1973, some 36 years before. He said he was attending a luncheon at the Seattle Film Conference with Vilmos Zsigmond, when a disabled man came up to them and just put a picture in front of them. Of me. And then he turned it over and said, “There’s her phone number.” Rydell had looked through Lola Holliwell’s Talent files in Seattle, but wasn’t happy, evidently. When he and Vilmos saw my photo, they went “HER.” It was a nude medium shot of me. And it launched my Hollywood Career. But back then, at first, I had to learn many things.

I had to learn how to get to the airport on time, and how to even fly in an airplane; which was my first, among these many other firsts: how to ride in a Limo, how to attend a Premiere, how to talk to a movie star, how to handle yourself when you first meet a Hollywood director, all in the same day. As I wrote in Vol. I; I missed the plane, hence missed the limo; which had to be sent again; and regarding limos, you are to sit in the back seat, not the front. You are to talk to a movie star only when talked to, at first; (easy for me because I really had a fear of talking too much and now, was terrified by the whole experience; especially since the limo driver let me know he didn’t appreciate having to drive twice in one day to SeaTac, so I didn’t want to say a word, anyway) and you especially are not to trip on the Turkish Runner and fall down on your face the minute you walk in the front door to meet the director. But it broke the ice, and everybody jumped up, concerned. I’ll never forget Rydell asking me if I was hurt. And when I said “No. Just mad.” everybody laughed, and we became instant friends. I guess that was my audition, because my role was not to be shot until the end of the film, a month later. And I was welcomed to stay as the film’s guest in the meantime. When Rydell asked me if there were any other girls like me in Oregon, ones experienced in film, he then told me to bring my girlfriend Lucretia up too, to be in the scene with me. And I did. During that summer that we worked in Seattle on Cinderella Liberty, Lucretia and I were cast in very small roles as “Dance Hall Girls.” The premise of this film was that a Navy Seaman ( James Caan) was stranded in Seattle when his ship left, and was waiting for the next time it arrived, in order to leave again. But in that short amount of time, he found himself falling in love with a hooker (Marsha Mason) who had a Mulatto son (Kirk Calloway). Sound Western? You bet. “Dance Hall Girls” instead of “Strippers. “The white Male” who comes into a situation to save The Whore with the Heart of Gold and her Mulatto, downtrodden son.” But with a twist.

The third act turning point consisted of the Navy Seaman, on Cinderella Liberty (allowed on shore until midnight) now that his ship had returned and was having to decide what to do before the ship left the next day; either try to make it with the hooker and create a family with her son (and go AWOL); or leave with the ship, like a good cowboy would do. This was the scene that I was in. An old Navy Salty Dog (Eli Wallach) had retired and was a “barker” in Post Alley for a “Girly Show”; and James Caan was keeping him company and hoping for some advice until “Lights Out,” when the Dance Hall Girls came out of the Stage Door to head home. Wallach tries to grab two of them for himself and Caan, but the girls don’t want to have anything to do with them. Essentially, the scene portrayed that not even “Strippers” wanted to have anything to do with them. And Caan decides he doesn’t want to be like Eli Wallach when he gets old. For this scene, the writer Darryl Ponicsan had the girls very scantily dressed in the script, with stacked high heels. The wardrobe woman, Rita Riggs (Marnie, The Birds) was faithful to the script, and dressed me as a stripper. But once on the set, Rydell took one look at me and yelled at her, and told her to put a full cape over me. And I did my scene, but it didn’t make sense anymore. James Caan was to decide that he didn’t want what Eli Wallach had, and would choose to stay and make a family, after realizing he didn’t want to grow old and be a barker in the alley, alone with sleazy Dance Hall girls who didn’t even want him. But now there was no motivation. The girls were not lascivious enough. The Male gaze was thwarted. And all of these statements by critic Laura Mulvaney came true, that broke the Patriarchal spell, because: “There was no gaining control and possessing of the woman within the diegesis,”241 “there was no voyeuristic fantasy,”242 There was no “watching in an active controlling sense, an objectified other,”243 There was no established “guilt” of the women.244 And my personal favorite, there was no being “tied to her place of bearer, not maker, of meaning.”245 Somehow, not being sexualized in that scene created an alternative meaning, one that created agency for women, and that was amazing", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634243568_cleaned.txt:120:271b99d72a9f", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 1548, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634243568_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634243568", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634243568_cleaned", "chunk_index": 121, "text": "Patriarchal spell, because: “There was no gaining control and possessing of the woman within the diegesis,”241 “there was no voyeuristic fantasy,”242 There was no “watching in an active controlling sense, an objectified other,”243 There was no established “guilt” of the women.244 And my personal favorite, there was no being “tied to her place of bearer, not maker, of meaning.”245 Somehow, not being sexualized in that scene created an alternative meaning, one that created agency for women, and that was amazing to witness. I think Marsha Mason had enlightened the director (who had previously made D.H. Lawrence’s The Fox) at the “Family Style” Sunday Dinners at our Crew Hotel (the Mansion on Queen Anne Hill) where we would dine and then sip Watergate Whiskey (that Eli Wallach had brought from D.C.) and talk politics and feminism. And Marsha Mason would reign with her keen intellect about Watergate, and Eli admired her for it, and she became my new heroine. But that wasn’t all. James Caan and his brother Ronnie and I stayed friends, and they would take me to The Whiskey a Go Go to dance when I was in town. Rydell and Zsigmond even brought me to LA. and took me out to dinner to fun places like Musso and Frank’s and introduced me to the very famous Hollywood Casting Director Lynn Stalmaster, which changed my life. Just like my disastrous entry into Rydell’s life, my first audition for Hollywood’s most famous Studio Casting Director of all time, Lynn Stalmaster the Master Caster, was a disaster. He was the Casting Director for many of Mark Rydell’s movies, and Mark had heard about and talked me into auditioning for the lead role in an upcoming 20th Century Fox film called Vrooder’s Hootch aka The Crazy World of Julius Vrooder (1974) with “star” Timothy Bottoms, one that Lynn was casting. On the plane down to Hollywood for the audition, I had flown with my girlfriend Lucretia, who had been with me in the scene with Eli Wallach and James Caan for Rydell, earlier that Spring in Seattle. And on the plane Lucretia had befriended some Execs next to us, and talked them into letting us stay at their place in Century City. They were heading to New York later that night on the Red Eye, so I thought that would be a great idea because it would save us both extra cab fare from LAX to Hollywood, and hotel lodging. The problem was, before my audition with Stalmaster later the next day, I had tried to kill two birds with one stone and had gone to another appointment with Marilyn Grabowski, a photo editor for Playboy Magazine on Sunset Blvd; and had accidently locked the key to the Century City apartment inside. When I got back there, and went to the front desk, the managers of the complex didn’t believe that Stuart", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634243568_cleaned.txt:121:16fce4b81c5d", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 1549, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634243568_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634243568", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634243568_cleaned", "chunk_index": 122, "text": "fare from LAX to Hollywood, and hotel lodging.

When I got back there, and went to the front desk, the managers of the complex didn’t believe that Stuart Diamond, the original apartment renter had ever given me a key, because it was against the rules to let people stay there that were not on the lease, especially without them there; and consequently wouldn’t let me in. I knew they wouldn’t let me go upstairs now, so I left the front desk to go out the main door with a toss of my long hair for effect (as in hmpf! “I am so insulted, I am leaving!”) and ran around the back to the parking garage and snuck up the back stairs to wait for Lynn Stalmaster to pick me up. My nail polish was chipped, I needed a shower from sweating bullets in the prior interview with Playboy. That particular audition was for Playmate of the Month early the next year, and I had negotiated until I was finally offered $3000 without even having to drop my drawers. It was the 70s all right, and the truth was that I made about that much working for a whole year at Cinema 7 in Eugene. So that was quite a coup, if I do say so myself. But all I could do now, locked out from my luggage, was to apply a spot of lipstick and perfume I found in my purse, and sit in the hallway and wait for Mr. Stalmaster to come and take me to dinner, hopefully still wanting to audition me after seeing what a wreak I was. The truth was I was terrified, about where Lucretia was, and how could I get ahold of her to tell her we were locked out? And where would I be able to stay without any luggage? It might have been the hippie-dippie loosey-goosey 70s in Oregon, but in Hollywood decorum was everything. Any small hint that you might be a hooker, (like having no luggage) would slam shut many doors that were otherwise open. I had to learn this again a few years later when I had a celebratory drink at the Polo Lounge with Michael Murphy, an Oregon Producer, after we had successfully pitched his project to Jack Nicholson.

For dinner at Jack’s house I had shed my Polyester business suit for a low-cut black sweater with jeans and black boots. That outfit was not allowed in the Polo Lounge. Finally, not knowing what else to do, I just sat and waited in the lobby of the bar until I could talk some doctor into going in there for me, which happened, and then he found and brought me my little black book. Needless to say, I was late for dinner at Jack’s house! But here I was again, locked out of where I needed to go, and inappropriately dressed for my evening audition in a daytime business suit. As Lynn walked down the hallway to where I sat on the floor, I could tell he was more than a little surprised and wondering about me and the whole situation. I promptly burst out in tears and told him the truth, I had locked myself out, was so sorry I was such a mess, and we immediately became friends. He took me to dinner, and then to his house where he let me take a shower, pull myself together and offered to let me stay in his daughter’s room. And then he gently led me into my motion picture audition, (my Hollywood first!) by telling me the story of Vrooder’s Hootch and about the character I was auditioning for. When I was ready he read with me, playing the character of Timothy Bottoms. Just like riding a bicycle, my old training from South Eugene Drama Teacher Ed Ragazzino came back, and remembering what he had said about acting for film, I delivered my lines in a very understated way. When we were through my audition, Lynn he told me I was “a natural actress;” the very words Ed had used. And I had been elevated to the next step, which was a meeting with the Producer of the film at the Studio. Now that was all settled, I could relax over a glass of wine, and I told him the whole story of my day, including the offer from Marilyn Grabowski and Playboy Magazine. He advised me very gently to turn it down, because he said I had real chance at a real career as an actress in LA; and the Playboy gig would be “the kiss of death’ for my career. And I believed him. These guys had gone all out to help me. So I turned it down.

These guys had gone all out to help me. So I turned it down. He also wanted me to change my last name back to my maiden name, too; but I could not do that for many reasons. But I stayed with him for three days until I found Stuart Diamond had returned from New York and luckily Lucretia, too, who was back at the apartment. In the meantime I went to Lynn’s office with him every day and watched him work. We would then have dinner and talk over the day’s auditions, and maybe even go disco dancing at the Candy Store. He had also set up my “lunch” with Producer Michael Gruskoff at Fox, as I was his recommendation for the part in Vrooder’s Hootch. He and Mark Rydell had also set me up with the Dean at USC Film School, and I was amazed when the Dean promised me admission and even a scholarship, just based on their word. And then it all fell apart. Not because of Grabowski, or Rydell, or Stalmaster. It fell apart because of me. When I went to the meeting at Fox for lunch with an Executive there, the Executive made it clear that I was lunch, if I wanted the role in the film. And I told him no. I’m happy to play sexy roles, I loved to do that for film, with lots of make-up and hair stylists and even be a scantily-clad-clothes horse, but sex was sacred. I was the one who decided if I felt something deeper than what was in my reptilian brain. That was worthy of sacred sex. And I packed my bags and came home to Oregon, vowing to create my own kind of industry. Lynn Stalmaster. He had not only taught me how to audition when he guided me in my interpretation of the character, but showed me how it was done repeatedly in his office, and had inadvertently given me a crash course in how to be a Casting Director. That became my bread and butter for the next 20 some years on 30-some films (a few even Oscar nominations and Blockbusters) and National commercials. And we stayed in touch.

I’ll never forget the day my friend and colleague Lana Veenker, as my casting director, took me to Vancouver BC to meet one of the Twilight Wolfpack boys for the lead role in my screenplay Blanket of the Sun. As Stalmaster had done with me, and as I had done with over 100 starring and featured roles that I had cast in films over the intervening years, I led him through the story line into the character. His audition became electrifying. And Lana and I looked at each other with such incredulity, that we got to create and experience such great timeless moments. Thank you, Lynn; for this incredible gift. Because I don’t think I would ever have been able to continue to be a filmmaker as just an actress. But it wasn’t until I attended the U of O again, at 69 years of age; that I realized why; and that was when Professor Pyle was teaching me, about me, in his class; when we were studying Literary theorist Laura Mulvaney and her Essay “Visual Pleasure and Narrative Cinema,” (1973) he stated: “her analysis of the “looked-at-ness” of the figure of the woman – her status as “object to be seen” – tells us why this reduces women, and it is essentially because (as stated on page 15 of her Essay) she is “tied to her place of bearer, not maker, of meaning.”246 This one sentence alone, for me, is full of the agency of language, as it evokes bondage with the word “tied,” evokes powerlessness and patronizing condescension with “her place,” as in “putting her in her place;” and evokes also the painful labor of childbearing and a terrible weight with the word “bearer.” The sentence also implies that the “bearing”; is not voluntary, it is a burden forced to be taken, as if women were originally created for and defined as “beasts of burden.” In other words, God created women as he created Eve, such as found in the Olde English Genesis: (… and as a punishment for partaking of the tree of good and evil) God says to Eve: “You shall be under male rule, tightly restricted in awe of man, and abject shall you suffer the error of your ways, await death, and in weeping and lamentation give birth to sons and daughters in the world through great sorrow.”247 But it is in the words “…of bearer, not maker, of meaning,” that we find", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634243568_cleaned.txt:125:ff19ef7de299", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 1553, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634243568_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634243568", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634243568_cleaned", "chunk_index": 126, "text": "found in the Olde English Genesis: (… and as a punishment for partaking of the tree of good and evil) God says to Eve: “You shall be under male rule, tightly restricted in awe of man, and abject shall you suffer the error of your ways, await death, and in weeping and lamentation give birth to sons and daughters in the world through great sorrow.”247 But it is in the words “…of bearer, not maker, of meaning,” that we find not only is woman a bearer, and she is indeed “under male rule” like a mule; but the sentence implies that men, like Adam, is God-like in that he can create meaning; but she cannot. What does this mean? The word, meaning? It is a noun. It is an adjective. For me, it means choosing the agency of language in order to be heard. 248 In Part III, on page 19, of her Essay; Mulvaney cuts to the chase. Cinema has become the poster child for this interplay between sender and receiver: “Women displayed as sexual object is the leitmotif of erotic spectacle she holds the look, (with her to-be-looked-at-ness) and plays to and signifies male desire.”249 So the male is the sender and the female the receiver of the Male Gaze, which is how meaning is created. And women bear the-to-be-looked at-ness. In other words, woman cannot even convey information or concepts. They are only the receiver, and even though they can bear children, they cannot create them; they are only the receptive vessel of the male/God’s life-giving power to create human beings through Apollonian Arrows shot into the receptive Dionysian by the phallus. The terms Apollonian and Dionysian are from Friedrich Nietzsche in The Birth of Tragedy. However, I certainly agree with whomever “Faculty” is at Florida International University: Using these terms we can see that Platonism and Neo-Platonism clearly advocated Apollonian values and denigrated the Dionysian. It is also worth mentioning that the Dionysian values are often associate(d) with females and the feminine. Keep in mind that “female hysteria” was a common medical diagnosis, made exclusively in women, which dates back to ancient Greece. Women have long been portrayed as more sensitive, emotional and more “physical” (limited and/or determined by their bodies) then men.250 So how can women ever turn back the clock to Plato where this all started? Essentially, as Laura said, “We can’t.” But she infers we can transcend it, “the first blow … is to free the look of the camera in its materiality into time and space.” And that is invoking the need for women behind the lenses, creating their own omniscient view of story, and not just behind the lenses, but as Directors who chose the story, clothing and dialog; and therefore will be as close as we will probably ever get to the time when God was a Woman.251 And she", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634243568_cleaned.txt:126:f9fe746e8af8", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 1554, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634243568_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634243568", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634243568_cleaned", "chunk_index": 127, "text": "infers we can transcend it, “the first blow … is to free the look of the camera in its materiality into time and space.” And that is invoking the need for women behind the lenses, creating their own omniscient view of story, and not just behind the lenses, but as Directors who chose the story, clothing and dialog; and therefore will be as close as we will probably ever get to the time when God was a Woman.251 And she was right, because I returned to Oregon with a vengeance. I wanted to create a Film Industry in Oregon that honored integrity. And it took me almost 20 years, but I did it. And I wanted to produce films from stories about women, like John Barth’s Chimera, (1972) that reimagined the ancient 1001 Nights through the eyes of Scheherazade and her little sister Dunyziad. I almost convinced Michael Douglas to film it, when he was looking for romantic and erotic films for women a few years later! And I did make a toast at dinner at Jack Nicholson’s house taken from this book, too. More on that in the next Chapters. But I ended up having to work with what I had at the time, which was a local film crew, my girlfriend Lucretia and her beau Don Gilbert, and his financer. And we worked really hard to make romantic and sexy films from a woman’s point of view, for the next 6 months; when once again I got a call from a director, one that Dan Webb had also instigated for me, and it was for a much larger budget film to be shot in Portland. So essentially, Mulvaney helped define exactly what gave me the creeps regarding “weaponized women,” “the male gaze” and “the patriarchal” the cameras and the action; we had all this power and did not know what to do with it. The closest we would come was to put women in control of their bodies in our movies, and/or maybe reverse the role-playing. There was no manual for how to be a young woman in the 1970s, either; so instinctively we looked to the tribes, who had inspired us with their matriarchal societies in the early 60s. According to Doug George-Kanentiio: “In our society, women are the center of all things. Nature, we believe, has given women the ability to create; therefore it is only natural that women be in positions of power to protect this function. We traced our clans through women; a child born into the world assumed the clan membership of its mother. In all countries, real wealth stems from the control of land and its resources.

Our Iroquois philosophers knew this as well as we knew natural law. To us it made sense for women to control the land since they were far more sensitive to the rhythms of the Mother Earth. We did not own the land but were custodians of it. Our women decided any and all issues involving territory, including where a community was to be built and how land was to be used. The men are chiefs and the women clan-mothers. As leaders, the women closely monitor the actions of the men and retain the right to veto any law they deem inappropriate. Our women not only hold the reigns of political and economic power, they also have the right to determine all issues involving the taking of human life. Declarations of war had to be approved by the women, while treaties of peace were subject to their deliberations.”252 This was also true of my beloved Nez Perce, whose ancient Clan mother said not to kill Lewis and Clark. Imagine what this world would be like without unnecessary violence and war? And imagine also our land protected from corporate greed and war against Mother Nature? It was time that Plato’s feminine Khôra was redeemed as an equal, and not inferior to the male. Plato needed to come out of his own cave in this regard. And the New Age was about to do just that for him: And just as Marranos (biculturals) are oblivious and unsure of their past and identity, impure and contaminated, universally despised, yet precisely because of that masters of survival, so is khôra: treated by Plato as being metaphysically inferior…. It signifies another desert: not the one of a raging jealousy of the One God who cannot stand any rivalry, but the one of an original contamination, heterogeneity, always already ‘more-than-one,’ subtle and generous potentiality that is not yet formed into rigid identities, of a ‘still life’, but nonetheless always surviving, living-on, always there, in the dark silent background, hidden and secret.253 Was Plato keeping Khôra outside of the Gates of Athens for this reason? Because of her perceived inferior Dionysus-like Femininity to the superior Masculine Apollyonic-like Logic? If so, that’s how he got away with disembodied rhetoric, logic and reasoning. And Plato is much to blame for what happened to our world. Because a world without heart, even if the heart makes us crazy, is a world that is dangerous without the Feminine properties of intuition and regeneration.

However, whenever things get this far out lock Holmes. There was another one I wrote about a “Miss Kitty” who kept the law and order. I remember doing a strip tease dance on the table at White Horse Tavern, actually two of them, one with a contemporary crowd about Lumberjacks who in the story messed with some girls, and then were snitched on. After the good guys talked to the same matriarchal woman who played “Shirley” in the other film, but was now “Kitty” in a similar role; the bad guys got beat up for it in the tavern. The other was a very slow strip tease for my Existential Western, In these three particular films, women were the judge and jury; and as the Iroquois spokesman said, consulted “the women (who) closely monitor the actions of the men” as they once did, in the tribes. Even in a modern-day film, like Dances With Wolves, the Chief, Kicking Bird, asks his wife what it is that the “people” say about the relationship regarding Kevin Costner and The Chief ’s adapted white daughter. I was taught to always talk to the wives of the Chiefs. If I wanted to talk to the Holy Man Horace Axtell, I would call Andrea. If I wanted to talk to Soy Redthunder, I would call Sharon, and if I wanted to call Sabe Redthunder, I would talk to Atwice Kamiakun. Remember when I said Indian people have a great sense of humor about sex? Well, Atwice jokingly calls me Wife #2 . Friedrich Engels, in 1884, claimed that, in the earliest stages of human social development, there was group marriage and that therefore paternity was disputable, whereas maternity was not, so that a family could be traced only through the female line, and claimed that this was connected with the dominance of women over men or a Mutterrecht, which notion Engels took from Bachofen, who claimed, based on his interpretations of myths, that myths reflected a memory of a time when women dominated over men.254 “…indigenous peoples’ long histories of basing citizenship on kinship: acting as a community member, facing hardships together and adopting family members informally. Kin-based citizenship has a far longer history than citizenship based on nebulous ideas of “blood quantum,” wherein ancestry is determined by phenotype and ancestral math.”255 It was like America’s gene pool had reached a critical mass of biculturality in the 60s and 70s.

This article supports this: “Native American Ancestors Found in the Genes of Many in the U.S.”256 In the article, a researcher named Conley said the following: “When you go out West, that’s where you have the most Native American ancestry in European populations.” And once again, The Bicultural or Marrano is the closest name for what I would call this, as discussed here: The Marrano context of the modern ‘reflecting faith’ as being secretly internalized and supported only by the ‘inner heart’, itself also prone to forgetting, was spotted very aptly by Yirmiyahu Yovel: “For them [Marranos] authentic religion had been deinstitutionalized and privatized, …depending on the inner heart as its almost sole support.257 But the language of the heart has to be nurtured, and as John Trudell stated, remembered… “There were, of course, supporting fragments of memory and custom, and the sense of secret fraternity.… In the end, and all along, the person had to face the most important religious truths – decisions about value, and about personal fate in this and the next world – within a private ‘inner forum…” Just as Marranos exited all forms of institutionalized religions, being now neither Jewish nor Christian, so does khôra remain outside: “It will never have entered religion and will never permit itself to be sacralized, sanctified, humanized, theologized, cultivated, historicized. Radically heterogenous to the safe and sound, to the holy and the sacred, it never admits of any indemnification.258 In 1972, a sex-positive activist and former prostitute named Margo St. James founded a very unique activist organization called “COY-OTE.” The name is an acronym that stands for “Call Off Your Old Tired Ethics.” COYOTE was an organization that fought for the rights and protection of sex workers, including porn stars, prostitutes, and pimps alike. The goal of the organization was to challenge how much power the state had to interfere in the sex lives of its citizens. COYOTE went on to start a series of newsletters called Coyote Howls (formerly entitled Coyote Growls), in which they kept their readers up to date on the lawsuits and protests that worked to gain rights for all kinds of sex workers. The majority of the writers for Coyote Howls belonged to a new branch of feminism called Sex-positive feminism. These feminists were men and women who fought for total sexual liberation and sex lives that were free from government intervention.259 Many of their lawsuits sought to eliminate police brutality against prostitutes and to decriminalize prostitution.

Other goals of the sex-positive branch of feminism included better sex education, “free love,” and the general acceptance of all sexualities. Carol Queen, a sex-positive feminist and self-proclaimed sexologist offered this definition of sex-positivity: Sex-positive, a term that’s coming into cultural awareness, isn’t a dippy love-child celebration of orgone – it’s a simple yet radical affirmation that we each grow our own passions on a different medium, that instead of having two or three or even half a dozen sexual orientations, we should be thinking in terms of millions. “Sex-positive” respects each of our unique sexual profiles, even as we acknowledge that some of us have been damaged by a culture that tries to eradicate sexual difference and possibility. It’s the cultural philosophy that understands sexuality as a potentially positive force in one’s life, and it can, of course, be contrasted with sex-negativity, which sees sex as problematic, disruptive, dangerous. Sex-positivity allows for and in fact celebrates sexual diversity, differing desires and relationships structures, and individual choices based on consent. 260 Of course Stan Brakhage was getting away with making all sorts of films with nudity and depicting all sorts of sexuality. But that was Art. What we were making was closer to Melodrama. But it still was experimental. And it still was an answer to a call to create. But you had to be called. Kesey was a trailblazer for us when he responded to the call to write Raymond Williams’ said it beautifully “… this condition of pre-emergence, …we need to explore the concept of structure of feeling (127.)” And even de Man’s “Word” and Benjamin’s “aura” all indicate there is a je ne c’est quoi at work in art; that is ephemeral. My favorite quote of Williams was this: “One way of putting this is to note that these experiences often may help me to identify what it is I already know but have yet to figure to myself as knowledge.”261 I love this quote because I believe all of these literary criticism articles are important for just that reason, they give us a language. Remembering that without language we have no culture, we even have no memories; I am reminded of what it was like to come back to film school after being a filmmaker for years.

Walter Murch, Coppola’s editor said it best, and I paraphrase, “we just intuit where to cut to create a way to deliver what the film is saying.” In other words, artists are intuitive, they interpret what the “Universe,” for lack of a better word, is saying. They are expressing the agency of Aura, of The Word, of the Feeling; but don’t have a language to express it in, well, language; except the language of the aura, the word or the feeling in film, paint, poetry, sculpture, etc. So I believe what came first was emanation and then we struggled to describe it. Films gave me a language to describe what we were all feeling, just like English gave me the words to describe things like alliteration; and it is that emanation of aura through feeling that gives us language. For example, Faye Kesey, Ken’s wife said in one of my favorite quotes about Ken: “He was trying to make the whole page move, so it would convey something beyond what the words themselves could say.”262 And Kesey said it, too: “…and if I ever get the call to write something else, I will. But the call must come first. I will not write just for the money.”263 And speaking of “the call,” the first question I asked my current interviewees is, what called you to the counterculture? Invariably it is the same thing. In an interview with Perry Hyde, a Blues and Rock Promoter from Portland, I asked him what brought him to this line of work. He said that it was clear to him as a child that something was really wrong. To come home from school and to watch your president assassinated on television, then watch someone murder the alleged murderer. “It hit me so hard and so fast… we (our generation) knew that all of it was a lie, and we know that we are still paying to cover it up. Just like the Vietnam war. It started as an accident, but they covered that up, too. And kept killing people. It made me so fucking angry.” Perry luckily became involved with BJ Kelly’s, a wonderful bar and restaurant with music venue as an investor, and booked It’s a Beautiful Day in the 70s; and then B.B. King into the new Hult Center for the Performing Arts in the early 80s.

He went all the way through to getting his Master’s in Media Studies and Communication in 1976; and eventually returned to get his Doctorate Degree in 1988. He saw UO Professor Bill Cadbury giving a lecture on a close reading of The Beatles album Sgt. Pepper’s Lonely Heart’s Club Band. “Bill’s lecture was at the EMU, as I remember, and his focus was on analyz- Bill was teaching two film classes, a Monday & Wednesday Class, and a Tuesday & Thursday Class; and screened films for each day’s classes. Alice and Tom led the discussions each week, and then continued to show Foreign films on the weekends. It felt like the whole community was showing up, and my friend Lynn Peterson collected small fees from us non-students. In the meantime, our mutual friend Steve Bove, who was showing films everywhere he could, from 150 Science to the WOW Hall; had successfully navigated the Small Business Administration’s paperwork thanks to my husband at the time, Jay Wilson’s accounting skills; and according to Dr. Peter Alilunas,266 (who has a whole binder of research on Cinema 7); we opened our doors on March 18th, 1974. He also had a blueprint of the place, but didn’t have any images, so Lynnie and I made him a diorama of it. And gave him the Cinema 7 t-shirt Lynnie made. Back then, it was the 70s and I don’t remember anything, it seems, except how all of this felt. It felt pre-ordained and I was just along for the ride. Cinema 7 was the 7th Cinema in Eugene- Springfield at the time. I was so grateful to be a part of it. We showed “Art Films” from any country and any era; as long as it was ART. The Venue was in the Atrium Building, a new building because the City was a long way into bulldozing Eugene’s Old Victorian Downtown with all the Neon and the wooden balloon-framed buildings. They said they were a fire hazard. But I found out from the Fire Marshall in 2003; that 100-year-old clear fir would petrify in that time, and was not flammable! The truth was, the City Fathers and Mayors were threatened by all the “Hippies” starting businesses in the old Victorians downtown.

Cinema 7 was in one of the least obnoxious; The Atrium had growing trees in the lobby with skylights. And we recycled the seats for our venue from the old Heilig Theater. And she created all of the World-Famous Posters. Jack Nicholson was on the mailing list, and told us it was one of the finest “Art Houses” in the world. During the filming of Cuckoo’s Nest, even Academy Award winner Louise Fletcher came down to see a film she was recently in, called Thieves Like Us. She was so taken with Cinema 7 “she wanted to party with us afterward.”267 Echoes from the Set Vol. II (1967- 1977) – Shadows from the Underground: Cinema Under the Influence through Saturday; which were the prime nights where we would order out from Poppi’s Anatolia and would always have a large bottle of the Queen on hand, (Bombay Gin) for visiting “Dignitaries and Filmophiles” coming to kvetch in the back room. The back room was notorious for discussing film, politics, culture, drugs, sex, rock and roll, and even Debussy. The theater had a nautical-hatch window that could open in the door, so that Steve could monitor the lobby. We could also monitor the theater through the projector windows. Everybody in the back was quiet during the reel changeovers while we held our collective breath, because we were perfectionists. Our motto was “Better images, perfect sound.” But the worst part was another Art House opened, closer to campus. And we ended up doing what the grand old movie theaters did, we started midnight shows, and when that didn’t work, we had to throw caution to the wind and become the first theater to show X-rated films. It is not that X-rated film was some kind of pariah. We showed films that were X- rated and had won Academy Awards, like Midnight Cowboy. However, even Klute and Don’t Look Now had some serious sexual mojo going on… but it was the legalities. The defining fine line was “gratuitous sex, with no redeemable social value.” And from what I understand, even making these “alternative films” was illegal in Los Angeles County, since 1972, which is why they were making them here in Oregon.

We were pushing the envelope, we knew, even making them here. But it was up to a regional theater board to determine the final answer about local theaters, and the district attorney to enforce that and manufacturing adult cinema. So we wrote a letter to the local DA, Pat Horton, and asked him if he would arrest us if we showed Deep Throat. We didn’t hear from him, so we went ahead and ordered it. But on the night that we had advertised we were first going to show it, we all went to dinner before show time at Leslie’s Mandarin Restaurant, and were prepared to go to jail. We had a normal Cinema 7 billing that Friday night, but as soon as that showing got out, we opened the doors for either the police or the midnight show. Suddenly we saw what seemed like half of Eugene out there, but no cops. There was a line that went down the hall, around the corner, down the stairs and outside the building. I’ll never forget the shocking sight of my gynecologist with two girls on his arms buying tickets from me. But we had to turn most of them away. That night, and the next night, and for the Friday and Saturday night Midnight shows over the following weeks, it was insane. The Cinema was saved. And as the crowds petered out for Deep Throat, it started all over again for Behind the Green door. In an interview with Cinema 7’s Steve Bove’, Lloyd Paseman (The Eugene Register Guard Film Critic) interviews him for the Register Guard Newspaper in 1981. Steve states he kept Marilyn Chambers (the star of Behind the Green Door) around “to help with rising expenses.”249 I never watched them. Except I was exposed to one scene in Deep Throat while trying to find someone in the audience who had an emergency at home. And I thought the scene was kind of funny. “Do you mind if I smoke while you eat?” Even as a serious filmmaker, right? But I still had problems with it because of the incest, sexual harassment, and the violent near rape I experienced, creating the creeps because of the male “bearer of meaning.” And I hated Green Door’s opening soundtrack song called “Bubbles,” which we could hear in the lobby when people opened the door to get in, because waiting in line had made them late.

Mostly because there was absolutely no romance or love tied to the sex act. That was against my religion. The religion of Peace, Love and Understanding. Nor any reciprocal pleasure. I lived in the Haight (Frederick St.) in 65-66 at the height and during the “Summer of Love.” Unlike many there, I had a job and laid off drugs for the most part. What I saw was all the “hippie tourists” flocking there not to gain spiritual discovery or an alternative lifestyle, but to get high, laid, and be able to brag back home. By And that is when I decided to quit the “Alternative Cinema” industry, because it wasn’t about seduction anymore, it was about kidnapping women and other very patriarchal fantasy kinds of stuff. I wasn’t necessarily against it, I believed people should be free to watch what they wanted. But then the perfect “out” for me appeared, a call from Dan Webb, about going to Portland to make a film with some people up there, one of them an Emmy Award winner for “Sign News” in LA. His name was Peter Wechsberg. His mother was a Ballerina in the Royal Ballet Company, whose plane was bombed leaving Berlin after a Recital. The explosion was so loud that Peter was born deaf as a result, but it never stopped him. After winning his Emmy, he recruited old friends from Gallaudet University to help him make a film.269 They hired me, because like Peter, I was an underground filmmaker, who had learned nearly every craft required to make a film. I did some acting, set design, location scouting as well as Make-up and Hair, which took me nearly 3 hours to transform Peter’s normally blonde/blue-eyes into dark Count Dracula and his son Deafula. 270 It was the first film ever made for the deaf. We shot it in Portland with J. Wilder Mincey, a fairly good cinematographer. And with some of Will Vinton’s film crew. They later helped me get work as a Set Designer in Portland; so much so, that I was a commuter catching the Amtrak Train to Portland only blocks from my house. My favorite part about Deafula was learning sign language. Nearly the whole cast was Deaf, and so was my character, Deafula’s Mom, who was married to a Minister, but has an affair with Count Dracula, and becomes pregnant with Deafula as a result.

Once again, a woman was the Villain in the Drama. Like Eve, she fell for a Snake. This one offered a huge diamond ring, however. What is a girl going to do? She becomes grateful to have at least some interesting costumes to wear. And man, did we have incredible locations as well. They put me in charge of set decoration for one of them. The others were, like most of the independent 70s films, shot in people’s houses that were already decorated by the owners. One of these locations was the Pittock Mansion out West Burnside Blvd. in Portland, and it was already decorated incredibly well as a “period” Victorian. The other was a cabin, I think on the way to Mt. Hood. But there was one location that I wanted to personally interpret with set design. It is where Count Dracula’s Coffin is, and where Deafula, now as an adult, goes to kill him. There he finds me, now an ancient Hag; his mother, the woman that allegedly had died giving birth to him; but she is among the undead, now, in the cave. The cave was near Grants Pass, Oregon; and was part of the Oregon Cave National Monument. As we set up the HMI lights, the bats were crazed by the activity and the hot lamps of the lights. I knew that normally they wouldn’t bite if they didn’t get entangled in your hair. I was so glad I had a hooded cape to wear. The Premiere was amazing, too, in late January 1975. But I was praying, to what I’ve come to believe is something deep inside me, to help me create a living wage film industry for myself and my friends and especially for my beloved Oregon; and I was answered with a very synchronous event. A call from the Oregon film commissioner Warren Merrill: “Would you please bring someone to the set of One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest for me?” I Ching Hexagram #2 The Receptive: Only because nature in its myriad forms corresponds with the myriad impulses of the Creative can it make these impulses real.

He was just there, like antimatter. I didn’t have to create him; the patients built him for me. But the Indian was different. I don’t own the soul of that Indian. He just appeared while I was on peyote, and the first chapter of that book was written by him. So, that makes me wonder am I as talented as I might think or as others think? Or am I an instrument picked to make a statement, and after the statement is made, should I assume I’ve got the right to make endless statements?… See, I know now that the Indian in Cuckoo was not my Indian. He was brought into being by some higher power to tell America where it’s at. Kesey’s quote seems to allude to a critical literary theory that I re-cently wrote about for Professor Pyle’s class at the U of O: “we can see how the ‘agency of language’ is something other than an ‘instrument of an author’s intentions or expressions’ when it is not a relationship between it and it, and not temporal, but eternal, like when the poet creates Odes to a Grecian Urn or The West Wind; and personifies in them “Thou”-like qualities, when the I-it ‘contains the potential of becoming I-Thou,’ and according to Buber, it is ‘the situation in which man’s true personality emerges within the context of his world.’”274 And not only that, but truly is ^(α)(…) the only I-Thou situation that man can sustain indefinitely.” This is the goal, according to Roland Barthes: “We know that in order to restore writing to its future, we must reverse the Myth; the birth of the reader must be requited, by the death of the author.”275 Furthermore,", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634243568_cleaned.txt:138:f76a01af6913", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 1566, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634243568_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634243568", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634243568_cleaned", "chunk_index": 139, "text": "potential of becoming I-Thou,’ and according to Buber, it is ‘the situation in which man’s true personality emerges within the context of his world.’”274 And not only that, but truly is ^(α)(…) the only I-Thou situation that man can sustain indefinitely.” This is the goal, according to Roland Barthes: “We know that in order to restore writing to its future, we must reverse the Myth; the birth of the reader must be requited, by the death of the author.”275 Furthermore, in the Chapter called “Return to Philology” from Theory and History of Literature, Volume 33 by Paul de Man, I found a quote that, as I told my professor, Kesey would also say was very psychedelic: “Close reading … cannot fail to respond to structures of language(,) which it is the more or less secret aim of literary teaching to keep hidden.”276 I know how to create structure for screenplays like 1st act, 2nd act, and 3rd act turning points. I know how to structure scenes within the three acts, so a reader doesn’t burst out laughing at the worst possible place because the high tension was kept up too long without a “down” scene. Therefore, I am trusting that the structures of language are like the structures of a screenplay, and in essence are like a blueprint that shows how the sentence would work in a 3-dimensional way through images. The first six words in de Man ‘s quoted sentence tells us that “close reading cannot fail to respond.”278 This indicates that the properties of close reading have magical properties of responding to our efforts, much like what Benveniste tells us in Problems of General Linguistics: “…the creative power of language, which establishes an imaginary reality, animates inert things, reveals what does not yet exist, and recalls to the present what has disappeared.”279 In the former sentence, “close reading” does all three: by “establishing an imaginary reality” of words responding to us, because they “animate(s) an inert thing” such as letters on a page; and “reveals what does not exist” which is the hidden layer of meaning. And speaking of a hidden layer of meaning, “which it is the more or less secret aim of literary teaching to keep hidden;” for me, this brings to mind an allegory of the Professor as High Priest; as in that one has to go through them, an intermediary, like some have to do with the Priests in the churches, to talk to God. The use of the “more or less” is similar in scope to different branches of organized religion, some are “more” adamant about keeping to the hierarchical structure, demanding sometimes that one prays to the Mother Mary to then intercede in talking to Jesus, who then talks to God for us; while others are “less” in that they allow one to talk straight to God. Like Spinoza, the Pastoral Pagan", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634243568_cleaned.txt:139:ec85340ddb21", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 1567, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634243568_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634243568", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634243568_cleaned", "chunk_index": 140, "text": "do with the Priests in the churches, to talk to God.

Like Spinoza, the Pastoral Pagan believes that they, the rocks, the trees and the earth and all other living things are God; and find it silly to go through intermediaries, in giving that very important task to the human symbolic representatives of God, especially since they are human just like we are, and therefore fallible. The “secret aim” of course, is easy to understand, if one follows the money. Churches, Popes and Priests are venerated with huge cash flows for their intersessions. And that brings me to another incredible understanding of the statement by de Man, and that has confirmed my deepest hopes about being a writer, and that definition is regarding someone or something, who can make a living from channeling the symbols and meter, the un-words pressing for expression during high moments of inspiration or sorrow, to reveal the words of the Universe that pre-existed before humans, time and space, and in a quantum mechanics sort of way, created downward causation of the word into matter. But the most important words of all, relating to Kesey’s quote about a “Higher Power” writing the book, are these: “recalls to the present what has disappeared.”280 Which is right out of Leslie Fiedler’s Return of the Vanishing American.281 Because in essence, what Kesey did, when he created The New Western, was he animated the “Cigar Store Indian” and made the Noble Savage human, by giving him a voice, albeit a bicultural voice, a voice that created stories out of constellations, symbols out of stars, pictographs out of life. Most people don’t remember that Will Sampson’s character in Kesey’s book was a mixed race, white and Native, like so many people. And that we bicultural, mixed races suffer from navigating between the two or more cultures in our own minds, hearts and bodies. When I met Will on the set, during the basketball scene, he gravitated toward me alone on a bench. We didn’t need to talk, all he said was ‘nice bracelet.” We were skin – we were kin. We resonated on the same frequency and didn’t need words.

Lawrence’s Studies in Classic American Literature as “the most interesting book ever written about American culture (n. pag).… Indeed, Lawrence identifies in the American classics a proto-Futurist aesthetic of the extreme: “The furthest frenzies of French modernism or futurism have not yet reached the pitch of extreme consciousness that Poe, Melville, Hawthorne, Whitman reached. The European moderns are all trying to be extreme. The great Americans I mention just were it.”282 I know that Ken was a huge fan of Moby Dick, and we both loved Whitman’s Leaves of Grass. If I was able to, I would try to trace the influences of what Lawrence called “ancient cosmic theories” in their work. However, Kesey’s love of Keats and Yeats, I can ascribe to his Irish heritage, too; but more importantly to his biculturality found within The Return of the Vanishing American by Fiedler. Because as Lawrence says, a biculturality of Irish and Native American are all about “science and religion” being in “accord.” “But what Lawrence called his new science should be understood as an attempt to approximate those ‘ancient cosmic theories’ in which ‘science and religion were in accord,’ and thereby to reconcile belief systems or kinds of knowledge which modernity judges to be antithetical.283 In this regard, the first version of Studies is akin to W.B. Yeats’s A Vision ( 1925; 1937), which also purports to be a new science, albeit one in which, as Kathleen Raine explains, “not matter but mind-consciousness-is the ground of reality as we experience it.”284 However, I digress. Kesey was a World Class author, yes. He was a Pioneer of archaic drug-induced consciousness, as out-pictured with the decolonized Indian in One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest. But Ken always wanted to be a filmmaker, first, last and always. And because of his living his dream, I got to be one, too. And I was also the one who got to be there, on the set, almost against my will; because I was aware that he wasn’t happy with the production, and like my fellow Taurus’ Mountain Girl and Jack Nicholson, I was extremely loyal. Especially to Ken. But the Universe conspired against me, when someone I owed a favor to begged me to step in and go to the set. It was the Oregon film commissioner, and it turns out it was to replace him, to actually replace the Oregon Film Commissioner. In the end, I was also Ken’s eyes and ears there, especially when it came to Producer Michael Douglas.

Because by the end of the filming, and for the next two years, including Ken’s lawsuit against him, I was very close to Michael. And that was how I was appointed by Governor Bob Straub to the set of the film adaptation of One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest in 1975. I had made friends there while lobbying his office and the legislature for the Indigenous Film Crew of Oregon, because we crewmembers, who were working for Bob Gilbert in Eugene, and for Will Vinton in Portland; were really getting good, and we didn’t want to see the movie jobs go to people from out of state, if possible. This appointment was before I knew anything about the film really, except what Kesey had said about it. And I knew he was quoting the I Ching when interviewed about it back then. He said that Book Publishers and now the Film Producers were like “Pump Salesmen” and he was “The Well.” The Well is Hexagram #48.1 I knew he wasn’t happy with them, because they didn’t use his screenplay, told through The Indian’s Grandmother, I think; nor their casting choices, as he wanted Kirk Douglas to play McMurphy; and had left the pre-production after about 2 weeks in, about the end of January. But Kesey was Bicultural, and so was I. I understood exactly how he felt. The way of collaboration, of “Barn Raising”; of everyone working together to create something is often usurped by linear capitalistic bottom lines. And the integrity of the project is compromised by profit. We just don’t get that. But even more integral in this situation is the dilemma of the bicultural, and that is the “third language” we have to create to bridge the two cultures in our own minds. And that I think, is why he was so metaphorical. Sometimes I think the “agency of language” intercedes and we don’t even know what it is we are saying.

And especially this image, where through the window, she makes it clear that her patients are never really heard: It is not a coincidence, that by shattering a window the Indian escapes. And it is not a coincidence that windows represented vision but not really sound, especially around this “Machine” of a woman; reminiscent of the automaton women, like Maria in Fritz Lang’s Metropolis and Olimpia in Hoffman’s The Sandman.285 I was there for all of these scenes. Not only that, this movie is so important to me that I wrote 5 Chapters about it in Volume I of Echoes from the Set (1967-2017). For that book I also wrote that Ken Kesey’s champion as an undergrad was literary critic Leslie Fiedler, who fought hard for him to get the Woodrow Wilson Fellowship to Stanford. Fiedler’s book is fully titled The Return of the Vanishing American. In it he discusses John Barthes Sot-Weed Factor, where, if I remember right, he learns about the hallucinogenic effects of Sot-weed (as in besotted) the original American Indian high-powered tobacco. Also known as what is put into the “Peace Pipe.” The designated carriers of Pipes in a tribe know they have to be very strong to carry those pipes. I had a friend who had to give one back, because she didn’t feel that she was strong enough to “carry” it, and to deal with its power. I had the same thing happen to me, when a 3000-year-old artifact was given to me by a 108- year-old Mexican Curandera. And Ed Edmo, my Shoshone Bannock friend, also a friend of Kesey’s, said that the North American Church’s Peyote Ceremonies require many things, including that there has “not been anger in the last 5 days of its participants”286 and requires a special ceremony before imbibing in the archaic drug. So when Kesey said that “The Indian wrote the first Chapter of the book,” we know what that really means. It is an intense journey. And we know that archaic drugs access the past and the future.

Because Life is a circle, and a Medicine Wheel. The Prophet says the Creator moistens with his own tears, our medicine. What was the medicine that Kesey brought through his book? Through the Indian? And through the window? In Kesey’s book, The Indian is bicultural. (So was Will Sampson.) He is a mixed blood, whom we assumed was deaf, and/or dumb. “…it wasn’t me that started acting deaf; it was people that first started acting like I was too dumb to hear or see or say anything at all.”287 Bromden metaphorically represents the wooden and silent Cigar Store Indian. For me, he also represents the speaker of this metaphorical 3rd language created by Biculturalism. The broom he holds in both his hands anchors him to the ground, while his mind thinks about the Combine. The Combine is a machine whose name “derives from its combining three separate harvesting operations – reaping, threshing, and winnowing – into a single process.”288 The Combine is also a machine that killed Celilo Falls, when it was dammed in 1957 to create hydro-electric power. The turbine engines also had three separate functions: to generate power for electricity, to regulate water levels in case of floods, and to shoot Salmon smelt 600 miles an hour up-river. I can’t imagine why they don’t think that has something to do with the declining fish count of the whole upper Columbia River Tributary system. This event was devastating to all of the Columbia Plateau Tribes, who shared Celilo and celebrated there in ceremony all of the Natives fishing traditions for as long as time was old. It could drive an Indian mad to lose this resource in addition to having his land stolen, his people dead from genocide, not to mention his language, and all of his other traditions. Ed Edmo witnessed the flooding of Celilo Falls, March 10, 1957. This is what he says about it: “How can something so beautiful, so big be taken away? It hurt my heart hard. The thunder of the falls is still in my heart!”289 Kesey claimed to have once seen a really tall Indian protesting at Celilo, which is a stone’s throw from the I-84 E. Freeway to Pendleton. Another time he may have heard of one who put a knife in his teeth and ran screaming into a speeding Log Truck. I know he admired them. What we didn’t know was that he could have been one of them.

What we didn’t know was that he could have been one of them. Nor did I know about my heritage at the time. But we spoke the same language. We were comfortable with each other. We understood each other. Bromden was both of us. Bromden is also all biculturals. And Bromden was released from his silence when McMurphy stood up to the Big Nurse, and then the Combine had a monkey wrench thrown into it. McMurphy also treated The Chief just like one of the guys. He wasn’t literally put on a pedestal as a Noble or Wooden Indian. He was part of the basketball game, and even more importantly, was heard by McMurphy. For me, Cuckoo’s Nest released the American Indian from its’ stereotype, and opened the door for equality with the freedom to simply be human beings; when its Bromden character, not McMurphy, smashes the window and escapes into the night. It is Bromden who solves the problem of racism in the community, but not with a gun. But by breaking the window that kept people, framed in Stereotypes that creates a barrier from hearing each other, and stuck in seeing just the differences. McMurphy asks us to do the same, so that we can be free, too. My first day on set was February 11th, 1975. Preproduction was over and filming had begun. The scene was the Electro-shock therapy scene. I was shown a metal chair that was just like all of the ones lining the wall of an ante room, that led into the electro-shock room. Brilliant white and sterile. Jack is wheeled into the other room on a Gurney. Then he is wheeled out, without his shoes on. “Continuity”273 reminds him to put his shoes back on before the next take. As he does so, he decides to sit a chair closer to me than the one he initially was going to sit in. But it is still across the small room. The crew chuckles. He is wheeled back in, for his take, and is wheeled back out, 10 or 15 times. Each time he sits one chair closer to me to put his shoes back on. Finally he is 2 chairs away from me and the crew is howling. If he was trying to unnerve me, it was working. But the next time he was gurney-ed out, Michael Douglas sent his brother Joel to ask me to cocktails after wrap. I was so relieved to have somewhere to go, away from Jack’s up and down arching eyebrows, I said yes.

I was so relieved to have somewhere to go, away from Jack’s up and down arching eyebrows, I said yes. When Jack returned, he sat next to me and asked me if I would like to go to dinner. I said no, but that I had a present for him, and could we go to his trailer, knowing that wrap would take a while. That is when he told me about the Film Commissioner accusing him of smoking pot on the set, and why Warren was 86’ed by the Producers. He had responded, he said, with: “What? Are you nuts?” And I laughed, and said that is what I would have said, because who would want to get high in a place like this 100-year-old looney bin? Then I handed him a Thai Stick. But before I left I had him fill out one of my Casting Files. And tonight, as I was writing this, I just realized he corrected my spelling of “comments.” After 45 years of having this file, I just now noticed. Now, Jack has had the last laugh on me; we had many, including on set, at his parties, and when I stayed at his house over the next 7-8 years, until I got sober and had kids. And even now, we still laugh, but on the phone. February 26th, 1975. The day we filmed the Basketball Scene was the day I got to meet Will Sampson. We were outside and it was a pretty great day, weather wise, for Oregon. I had heard several stories about how they found Will Sampson. No doubt by the Car Salesman who sold cars to the Indians back then. I had already heard stories about similar Reservation car salesmen in Chiloquin. And I also heard they had to helicopter in to where Will was being a “hoe-dad,” a tree planter; somewhere way up in the North woods to notify him of an audition. Another said he was at the car lot and the Car Salesman called Michael and told him he had finally seen him, six months after Michael had asked him to start looking. Whatever brought Will there that day was a modern miracle. It was indicative of the “Magic” that happened when anything to do with Kesey happened. We all could feel it. I think Ken’s powerful experience in writing the character brought him from the other world to the dance. That synchronistic dance we danced back then.

During the filming, I know all eyes were on Jack that day on the basketball court, because it was Press Day. But the person who came to sit next to me was Will. Like I said before, I was wearing a Native Bracelet. He said, “Nice Bracelet.” I said, ‘Thank you.” but that is all we said. Like Kesey and me. We would sit and say nothing, because of the energy engulfing us was so intense, we didn’t want to break the spell. Now I know that it really is a Native thing, a bicultural thing. You feel safe, never misunderstood, and at peace. You know what the rules are, the rules to love each other and never hurt each other. Kesey once said to me, as he took my hand, and held it; during a meeting with a possible film financier: “I know you would never hurt me in a million years,” he said, But what wasn’t said, yet was implied was, “I have to protect myself from these other kinds of people.” In the documentary, The Life and Times of the Red Dog Saloon; Milan Melvin, (aka Sweet Sir Galahad, as Joan Baez sang about him) had a great quote about US: (and I paraphrase) “… there were whores and thieves and outlaws … you know, people you can trust.”290 That is the kind of trust Kesey portrayed in Cuckoo’s Nest. It is the kind that the inmates had for McMurphy; even when he charged each of them more for renting the boat than it cost, as the Big Nurse pointed out. But he had given them more back, they reasoned, so it was an honest swindle. Evidently, not so with Hollywood types. Ken didn’t trust them at all, as a matter of fact, and his good friend Hunter S. Thompson had a great quote about it, that I know Ken liked: “The Film Business is a shallow money trench. A long, plastic hallway where theives and pimps run free and good men die like dogs.

But instead I am using this one, again from Clyde Keller; of the Hoo-Haw, with Steve Christiansen, Bill Murray, Paul Goldshein, Ken Kesey and Bill Bradbury. And I am so glad that I am, because we just lost Steve this year, and I wanted to honor him. My pardner in film, Bob Laird, was a really close friend, and found actual footage of this shot in Steve’s Betamax Video collection. Laird said he heard that a LA Production Company had created the first video camera and brought it up for Kesey to see, and all these guys from the local TV Stations came to try it out. As you can see, Steve (far left) is holding a local KVAL Channel 13 TV camera in the shot; but in the video, it also shows him filming Kesey with one that looks just like the camera Kesey is holding in this photo. The point of all this, is to show how we were back then, everybody sharing techniques and equipment with everybody else. I also found a hilarious blurb about these cameras, and this just about sums it all up about our film gang: The Portapak would seem to have been invented specifically for use by artists. Just when pure formalism had run its course; just when it became politically embarrassing to make objects, but ludicrous to make nothing; just when many artists were doing performance works but had nowhere to perform, or felt the need to keep a record of their performances; just when it began to seem silly to ask the same old Berkleean question, ‘If you build a sculpture in the desert where no one can see it, does it exist?’; just when it became clear that TV communicates more information to more people than large walls do; just when we understood that in order to define space it is necessary to encompass time; just when many established ideas in other disciplines were being questioned and new models were proposed – just then the Portapak became available.292 Radically New Film equipment wasn’t the only advancement that summer, either; the house band for The Merry Pranksters, the Grateful Dead, was coming out of a creative hiatus with a whole new way of being the Dead, and this time its name wasn’t coming out", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634243568_cleaned.txt:148:4c535cddf81c", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 1576, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634243568_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634243568", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634243568_cleaned", "chunk_index": 149, "text": "that in order to define space it is necessary to encompass time; just when many established ideas in other disciplines were being questioned and new models were proposed – just then the Portapak became available.292 Radically New Film equipment wasn’t the only advancement that summer, either; the house band for The Merry Pranksters, the Grateful Dead, was coming out of a creative hiatus with a whole new way of being the Dead, and this time its name wasn’t coming out of Merriam Webster’s dictionary, like the first one. So many had thought the Dead’s name came out of the Egyptian Book of the Dead, that by Quantum reasoning, it became the truth. What does Kesey’s character Chief Bromden say? “But it’s the truth even if it didn’t happen.” And Ken would say: “Don’t ever ruin a good story with the Truth.” But the truth is, the Dead started to create a whole new sound: Blues for Allah was the group’s highest-charting album until 1987s In the Dark…(where) a discernable Middle Eastern theme emerged, supported by Robert Hunter’s lyrics. Non-Western time signatures on some of the material added to the concept, as well as experiments with instrumentation, such as flute on the Bach-inspired “Sage & Spirit” (named for manager Rock Scully’s daughters). Garcia said he was “creating scales that generated their own harmony in ways that weren’t symmetrical in regular, classical major-minor relationships.”293 Jerry brought in a strange, almost atonal melodic entity that would evolve into the title song and sequence for the album, and I had sketched out a little Latin-flavored, seven-beat instrumental number inspired by Shelley’s poem “Ozymandias” called “King Solomon’s Marbles” Besides “Crazy Fingers,” his marvelous essay in Echoes from the Set Vol. II (1967- 1977) – Shadows from the Underground: Cinema Under the Influence smoky ambiguity, Jerry also contributed a triptych of already written tunes (“Help on the Way,” “Slipknot,” and “Franklin’s Tower”) that would become, in live performance, one of our finest exploratory vehicles. Bob had a beautiful guitar instrumental, “Sage and Spirit,” and one of his stompin-est self-congratulatory rockers, “Music Never Stopped,” to round out the album.294 “Consideration was given to naming the album after the Enlightened King Faisal of Saudi Arabia, who was assassinated after recording began. [8] The band had been told that he was a fan of the Grateful Dead. Ultimately, Robert Hunter considered his lyrics for the title track a requiem for the ruler. The song also references One Thousand and One Nights.”295 Drummer Bill Kreutzmann recalled: Once we started performing them live … we turned a corner and it was a whole other ball game.

Once we let them outside and started taking them for walks, they each had a growth spurt during which they really discovered themselves. The album also contained a group of really experimental songs (“Stronger than Dirt,” “Unusual Occurrences in the Desert”) that bordered on acid jazz composition. Wild stuff. Deep cuts.”296 And speaking of One Thousand and One Nights, about that same time, I would try to talk Michael Douglas into producing Chimera, a book written by John Barth, which was a feminist version of the 1001 Nights. Later, I would even make a toast from it: “The Key to the Treasure is the Treasure Itself” to Bernardo Bertolucci, Jack Nicholson, and other guests at dinner one night, at Jack’s House. The cut does not constitute a manifestation of the romantic desire to leave a trace, but takes the form of a wound and refers to the other. It is itself a trace of the other, to which we can be faithful only in this fissuring; thus not making from this wound a sacrifice which has any general idealistic aim.” Premieres as Michael’s guest, and was honored by his seating me next to former Governor McCall Friday night; the next day riding in the limo with just him and Jack from Portland to Salem, where Governor Bob Straub and Dr. Dean Brooks reigned at their Salem Premiere; and then to the Airport to see them and Milos off. On the way, Michael and I took Christmas presents to the women of Ward 84, the Homicidal Lockdown Ward of the Institution we had filmed in. Just remembering the looks on their faces as they saw him bringing them gifts brings tears to my eyes. I had never experienced so much unconditional love ever before. For me, this was the pinnacle of the whole movement that started in the 1960s. Nor had I ever experienced this level of romancing before. Michael was a gentleman who always opened the car doors for me, was always protecting me, feeding me, and telling me how wonderful I was. And Jack was the third entity in our relationship, always providing comic relief when things got too serious. I was already married, and Michael was in a relationship with Brenda Vaccaro. However, we lived in the moment and let what may happen, happen; because as Khalil Gibran’s The Prophet says, “… think not you can direct the course of love, for love, if it finds you worthy, directs your course.”297 And", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634243568_cleaned.txt:150:5e3745fc0276", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 1578, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634243568_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634243568", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634243568_cleaned", "chunk_index": 151, "text": "feeding me, and telling me how wonderful I was.

So in 1976, we found ourselves immersed in the last great days, the absolute “Crown of Creation”:298 of sex, drugs and rock and roll of the 60s and 70s. On March 29th, 1976 when the Academy Awards were presented, Michael, Saul, Jack, Louise and Milos swept the Oscars for the first time since the film It Happened One Night in 1934, 42 years earlier! And then jetted around the world for a year promoting the hell out of it. I got a postcard from Michael in July; they were staying at the Otani Hotel in Tokyo. I knew he and Brenda had broken up in January, even though she was his guest at the Academy Awards. She had earned it, from living through years of Development Hell with Michael. I was so proud to be a part of it. And the film inspired me, by what happened on Cuckoo’s Nest, to have a professional casting file for the next time Michael or any other filmmaker would come to Oregon, to avoid the embarrassment of them seeing signs on telephone poles downtown, like their Casting/Car Salesman had made: “Do you have a face that scares Timber Wolves? If so, call this number.” As luck would have it, I found out that Pierre Dunne from the Willamette Valley Observer had been asked by Dennis Hopper to collect head shots for him, so I was all over that, contributing some from my meager files. Allegedly, Dennis was coming back to Oregon to make Trask by Oregon Author Don Berry. In the 60s, Don Berry wrote incredible historical fiction novels about Oregon’s Mountain Men and their relationships with the Indians, and the Indian’s relationships to Nature. He spoke dispassionately and professionally about the script for Moontrap, which he had just finished writing, and he discussed his plans for directing the film next June. “I should have directed a lot of other pictures by now,” he said, “but I think back to the days when I was broke and then somebody offers me a million dollars to act in a picture – and I’m chicken about turning it down. No one would pay me anywhere near that much for directing. But Moontrap is my own, so it’s different.”299 But because of the Academy Awards, this little film Cuckoo’s Nest, financed by Jazz Distributor Saul", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634243568_cleaned.txt:151:d272dae98e05", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 1579, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634243568_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634243568", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634243568_cleaned", "chunk_index": 152, "text": "“I should have directed a lot of other pictures by now,” he said, “but I think back to the days when I was broke and then somebody offers me a million dollars to act in a picture – and I’m chicken about turning it down.

Also, they all had ownership point-wise, and the more they promoted it, the more money they made. And on United Artist’s dime, I might add, for a whirlwind tour of the world, showing their film. So the production of Jack’s Moontrap was pushed the summer that he was in Europe with Michael, and has never been made, and I don’t think it ever will be. And Trask has had so many people try, including me, (well, on both of them) because they were two of the finest (albeit bicultural) stories I have ever read. Back then, there were so many to choose from, like Rick Steber’s From New York to Nome, that superstar Paul Newman had optioned: Rick’s collection of bicultural stories in Rendezvous, including one that I have optioned off and on for 26 years about Chief Joseph’s Nephew, Jackson Sundown. The New Hollywood had also been making Little Big Man, with Dustin Hoffman; and Paul Newman was making Buffalo Bill and the Indians, or Sitting Bull’s History Lesson. All of these 60s and 70s movies were made only after Ken Kesey freed the American Indian from the Wooden Indian stereotype in his book published in 1962. And what came out of Dennis Hopper’s Trask? The casting files he asked Pierre Dunne to collect were given to me, because the film was not made; and just in time. They soon after became a huge asset for me with The Oregon Film Factory, a new company formed by members of the Original Merry Pranksters; and they needed help getting talent for the local commercials they were doing. They said, “the talent includes you.” But my going fee was $25 an hour, in the days of less than $2.00 an hour minimum wage. That price was a little steep for them, so I traded my hourly rate for an Office in the Garage, which was $25 a month. It was a really good trade for them, because they eventually got a phone call from the Bobbsey Twins (which is what I called Bobby Miller and Bobby Steinbrecher in LA) who were working on commercials, too.

They said that the drought in California had made it impossible for a company from New York to film there, and they needed to find a greener location, really quick. I know the production company was uncomfortable about moving away from their California support system, like all of the equipment rental houses, the casting directors and the talent agencies; but because we were independent filmmakers, a lot of us could do 5 different jobs at once, (I had learned to write content, location scout, cast, do make-up, hair, set design and change film in the bag for a film camera) and so we all were well rounded in all aspects of film production. They were blown away. And when their production manager, Terry Donnelley flew up to see the location, he wanted to see our casting files. And because of Dennis Hopper, I had some. And because I had some, we brought a commercial production to town that left around $250, 000 in the community; and because it was such a huge success, it also brought another $12300 in residual payment to the actors. Plus, we got 10% of it for putting it all together. At first, I was nervous. It’s one thing to put together a couple of girlfriends for a local Joe Romania car commercial; and totally another thing to bring in 2700 actors for a national one to audition; because that is the ratio they told me they needed, 100 auditions for each part, a total of 27 parts in the commercial which equaled 2700 interviews in two weeks. But they were so relieved to not have to cancel the shoot, that they taught me what to do. Lynn Stalmaster had taught me how to audition actors. But they taught Bob Laird and I how to become powers of attorney for each actor we cast, to get our fee. They said we would never see it if the talent got the checks first. By the time we were to start shooting, we had our final picks, including Kesey’s Grandmother Ophelia in a scene at the Skinner’s Butte Victorian Mansion, being pushed by an elderly gentleman in a swing; we had all ages and all ethnics, including the cutest little black boy with his dad for a food eating scene, and with some others for a skateboarding scene; we had a young couple for the scene of riding a horse; we had kids for fishing with a dog on a wooden raft scene; we had a marching band from Sheldon High School (one", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634243568_cleaned.txt:153:0c614b31f253", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 1581, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634243568_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634243568", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634243568_cleaned", "chunk_index": 154, "text": "scene at the Skinner’s Butte Victorian Mansion, being pushed by an elderly gentleman in a swing; we had all ages and all ethnics, including the cutest little black boy with his dad for a food eating scene, and with some others for a skateboarding scene; we had a young couple for the scene of riding a horse; we had kids for fishing with a dog on a wooden raft scene; we had a marching band from Sheldon High School (one of my many Alma Maters) who ended up being able to go to Europe to compete in a Continental Marching Band contest with the money they made; we had kids for splashing in the rain; a little girl who hugged a sheep, another one who was being taught to play croquet by her Grandfather; a Chinese girl and others at a Ballet class; and even an American Indian cowboy with a horse saddle on his shoulder. But we could not find the perfect American archetypal John Wayne Cowboy. I was frantic, because I had let them down. Me, a sixth generation Oregon Pioneer and Indian Rodeo girl who had hundreds of relatives in town. In desperation, I called the Lane County Sheriff ’s Mounted Patrol; which on which their website said “continues the tradition of patrols on horseback by Western sheriffs. The Mounted Patrol supports special initiatives that call for a mounted deputy, like crowd control, civil unrest and search and rescue.” I remember it was after dark when a tall Sheriff knocked on the door of our office in a cowboy hat and riding gear, fresh off the trail. He was just like John Wayne, and he hesitated, framed in the doorway like a John Ford movie; because we were all jumping up and down screaming “that’s him!” His name was Gene Terpenning, and suddenly I had earned the right to be a legitimate professional Casting Director. My J. Walter Thompson and Oregon Film Factory comrades were quite pleased with me. And this is how, in 1976, during the country’s Bi- Centennial, America finally made a mainstream bicultural commercial. You can see it where the links are, on the last page of the book. Meanwhile, Cinema 7 continued to thrive, and after the Burger King commercial, I continued to work 4 nights a week. We were showing Ron Finne’s works in mini film festivals, and showed Don Cato’s Cannes’ Silver Award-winner short called Skinner’s Beaut. Oregon’s own Will Vinton, winning an Oscar for his animated short Closed Monday, had inspired every filmmaker I knew. At Cinema 7, I continued to watch so much film there it affected my vision, but I couldn’t get enough. And Steve Bove, Barbara Embree and I made our own film.

I played a Mermaid who was dying in the Tide pools because her jealous sister had poisoned her, and took her magic Hair Combs. The final scene was Barbara Embree, as my sister, in front of a mirror, trying on the hair combs, and they immediately made her turn into an ugly Hag. I was so proud of it that Mark Rydell set up a screening of it at Fox. And it was a beautiful film, up on the big screen at last, one that I was a part of. It is now considered a “lost film.” I had also visited Rydell on the set of Harry and Walter Go to New York; and became friends with Elliott Gould. While there, I taught Elliott Gould how to do “The Hustle,” which is why he gave me a rolled up “Movie Money” (printed for Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid) and signed it with this: “to spend this you gotta do a hustle.” And the Oregon Film Commissioner couldn’t believe it either, when I showed up with Michael for a location scout meeting in the Governor’s Office in October. Michael was on a new project called China Syndrome. Even though Warren had access to the Governor’s airplane, I was Michael’s favorite location scout now, and I would even scout for him again in 1983. But on this day, he also wanted my input about what women would want in a film, especially since he had seen me one night in an Adult film, while filming Streets of San Francisco. He said he and the crew were holed up in a motel in San Francisco, watching TV, when a show about Welcome Wagon Girls was playing. Suddenly, he said, he saw me, stood up and told the crew “I know that girl! Her name is Katherine.” And the crew said, “Nah .… No way you know that girl.” And then I turned to the camera and said “Hi, I’m Katherine,” which is how he saw me, playing right there on the TV screen. I told him that the book he gave me, Fear of Flying by Erica Jong was right. “A woman’s erogenous zone is in her mind.” I told him about Chimera by John Barth.

Hollywood certainly didn’t want Crazy, Indian, or women’s voices, but he did it, and then he made Jewel of the Nile. I so love him for that, for making these two romantic films with strong women. I need to add that in the 70s the whole decade was about sex. “A new, sexualized popular culture pervaded American life in the 1970s, and it seemed that everyone wanted to be part of it. Watching a porn film at the local theater, flipping through a sex advice manual in line at the grocery store, dancing the hustle at a glittery discotheque – all were markers of sexual sophistication.”300 The sexual revolution was considered by many to be the most shocking social trend in the 1970s. It cast aside traditional sexual restraints and began a decade of alternative eroticism, experimentation, and promiscuity. In part facilitated by the development of the birth-control pill and other contraceptives, Americans in the 1970s broke many sexual taboos. Interracial dating, open homosexuality, communal living, casual nudity, and dirty language all seemed to indicate a profound change in sexual behavior. Sexual activity among the young especially increased. Surveys during the 1970s reported that by age nineteen, four-fifths of all males and two-thirds of all females had had sex. Fashion designers promoted a new sensuality, producing miniskirts, hot pants, halter tops, and formfitting clothes designed to accentuate women’s sexuality.301 “The 1970s were truly the golden age of the porno. This is the only time in the history of cinema where pornographic films were semi-legitimized. ‘Porno chic’ was in full effect– Behind the Green Door was shown at Cannes and Deep Throat was raking in untold millions, and big-name celebs like Jack Nicholson and Johnny Carson were in line to see these films. Legislation was extremely permissive at this time, and pornographic theaters and bookstores were popping up everywhere.”302 Deep Throat was released in 1972 and was made for about $23, 000 . The movie quickly became the most profitable movie of all time (and still is today), pulling in over $600, 000, 000 In the 1970s, it was a commonly expressed belief that the porn industry would actually meld with Hollywood. Bob Hope was even making jokes about it…303 …sexual revolution certainly began prior to 1970: the pill actually hit the scene in the 1960s, Hugh Hefner’s playboy lifestyle before that, and the infamous Kinsey Report before that … you could even go further back to Sigmund", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634243568_cleaned.txt:156:5fc9345fdb6a", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 1584, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634243568_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634243568", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634243568_cleaned", "chunk_index": 157, "text": "most profitable movie of all time (and still is today), pulling in over $600, 000, 000 In the 1970s, it was a commonly expressed belief that the porn industry would actually meld with Hollywood.

In fact, you could probably keep tracing it back and back and back – every trend had an origin somewhere, and that origin had its origin somewhere else, and so on.304 The origin of the 60s and 70s Cultural Revolution was like a good screenplay, 4 or 5 things happening at the same time. In this book, we tried to show the implications of certain theories about our generation, as well as including certain Forces from the Underground influencing Cinema. Underground music, books and paintings, and what we saw in the Plato-cave-like syndrome in our parents; the calling: whether you call it Khôra, Collective Consciousness and/or with Archaic drug use; Quantum Mechanics, Biculturalism, protests against the war in Vietnam, Ken Kesey, the Red Dog Saloon, the Beats, Yeats, Shelley, Nietzsche and even the Atom Bomb, were all prevalent forces. But I personally saw more of a reaction against, than I saw a striving for, because none of us really knew what was emerging, except what we were turning against. And a big part of it was Post-modernism. Post-modernism was ear-marked by dialectics. We felt it failed to create a collective consciousness, like the one we experienced on LSD; the one we experienced when we really loved. That was what our art, music and lifestyle was about, until it went dominant in the national consciousness and culture and became a commodity. And then, of course, it turned in on itself. Post-modernism failed, because like the Age of Reason that spawned it, it was simple rhetoric, not rhetoric like in figures of speech, but debate-like rhetoric in Plato’s logic. In other words, a rhetoric without emotion, academics without a “structure of feeling.”305 A language without a “radical aesthetic”306 or words for The Sublime. I can’t believe how many words have become the opposite of their original etymological meanings, which have created ambivalence because people were overwhelmed by its didactic logic. By the time we got to German Expressionism, Cubism and Dadaism, just words were insufficient to express our existential anxiety, our feelings. Because The Word was no longer The Creative. The word became the Tower of Babel all over again. A sign that the end of the Old Age is at hand, thank God, just like 2000 years ago.

An example of where this post-modernism led us, is a painting by Max Pechstein. I was asked to go see it and write about it for a class I was taking last winter. A class I suffered through, but now I understand why The Jorden Schnitzer Museum’s description card for this painting tells us that it is an “unusual” painting and wonders if it was because of the death of Max Pechstein’s and his wife’s newborn son in 1912. It is unusual because he “tended to paint nudes, portraits, or scenes of urban nightlife, not domestic genre scenes.”307 At first glance it could appear to be a painting of a midwife with a cloth washing a woman in bed before or after the act of childbirth. But upon a closer look, perhaps not. This closer look begins with looking carefully at the choices of the Painter’s colors, the applications of his brush, and then closely examining the Mise en Scene of the objects, the lighting, the poses of the characters, and the painting on the wall. However, the position of the woman makes the likelihood of chairs impossible and created dissonances in perspective with the legs at an odd angle and the perspective of her position in the painting. What may be more easy to rationalize is that she is in a bed, or twin beds pushed together, which may have been done to facilitate childbirth. The position of her right arm indicates ‘Melancholy,’ as coded by the famous engraving Melencolia by Albrecht Dürer;309 but she has no solid surface or table to prop her elbow on, which makes her gesture appear awkward. However, she has a smile on her lips, which creates additional dissonance. Perhaps the smile is in embarrassment, of needing the other woman’s help. Furthermore, the Table Lamp ‘Light’ (that the painting’s title mentions) creates odd-shaped shadows, one is colored black (of the woman with the apron) and in the form of a square; while the woman in the bed’s shadow is more bluish and more natural. There are black shadows under the bed, but none of the objects on the table in the circular light arc have shadows, as if they are not really there, but a phantom of the subconscious of the other woman. The woman on the left of the painting appears older and is wearing an apron and a cap on her head, indicating servant status. The angle of her arm imitates the position necessary for setting a", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634243568_cleaned.txt:158:a2aa1d8d3052", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 1586, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634243568_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634243568", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634243568_cleaned", "chunk_index": 159, "text": "more bluish and more natural.

The woman on the left of the painting appears older and is wearing an apron and a cap on her head, indicating servant status. The angle of her arm imitates the position necessary for setting a heavy tray down. But there is no tray. And what could have been on the tray, appearing to be a coffee or teacup and a saucer or a small plate with a bun on it, is still on the table. Eerily, the painting on the wall seems to have white crosses in the foreground, with green grass in the background, and more blue paint, evoking a Christian graveyard. An incredible contradiction in a birthing room. In Donald Gordon’s Content by Contradiction, he states: “Ambivalence – the presence in a single work of art of two or more mutually contradictory meanings – was Nietzsche’s bequest to the German Expressionists.”310 Even the name of the Dresden painters that Pechstein became a part of, “The Bridge” was named after a quote from Nietzsche: “What is great in man is that he is a bridge and not an end: what can be loved in man is that he is an overture and a going under. I love those who do not know how to live, except by going under, for they are those who cross over.”311 And there are many contradictory meanings in this painting highlighted with the use of Primary colors. The first is the color blue (considered a spiritual color by the Blaue Reiter) against the passionate blood red colors of the bedding. The yellow of the lamp is painted with the same yellow as the table, but the only reflection of this light is one of a flesh-tone color on the one distorted arm coming out of the woman’s right breast, and the hands of the other woman, indicating human warmth between the women where they almost touch. No other form of illumination exists except this reflection and the shadows. That tells us it is not the FACT of the woman bringing a tray to her in bed (as evidenced by the lack of tray and coffee and plate) but the ACT of caring for her in this way. The Fact of a melancholic gesture with the woman’s left arm (subconscious) is in direct contrast and contradiction to her smile, (a conscious Act of Feeling). Perhaps the other woman’s act of stooping with a heavy tray (subconscious) is in reality her subconscious wish she was serving breakfast in bed as opposed to her feelings of cleaning the woman after childbirth. Expressionism viewed emotion with the traditional German ambivalence towards mind/body experience.", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634243568_cleaned.txt:159:80413217d43e", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 1587, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634243568_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634243568", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634243568_cleaned", "chunk_index": 160, "text": "ACT of caring for her in this way.

Expressionism viewed emotion with the traditional German ambivalence towards mind/body experience. More-over, Symbolist feeling was indirect, evocative and generally subordinated to pictorial form, while Expressionist feeling could be direct to the point of formlessness. To this extent, Symbolism fostered esthetic experience, Expressionism real experience. Symbolism stood for esthetic distance, Expressionism for the examined life.313 Expressionism in this painting does indeed examine not only the conscious life of the women, but also their subconscious life. Furthermore, another layer of contradiction in the painting could be a sexual one, in that “The Die Brücke (The Bridge) artists (in Dresden) kept a house-book, inscribed Odi profanum vulgus, in the spirit of the 1886 Nietzsche, and celebrated sex in their art just as Nietzsche had in his late notes published as The Will to Power (I90l).”314 The ambivalence of Life-Death creates a third meaning (like the oxymoron of Love/Death in Tristan and Isolde); but here instead, sexual love creates human life in pregnancy, but pregnancy can also create the death of the child and even the mother. So indeed, this painting titled Two Women in Lamplight may express this incredible oxymoron of not Liebestod, (Love Death) as in Gordon’s work; but Eros/Thanatos or jouisssance/stasis, (Life/ Death) in Max Pechstein’s Painting. The use of primary colors in this painting indicates a kind of primitivism; and the “content by contradiction” creates a third meaning: “Primitivism is a word that describes the condition or quality that belongs to something crude and unrefined. When this word primitivism is applied to the arts, such as the visual arts or music, it can be described as simple ideas juxtaposed with each other forming new ideas, new images, and new sounds.”315 gyre of Aquarius; and comes full circle like a Medicine Wheel; and this is so important I am including a whole page of definitions, many from those theorists I have relied on in this book. This concept all but requires the Bridge between objectivity and subjectivity, between Apollo and Dionysus, between linear and circular, in or to grasp the love created by “the w Khôra.”316 So no wonder we instinctively turned to sex. Sex is what imitates the wound of khôra. Sex was what created biculturalism in its own way. Sex was the answer to symbolism vs. semioticism, it was more than a physical bridge, it was emotional, mental, and cultural connection between polarized worlds.

And all that reptilian brain obsession with sex from encountering annihilation from Post War, Post Nuclear, and Postmodernism created millions of us, to appear as the 7th generation of the great end and beginning of the alpha and the omega – the Great Word and the Great Symbol, a bicultural marriage so to speak. We are the 7th generation. When Post-modernism killed the most important feeling in the world, which is love; it created this puritanical “intellect” that we were revolting against, with Yeats and Shelley and Kesey; and this is why we embraced their symbolism and metaphors, and embraced feeling because we were so starved for it and starved for the feeling of Spirit: The Polish born Berlin author Stanislaus Przybyszewski … was a Symbolist writer who tried to interpret Nietzsche as a Symbolist by changing the Nietzschean concept of sex into the most un-Nietzschean idea of “spirit.” This was a particularly bohemian strategy, because it took what the German middle-class mind saw as a source of the greatest evil and presented it as an exemplum of the greatest good.… In his 1892 Psychology of Individuation: Chopin and Nietzsche, Przybyszewski argues that a mere bodily function can be transmuted, with the German philosopher’s help, into an idealizing “holy way”: Also accessible to art in this macrocosmic view [exemplified by Zarathustra] … will be The Sexual: that never satiated lust which displays only the eternal joy of creation, everlasting self-affirmation, and a big “yes” to all the will’s instincts for personal immortality, for propagation; those spasms of passion, considered as the deepest instinct of life, as the holy way to life’s future, to life’s eternity.317 How did it happen? Why were Romantic hopes for spiritual or material progress replaced by a late 19th-century ambivalence and fear of decline? And how did Expressionist hopes for spiritual and cultural renewal emerge from this pessimistic turn-of-the-century atmosphere? While the metaphysician may cite a Zeitgeist in answering these questions, the historian must provide causal explanations. Without in any way denying the existence of multiple contributing factors, I would nonetheless claim that the chief model for ambivalence in Expressionist art was the influential philosophy of Friedrich Nietzsche. I mean primarily the later and not the earlier Nietzsche, not so much the Wagner-inspired romantic who thought that “art represents the highest task and the truly metaphysical activity of this life”(1872), but the un-illusioned realist whose self-imposed task was “to look at science in the perspective of the artist, but at art in", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634243568_cleaned.txt:161:ffd7f76cf4c8", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 1589, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634243568_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634243568", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634243568_cleaned", "chunk_index": 162, "text": "the existence of multiple contributing factors, I would nonetheless claim that the chief model for ambivalence in Expressionist art was the influential philosophy of Friedrich Nietzsche.

Nietzsche himself said this: “Everything perfect and beautiful works as an unconscious reminder of … this aphrodisiac bliss (Physiologically: the creative instinct of the artist and the distribution of the semen in the blood). The demand for art and beauty is an indirect demand for the ecstasies of sexuality communicated to the brain.”319 This sounds so much like Yeats in his later years, too. Even the dark sexual energies of both Nietzsche and Yeats can be beautifully expressed by the symbolic Hindu Goddess of Death, Kali. Her “…iconography, cult, and mythology commonly associate her not only with death but also with sexuality, violence, and, paradoxically, in some later traditions, with motherly love.”320 If you ever met a Grizzly Bear Mama with her cub, this would not seem to be a paradox. Grizzly males are known to kill their cubs in order to engage the female into ersatz and breeding. She will take him on and win, because there is no violence like violence caused by deep love. Love can make you lift a car off of your daughter, if needed. Love can make you kill, lie, cheat and steal. Love can make you write love songs, become a poet, put your life in a 9 to 5 job if need be. Love is the only true power there is. But you have to risk it, you have to put your heart “under the claw,” you have to appear to be foolish, a clown, a joker, a fool. If you don’t believe me, go listen to 60s love songs. But in 1976, it wasn’t just for me, this love, this fizzure, this “Wound of Khôra,” that broke both my heart and the heart of the world open, and allowed women’s logic and voice back into this world where they belonged. She was reflecting the New Age everywhere, like a magic mirror.

There were even international women leaders in power, like Isabella Peron and Indira Ghandi. This was because our generation, worldwide, seemed to be born to see right through thinly veiled heteropatriarchy-like rationalizations to control our commitment to love, sexuality, as well as to male dominated rationalizations for war: The desire for destruction, change … becoming can be the expression of an overfull power pregnant with the future (my term for this, as is known, is the word “Dionysian”); but it can also be the hatred of the ill-constituted, disinherited, underprivileged, which destroys, has to destroy, because what exists, indeed existence itself, all being itself, enrages and provokes it.321 And this is what the revolution was all about in my generation, because the Cultural, Sexual, Political, and Musical revolutions all came about by hearing the call, trying to express it, and marrying together the bicultural Quantum of Space and the Atom with the Primitive and Archaic. Which once again, really brings us back full circle to Chapter O. The Fool. Therefore, a perfect example for the next Chapter for the next year, 1977; is National Lampoon’s Animal House; because where do you go after completing a cultural cycle that Raymond Williams called “pre-emergence, dominant and then residual? You parody it. And mock all of that ages’ sacred cows with the advent of Disco, Polyester Bell Bottoms, Long Hair and Sideburns on Republicans, and Mass Production of all of the 60s Icons to create and sell these empty shells of their spiritual intent for the masses, who didn’t even care about the spiritual calling we experienced that made our generation. But we now know that this was just a window in time anyway, a presage of what was to come in the 2000s, but at the time we didn’t know that. A lot of us started “drinking heavily” as Belushi put it in Animal House, to try to replicate the “love vibration” that seemed to go away by 1978. But I am happy to report that I was able to experience it coming back again in 1987, for just 3 days during the Harmonic Convergence, and to experience it now as it has returned again, and it is getting so much stronger that it now feels like the energy of the 60s have returned with a vengeance, this time for 2000 years.

Her rebellion will be only a revolt against the suffering.… And her desire will be so pure that it is incapable of being decently implemented. (Dionysus anyone?) The life of which she will be the figure …accepted like the flowers of the desert – ‘resurrected.’”322 I say it’s about time. The fool is the breakthrough of the absolute into the field of controlled social orders. Almost all non-literate mythology has a trickster-hero of some kind. And there’s a very special property in the trickster: he always breaks in, just as the unconscious does, to trip up the rational situation. He’s both a fool and someone who’s beyond the system. And the trickster represents all those possibilities of life that your mind hasn’t decided it wants to deal with. The mind structures a lifestyle, and the fool or trickster represents another whole range of possibilities. He doesn’t respect the values that you’ve set up for yourself, and smashes them. f this doesn’t sound like the plotline for National Lampoon’s Animal House, I don’t know what does. Oh wait! That also sounds like the Merry Pranksters! How could I ever forget, that the connections between this film and The Merry Pranksters were so huge that I undertook a 7-year process to make a documentary about it all.323 Let’s take a look at what happened in 1977 in the world at large. It was the last good year of the 60s and the 70s. As David Getz said about Haight/Ashbury, the early years were Medieval, the next were Classical, and then the whole thing went Baroque by 1969. By 1978, when this film came out, the whole culture had gone Baroque. Here are a few examples of why, in this poster, under the headings of 70s Slang (dictionary) and IN Style: A perfect example was in Boulder, Colorado, when a Monk named Trungpa Rinpoche, who had undertaken a flight to freedom from Tibet under Chinese Communism, and walked over the Himalayas to a refugee camp in India. From there he was sponsored to attend Oxford, and then moved to Boulder to begin an Ashram. By 1978, his Holiness had devised a new Buddhism that attracted Beat Poet Allen Ginsberg to create, with Anne Waldman, The Jack Kerouac School of Disembodied Poets.

University of Oregon Alumni Jerry White writes about that: Stan Brakhage, the filmmaker, told me of how he’d been asked in 1977 to show his work at a benefit for Naropa poets whose salaries hadn’t been paid. ‘I told them I’d do it, but only on condition the proceeds went absolutely to the poets, and not to buy a golden pillow to grace the buttocks of the guru,’ Brakhage said. ‘They said fine, I showed my films, and later found out that the poets’ salaries still hadn’t been paid, but that $200, 000 had been spent to bring in a New York public relations consultant to do a PR campaign for Trungpa.”324 A perfect example of the commodification of the Peace Love and Understanding generation, yes? But before the awful 80s were over, Trungpa’s disciples were dying of Aids. Perhaps this is why the writers of Animal House returned to 1962 for their film, the last year of “American Innocence” to Lampoon our generation. Because I think they knew 1962 was the year our generation really began with the publication of Ken Kesey’s One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest. And one of its major tenets was “Question Authority,” as if in answer to the Yeatsian question of how to “revolt against the Intellect.” This is just like in the film Getting Straight, where Elliot Gould explodes regarding the insipid intellectualism in his Master’s Thesis Committee Meeting, and again in Jack Nicholson’s defense of the attack by Intelligentsia of Karen Black in Five Easy Pieces. Yeats’ revolt against the Intellect was played out in Animal House. And I will happily show you how. to create a celebration of the film in Cottage Grove, Oregon. I called my defense: “Harvard, Dartmouth and National Merit Scholars Write a Script to Lampoon Academia and Corporate Fraternities: National Lampoon’s Animal House.” The first item of my defense was the National Lampoon’s own manifesto: “To nationally criticize someone or some- thing by using irony, ridicule, sarcasm and satire.” So, I reasoned, Animal House is a lampooning of these ‘higher learning’ institutions. And it poked huge fun at their “sacred cows.” No wonder the University of Oregon tries to live down its notoriety as the location of the film. But it wasn’t really aimed at the U of O; it basically came down to this: It made fun of everybody. Because, honestly, we humans need to laugh at our-selves once in a while.

But it wasn’t really aimed at the U of O; it basically came down to this: It made fun of everybody. Because, honestly, we humans need to laugh at our-selves once in a while. We have been taking ourselves much too seriously. My second defense was that I knew one of the writers, Chris Miller. It was Chris who came on board and changed National Lampoon writers Doug Kenney and Harold Ramis’ screenplay Laser Orgy Girls from a high school to a collegiate comedy called Animal House. Harold Ramis didn’t want to be just an extra on set, so he didn’t come. But I knew Doug Kenney from working on the production of Animal House; but not as well as I knew Chris, who returned to Eugene as my guest in later years. Chris was the one who told me that his fraternity at Dartmouth were huge fans of Ken Kesey’s. But East Coast colleges would not allow them to film the screenplay there, plus they were even protested against in the Bible Belt. Which is why they ended up calling me at the 11th hour in the late summer of 1977. They had 3 days to find a new location or the movie was to be ‘pushed.’ As in, off a cliff. When the U of O President finally said ‘Yes,’ they were floored. Why did the U of O say yes? I told them it was because the U of O had esteemed alumni: This was the home of Ken Kesey and the Merry Pranksters. As noted, 1962 was the year One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest’ was published to enormous critical acclaim. And its author greatly influenced Animal House writer Chris Miller. By 1964, when Chris was in his last year at Dartmouth College, Kesey was on his psychedelic bus going to New York with his Merry Pranksters. The literary, social and political world has not been the same since. But at the time, Ken was simply on his way to celebrate the publication of his second novel, Sometimes a Great Notion at a Publishing Convention back East. Fresh off the press from months spent writing on the Oregon coast, this was Kesey’s Magnum Opus about the edge of the “ortidal bore” frontier. Where do you go when the end of the frontier starts turning back on you? You turn back on yourself, you go within. Because consciousness is now the new frontier. In 1964, Kesey was also on his way to wrestle the minds of the “East Coast” intellectuals, much like his protagonists Hank and Leland did with each other.

In 1964, Kesey was also on his way to wrestle the minds of the “East Coast” intellectuals, much like his protagonists Hank and Leland did with each other. Kesey was an Oregon individualist who wanted to take on the machine of civilization’s pseudo-intellectualism. He demanded authenticity from everyone. He said, ‘Spirit is the only currency.’ I say, Truth. “But many a truth is spoken in jest.” To me, he was the Fool of the Tarot Deck, the Joker, the Prankster of Love. And the first image of this particular chapter was drawn by him for his Perennial Hoohaw. In 1976, 10,000 people came to celebrate poetry, music and art with him at Mac Court at the U of O. He had a lot of people following him, including Chris Miller, the writer of the original story that also became Animal House, which was back then called Night of the Living Fires – Chris’ Dartmouth fraternity’s answer to Tom Wolfe’s 1968 Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test about Kesey and his Merry Pranksters in 1964. Later, Chris Miller told me his fraternity wanted to be “beer pranksters.” I flew him up to Oregon in 2003 to be our Grand Marshall for our 25th Anniversary of the Animal House Celebration Parade, but the first thing he wanted was to visit the Pranksters. He once showed me a photo of him with Kesey at the Dexter Lake Club during filming. In an interview here in 2003, he talked about Animal House archetypes, and how we all knew a Bluto, an Otter, a Boon. And I might add a Casanova, a Don Quixote, and a James Dean. But the correlations in the script to the Merry Pranksters was ironic. First of all, the very HOUSE itself was once a hang-out for Prankster Mike Hagen and rented by his side-kick Jackie Springer (and others) because someone had accidently burned down their own fraternity house. This was in 1957, but by the time Animal House came to town, it was a half-way house for Parolees going to College. Truth is stranger than fiction. • It was Kesey’s Arriflex 16mm camera that created Oregon’s first modern film crew.

If you unpack Animal House, you will find in the Betas, minds as narrow as their ties, in crewcuts and starched shirts. In the opening scene, we follow two ‘fraternity pledges’ across campus as they arrive at the ‘Beta House.’ We are introduced to Niedermeyer, who slams the door in the face of Kent Dorfman. He mocks civility as he introduces them to the Swim Team Captain, the Sorority Girls, and the Editor of the Daily Faberian. He and Greg Marmalard sequester them away with the Blind guy, the Muslim and the Arab/East Indian on the Cast-off ’s couch. A black waiter passes out refreshments on a tray, a status symbol of past slave-owners, much like Mayor DePasto’s ‘black servant’ statue in the yard. All while classical music is playing under the footage as a soundtrack. Next, we follow them over to “The worst (Frat) house on campus.” And they get hosed by Belushi taking a leak. They shake it off and follow him in. Belushi wears a Letterman’s Jacket and reminds us of some great athletes, strong & versatile and also stereotypical large and dumb. But when the ‘going gets tough,’ he gets the Delta’s going. Not so dumb. And gets the girl. He’s a leader, who later becomes a Senator. It’s interesting that the Deltas were immediately pegged by the upper echelon of Fraternal Life and their “Greeter Girls;” and then brought to this corner, because back in the 60’s, we flower children were also eschewed by this culture as rejects. We were named freaks, and were so happy to find anyone at all like us. That is why we started things like the Renaissance Fair, in order to find each other within the post-industrial culture, because we just didn’t belong to society, as it was then. This tells me what I surmised about the members of Animal House being a parody of our 60s generation, but not a pastiche; because the film doesn’t just lampoon Fraternal and Corporate racism, it made fun of all of us. Interestingly enough, though, there is one pastiche present, and that is represented by Belushi’s costume in the Parade Scene, when he heroically rescues nearly nude Mandy Pepperidge by swinging off the top of a building Tarzan-style; dumping her into a stolen convertible and riding away with her like on a magic steed, wearing a Pirate outfit.

If we look closely at his costuming (which in this photo is his identically costumed stunt double, Al Mauro) we see a pastiche or conglomeration of styles. Unpacking from top to bottom, we see a “hippie” bandana-like scarf on his head; then on his upper body, from the inside out, we see a 50s era white “starched ‘stiff ’s’ shirt,” covered by what looks like a 60s Madras-style surfer shirt, then a 70s Polyester Brown shirt, covered by his rather psychedelic “tie-died” shirt he wore in the Louie Louie-singing scene. On top of all that is a bright yellow and plaid scarf, with a black zippered vest. Holding it all together around his waist is a red pullover with black sleeves, giving him a “Indian loincloth” effect. To finish everything off, we have athletic sweatpants, covered by tornoff-at-the-knees flannel pajama bottoms, covered with track-style running shorts. This man is everyman, and we all root for him when he gets the girl. A Hero with a 0.0 GPA. Talk about railing against the intellect! I love the shot of him flying through the air in his Converse Flyers, too, which you can also see in the image below: The other Deltas are dressed more collegiately, like Otter, who anticipates a deep religious ecstasy with his date, (sound familiar? He’s just like Prankster Mike Hagen) and Boon, who is reading a Playboy magazine and living somewhat vicariously through Otter’s prowess, while ‘his girl’ is downstairs pouring beer for the new pledges in front of a lit mermaid with breasts made of goldfish bowls. Katie, Boon’s girlfriend, eases the young “rejected” pledge’s nervousness with an unthreatened quip about ‘nice fish.’ She is a modern woman who is the voice of reason until she doesn’t know what to say when caught by Boon sleeping with her professor. She echoes “a woman’s mind is her erogenous zone” with this act. But then again, she is a proto-feminist and saves Boon from the police at the end of the film. But Boon is shaken up by this, as the tables are turned now, and then, learning his lesson, he remains loyal to his girl. Otter is more like a goddess worshiper, as evidenced by his “anticipation of a religious experience”; Flounder has good motives with his childhood girlfriend from Harrisburg, the girl he hopes to marry, but hopes he gets “lucky” with one of the Emily Dickenson girls, representing the Madonna/Whore complex.

Hoover, however, is a brain, sweet and naive, and sexless, and becomes an attorney. D-day is more interested in mechanical things, represents the 50s with his ducktail hairdo, kind of like Page Browning in the Merry Pranksters; and even Pinto goes with his good conscience when his date passes out undressing. How anyone can call this sexual assault is beyond me, a #MeToo survivor, by the way. The thirteenyear-old date, Clorette DePasto, seems to be like myself and my girlfriends at that age, just young girls, who stuff tissues in their bras to look sexier, testing their powers in and trying their hand at seducing older boys. We were the sexually overt ones, and sometimes it created consequences. But in Animal House, in what was clearly consensual before she passed out, was our sweet Pinto who even took her home. For me, this scene reminds me of the time in the 60s when my girlfriends Edie, Mary and I went to Berkeley to have lunch at a “Soul Food” Restaurant called Albertines, in an all-black neighborhood. When we walked in, the whole place went quiet, and the waitress looked at us like Otis did to our Deltas. Like we weren’t even there. The old Indian Reservation stare. I said hello to everybody, but we were not served. Who is racist here? I might add us Indians think “white people are crazy,” too, with their hang-ups about sex. I laughed at the scene with Clorette DePasto, because teenagers are encouraged to explore their sexual curiosity in many of the non-colonialized tribes around the world like the Trobriander Tribe in Papua, New Guinea. As a third-generation feminist, I see the young girl initiating sexual innuendo every time we see her, not Pinto. This was indeed my experience in the 60s. We young women were suddenly pursuing who we wanted to have sex with, not the other way around. Even Donald Sutherland, the Professor, seems to be representative of our generation, a Bohemian who smokes pot and sleeps with his students. That happened a lot in the 60s and 70s. So much so we included it in one of our “adult films.” I kid you not. Otter sums it all up in a soliloquy at the end.

The film is an example of his ability to be simultaneously silly and subversive.”326 “At one point (Bill Murray) even exhorts his fellow soldiers by yelling: “We’re not Watusi! We’re not Spartans – we’re Americans! “That means that our forefathers were kicked out of every decent country in the world. We are the wretched refuse. We’re the underdog. We’re mutts. Here’s proof.” He touches a soldier’s face. “His nose is cold.”327 And being mutts, being bicultural, being penal colony progeny, rebels, revolution-aries, the world’s tired and poor, and refugee’s, in this Cultural Mosaic of America, is what created our greatest strength, diversity. Because we also came here seeking religious freedom, we have a base-line history of Marranism. We, as the bi- and tri-cultural children of the 60s, were the liminal generation. That is because a critical mass of us were lucky enough to realize: “One must submit to Dionysian madness in order to attain the state of primordial unity, a state beyond social barriers and narrow thinking.”328 I will never forget the day I first really knew I wanted to be a filmmaker for the rest of my life. It was in November of 1977; I was at the Dexter Lake Club scene, watching the door while they filmed. Suddenly the scene before me seemed like a messianic one. The stage was lit with red lights, Otis and the Band were lip sinking to Shama Lama. As the light spilled off the stage, you could see that the dancers were dancing, farther out in the darkness, the camera and crew were doing their job. No one had to say anything, because we all caught the Vision. Extras were at the tables in even more darkness, holding their breath, too, in admiration of the Art being created that night. And it reminded me of a Manger Scene; because of everyone’s contribution and concentration on the center of light. It was a magical feeling.

This shot was in the groove, and a miracle was happening, and as I looked at the scene, I realized we were all there together, black and white, extra and star, Jewish and Christian and Pagan; all equals in the moment contributing to the scene. And I knew that I would spend the rest of my life trying to recreate that moment. When we were all one. As Jung predicted, synchronicity became the hallmark of the New Age, and has been the guiding principal in my life as a bi-culturthat began with Kesey’s camera in 1964, blossomed on Animal House and eventually led to a State-wide Industry. My husband Philip went on to work on over 50 Major Motion Pictures and TV series with Oregon’s A-team crew; while I stayed home with my kids and wrote screenplays to be made in Oregon. The same synchronistic force that conspired to put me on Kesey’s bus in July of 1969; returned again and again to create miraculous events, whenever I would be open to it. The first one I remember after Animal House was running into Belushi in LA a year later. He lived in New York, I lived in Oregon, but one day I was visiting Peter Wolf in LA, when we went to Irv Azoff ’s house. Irv lived with his Mom despite being the manager of The Eagles, Linda Ronstadt, and the J. Geils Band, among many others. I walk in the door and suddenly I hear “Legs! Legs! What are you doing here!!!!” It was Belushi, yelling the nick-name he gave me in Eugene. A series of events, including Belushi’s death, conspired to bring me into sobriety. I was then led to find my friend Philip again, whom I had not really seen since high school, after over 20 years of being at the same functions and parties, but never at the same time. A synchronistic event also led to buying our first house on Campus, where I was working at the U of O between film jobs; which were, in the first decade, few and far between, until 1991. While working at the U of O in the Continuation Center I was invited, all expenses paid, to attend the Harmonic Convergence with the Grateful Dead in Telluride, Colorado. This was a 3-day event in the summer of 1987 that heralded the opening portal to the Age of Aquarius, and I experienced, 3 years sober, mental telepathy with my friends in Eugene, and birds, rocks and trees talking to me.", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634243568_cleaned.txt:172:885a9f375b81", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 1600, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634243568_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634243568", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634243568_cleaned", "chunk_index": 173, "text": "in the first decade, few and far between, until 1991.

When I returned to Eugene, I knew the Great Spirit wanted me to return to film, that needed me as Location Scout and Casting Director, and Philip as a Transportation Coordinator, called Finish Line. Afterward, we moved to Bainbridge Island, WA. hoping to break into the work in Seattle, but there was a lot of resistance to us. A Quantum Mechanics prayer practitioner intervened and we were offered three jobs within 3 days. I ended up first working on an ABC movie after intuiting I needed to call Barbara Claman in LA, who just so happened was looking for me; and then a River Phoenix film called Dogfight, and was also asked to be a consultant for Native American talent on Northern Exposure, which led to Elaine Miles from the Rez near Pendleton, Oregon being hired. Philip was also hired on Crossing the Rubicon. A series of synchronistic events led us back to Eugene, where I worked with Mike Hagen and Ken Kesey on their screenplay Last Go ‘Round. After a Grateful Dead show on a Sunday, Kesey was bemoaning the fact the liquor stores were closed, when I just happened to remember that Hoyt Axton had put a 4-pack of his Moonshine-filled fruit jars in my trunk. You can imagine how miraculous Kesey thought that was! The Kesey film project led to another, where I had to research the Nez Perce Tribe. I just “so-happened” to meet a man at a coffee-shop in Eugene who was the founder of the Chief Joseph Circle of Friendship, and he invited me to Tamkaliks in the Wallowas. It just “so-happened” the tribe had lost their First-Aid EMT/Medic due to a death in their family; and it just “so-happened” my partner in the film, Rick Wadkins, was an EMT/ Movie Medic; who showed up within hours. Later, it just “so-happened” that I was in LA looking for American Indian “name talent” to package the screenplay with, and Keanu Reeves came right up to me and talked to me in a restaurant, and Indian Bob came up to me at the American Film Market.

Years later, wanting to attend our religious Washat Ceremonies closer to home, I found a Buddhist woman in red robes walking and carrying what looked like Potluck fare downtown Cottage Grove. I asked her if she needed a ride, and she said yes. It just “so-happened” she was walking out to the Rodeo Grounds for a Washat Ceremony. After I lost Etta to cancer in 2016, I just didn’t have the heart to continue the never-ending development hell of my film projects, and just “so-happened” to be invited to present at Dr. Rust’s Introduction to Film class at the U of O. While there, five young filmmakers needed a professional to mentor them in order to graduate. They just “so-happened” to want to film a documentary on Animal House, and I just “so-happened” to have written one recently. We went on to win two “Best” awards at the same film festival. And it just “so-happened” that my former pardner at the Oregon Film Factory had just moved back to Eugene, as well as one of my extras who was now a well-known director. They both lent their skills to help the student’s film, which brought it up to the high standards of the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, and it was picked up and aired on OPB in May of 2018 to the highest Nielson Ratings in the country during Prime Time. It just “so-happened” that Cottage Grove needed to advertise their “Guinness Book of World’s Records Largest Toga Party” and so they paid all the fees. As I had my whole career, I loved working with young filmmakers, and decided to return to the U of O to finish my degree so I could mentor professionally. It just “so happened” that I ended up in a class with a Professor who was a fan of my first book, and before I knew it I was so deeply committed to the U of O that I applied on the year and half-long waiting list for U of O houses.

Together they represented the current Hollywood marriage of business and creativity. Among the new generation of Hollywood film-makers the combination made practical sense. For the producer in his natty suits to be in league with the wild-locked, bearded, jeans-clad director, his junior by more than a decade, was not at all uncommon in the new Hollywood of the 80s. A similar relationship existed between Steven Spielberg and his business partner Frank Marshall. Both sets represented the new brash younger Hollywood-products of TV and advertising culture, masters of film technology, unidealistic, clever, “bottom-liners.” Like John Landis, George Folsey Jr. had experience in every facet of movie making and film production. Both men could work the cameras, edit film, and even act (Folsey was the hapless jogger on Laugh-In who keeps crashing into walls). Folsey was still in his early forties when he and Spielberg’s partner Frank Marshall worked out the business end of the TZ production. The two teams hoped that with the movie they could revitalize a TV classic with the same success as other TV-revival motion pictures like Star Trek: The Movie. The Landis segment followed the “Twilight” theme familiar to millions of Americans from the successful 60s TV series. It’s about a person taken from their workaday reality into another dimension. In the Landis script this person is Bill Connor, a beer-swilling bigot who, wandering drunkenly out of a bar, steps into the “Twilight Zone” where the bigot becomes the persecuted victim – a “kike,” a “nigger,” and finally a “gook.” As a Jew he’s chased by Nazis in wartime France, then he’s a black man led by hooded KKK men to a burning cross, and in the climactic episode he’s an American mistaken for Viet Cong by American helicopter gunners. The problem with Bill in the first two scripts was that he came across as an unpleasant, vicious juvenile. In Landis’ first draft Bill appears in the opening scene with his friends in a cocktail lounge conducting a conversation that consists of a stream of racial slurs. He offends a black patron. He says, “Niggers in my neighborhood, kikes taking my job? Sure, sure, I’m a lucky guy.” Bill was not a character but a cartoon. He sounded moronic. “Scuse me lady, you got slant eyes? Pow!” After the second script it was clear to the Warner people involved in the TZ production that a person like Bill was too bigoted to make good box office. Landis also came to realize that his character had absolutely no redeeming value whatsoever. He had to somehow “soften up” the bigot, and so in the third script,", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634243667_cleaned.txt:0:308d3bb55549", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 1604, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634243667_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634243667", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634243667_cleaned", "chunk_index": 1, "text": "I’m a lucky guy.” Bill was not a character but a cartoon.

Landis also came to realize that his character had absolutely no redeeming value whatsoever. He had to somehow “soften up” the bigot, and so in the third script, guarded by Alpha Campbell, Landis added a couple of children in the film’s finale. Bill rescues two Vietnamese children while being chased by a machinegunning Huey. He’s in a Vietnamese village – it’s the “Twilight Zone” –and the village is being bombed by Americans. This episode, which did not appear in the previous scripts, ends dramatically: Suddenly LOUD NOISE and WIND as a HUEY HELICOPTER hovers over the village. Bill stands as both kids cling to him in terror. Bill (shouts) Help us! I’ve got children down here. Bill waving his arms. The machine gun mounted in the copter opens fire on Bill. He grabs the kids and runs for cover. Bill (screaming) Stop it! I’ve got children here! Stop it! Stop! Bill clutching the kids crouches behind one of the huts. The helicopter turns on a powerful spotlight and hovers over the village sweeping it with its beam. With the helicopter chase scene involving Bill and the kids and an exploding village, Landis in his third draft had achieved the missing human element. This climactic scene was not scheduled to be filmed until the end of the 12th and final shooting day of the Landis segment- Wednesday night, July 21, 1982. That night had been declared crew night by Landis and Folsey because it was the “wrap,” the traditional wrapping up of the shooting. The wrap never came off that night because of delays. There was a problem with a dolly shot and problems with the children selected for the job of “softening” Bill, six-year-old Renee Chen and seven-year-old Myca Dinh Le. Mrs. Chen, the mother of Renee, grew concerned towards midnight. Together with her husband and the parents of Myca, she looked on at the mysterious business of the set. In broken English she asked Folsey, “When they start filming our two children?” He replied, “Just be patient. When the time comes, I’ll let you know.” Folsey then took the two sets of parents in tow to John Landis’ trailer where they met Belinda Folsey, his wife, with their son and one of the son’s friends. The Chens and Les were introduced to Deborah Landis, the show’s costume designer and director’s wife, and to Rachel, her two-month-old baby.

When the children were finally called it still took several hours before they were done. Not being professional studio children – they belonged neither to the Screen Actors Guild nor to the Screen Extras Guild – this was their first experience on a motion picture set – and they were shy because of all the novelty and strangeness. The two little amateurs were unimpressed by the gravity of the clock that ticked away production time. Giggling and smiling, they did the scene again and again, finally getting it right as the clock ticked towards dawn at 4 : 30_(A.M) . The director in his drive for authenticity may have been able to create the illusion on an indoor set but would have found it impossible for his galaxy of special effects. As the children shyly smiled and giggled and other production problems piled up, the Wednesday night ran out of “night,” and the production schedule was extended by an additional day. In the director’s mobile trailer about a mile from the set the children’s parents had already been waiting some ten hours. Christopher Le, Myca’s little brother younger by two years, was there as backup. The spectators at crew night, including the Folsey and Landis children, had gone home disappointed. Just before the studio driver took the children and their parents home, around 5 a.m., Folsey returned to the trailer and gave the father of Myca an envelope with the names Daniel and Kim written on it; inside the envelope were five $100 bills. Mrs. Chen received an envelope with the name of Mitsui Manufacturers Bank of Beverly Hills on it; inside were also five $100 bills. There were no receipts or stubs indicating dates or hours worked. Folsey instructed the parents not to tell anyone they got paid and just say, if asked, that they were helping out a friend. Would they please allow him to bring the children back to finish the filming the following night? he filming schedule was crowded on the rolled-over final night of shooting at Indian Dunes, Thursday, July 22, 1982. The four scenes remaining to be filmed included three that were key to the whole film. They comprised the second part of the Vietnam sequence.

He then begins his second encounter with Americans as a helicopter appears over the cliff with a terrifying spotlight. The sequence that night ends with Vic stashing the children in a hut while alone he faces the descending helicopter. The shooting of the rest of that sequence was pushed over to Thursday. Three shots were filmed that Thursday night. They took place at 9:30, 11:30 and the last, the biggest shot of the entire Landis segment, did not occur until 2:20 in the a.m. of the following day, July 23. The first shot that evening was the “rescue” sequence in which Bill goes back to the hut, picks up the kids one under each arm and begins his dash across the river while being chased by the Huey. The 11:30 shot saw Bill’s “rage” when he realizes that the descending helicopter has not come to rescue him but to attack him as the enemy, showering him with rockets and machine gun fire. The 2:20 shot saw Vic with the kids, still under fire from above and with the village exploding behind them, complete his dash across the river by running out of the frame. In the editing room the rescue scene would be spliced onto the final shot, so that in the completed film movie audiences first saw “rage,” followed by “rescue” and then the dash across the river against the backdrop of the “exploding village.” There was actually a final scene 33 to be shot that same night – the fourth scene – a flashback to an earlier Nazi chase scene in which Bill, while hiding inside a wooden shed with the kids following their escape from the helicopter, is pulled out of the Vietnam war zone, a la “Twilight Zone,” by Nazi hands reaching inside the shed. It was a very brief sequence. Because of the necessity of capturing the film’s spectacular shots – both complex as well as dangerous, involving the maneuvering of a giant Huey helicopter and super realistic special effects explosions, two extra crews of cameramen had been added for the Vietnam sequences to the three already there. Four new FSOs, fire safety officers, appeared on the set for the last day of shooting, joining two FSOs already present.

The additional officers had been specifically requested by Paul Stewart, the special effects (SFX) coordinator on the Landis segment. Short, balding, with gold-rim glasses, Paul Stewart seemed perennially preoccupied behind a vaguely wistful smile. Stewart had 22 years’ experience in the business. He was holder of the highest-level pyrotechnic-explosives license granted by the state of California, the A-card, as it was called, which allowed him to operate in the hazardous field of Hollywood special effects. Stewart was concerned that the original two FSOs would be inadequate to control the fire fallout, and together with Landis’ location manager, Dick Vane, he made a scouting trip to the Indian Dunes location before shooting started. To create the illusion of military-like explosions the movie makers planned to use fireballs ignited from oddlooking metal containers called “mortars”-thick metal-walled pot-like contraptions that come in two types: round, which gives the explosives a straight-up effect, and square, which gives a scattered dispersal effect. Whether the fireballs went straight up or fanned out was important to the visual canvas Landis wished to create on film. At the location Stewart described the destruction his combustibles would rain on the village and Vane had agreed that the size and volume of the explosives called for by the script required substantially more firefighting muscle than two FSOs could provide. At the LA fire department, DeWitt Morgan, a seasoned observer of hundreds of incendiary movie sets, issued the fire permits for the use of SFX on movie locations. Earlier Vane had obtained from Morgan the fire permits for the Landis segment, as well as the two FSOs, retired firefighters that the studio paid $15.75 an hour to be on special effects locations. But Vane returned to the fire department after his talk with Stewart about the size of the fireball explosions expected to go off in the mock village. DeWitt Morgan agreed to send an additional four FSOs. Four of the six FSOs were to be stationed with their tanks, hoses and water trucks above the village atop the cliff with its mesa of dry, easily inflammable brush where the danger of a summer wildfire from fireballs leaping up to 150 ft. seemed greatest. The movie makers assured Morgan that no special effects mortars would be placed inside any of the huts in the village. A retired fireman himself, DeWitt Morgan was curious to see the kind of SFX that needed six FSOs – an almost unprecedented number for a single shooting. He traveled to Indian Dunes and attended the aborted Wednesday night shooting in the hope of being taught something.

The huge gasoline explosions would be the “first really big ones” in his experience. But like the guests at crew night with whom he mingled, DeWitt Morgan went home disappointed very late that evening as the promised fireballs, due to “production difficulties,” failed to materialize. The next night, Thursday night, July 22, at 11:30 on the dot, the shooting call for the “rage scene” went out from the 1st assistant director. For the evening’s second shot the voice of Elie Cohn, rich in guttural inflections of his native Hebrew, once again barked over the walkie-talkies at scattered points in the night. The call for the 11:30 rage scene set in motion hundreds of hands to create the illusion. On the TZ set the two Hollywood stuntmen with combat-blackened faces, the camera operators with their assistants, gaffers, gofers, grips and best boys, the script supervisor, the set designer and the location manager, Folsey and Frank Marshall, the director and the firemen, production assistants and assistant directors – an odd and voluminous lot, including some fifty spectators, was active in and around the village scene. There were no stars in the conventional sense. As with the big Spielberg and Lucas blockbusters of recent years, the stars were spectacular visual effects. On the Landis set the stars were the five powdermen that encompassed the SFX crew under coordinator Paul Stewart, Harry Stewart (no relation to Paul), Kevin Quibell, Jerry Williams and James Camomile. They held panels-firing boards from which emanated wires. These firing boards gave the SFX crew the awesome power to make the earth erupt, to draw fire from the skies, to fire bullets, squibs and bombs like the wrath of Armageddon. The helicopter pilot, Dorcey Wingo, was a Vietnam veteran who had flown Hueys during the real war in Southeast Asia. Prior to the 11:30 shooting call he was downstream at the dam with his UH-1B “Huey” military-type chopper. A makeshift helipad had been built by the dam where Wingo, wearing his military uniform with the captain’s bars, waited for the mock battle to begin. The dam, like the Vietnamese village, was a Hollywood creation. Several days earlier it had arisen in the narrow, shallow portion of the Santa Clara River so that on film the meager stream would appear much larger, giving the impression in the climactic scene that Bill is crossing a broad body of water.

Like the pilot waiting at the dam, a number of people involved in the production were not visible in the immediate neighborhood of the village set. Two firemen, Jack Tice and Jack Rimmer, were posted at set level. The other four – Willard Major, Francis Groat, Richard Ebentheuer and their supervisor George Hull – had gone up the cliff with the water truck and other fire-fighting equipment. Five camera crews were assigned to this second shot of the night, which was to see Bill’s “rage” (the full complement of six would be in use at 2:20). At 11:30 Michael Scott on Camera D was up on the cliff, shooting down on the village. Shooting down from the helicopter, Camera E was operated by Roger Lee Smith, the helicopter cameraman from the Air Wolf TV series. Smith, assisted by Randy Robinson, had to aim his lens from the hovering chopper a mere 30-40 feet above the main character as he rages on the shoreline. Camera C in the river was operated by John Connor with his assistant Lee Redmond. Both were standing in the water behind cameras mounted on tripods. Still-cameraman Morgan Renard, in position to aim his 35- mm. lens from directly across tide village, was standing by the Chapman crane, a 13-ton truck specially built for the movie industry with a giant arm, at the end of which a platform swings cameramen into overhead positions. The Chapman crane would be used to swing Steve Lydecker, Camera ‘B’, over the exploding village at 2:20. The crane was not needed for the rage scene and Lydecker, instead, stood knee-deep in water with his ‘B’ camera opposite the village, getting the broad frontal perspective, the “master shot,” which established geographically all the visual elements in the frame; the explosions, the helicopter and Vic Morrow. Set designer Richard Sawyer stood close by looking on. Sawyer with his greensman, Jerry Cutten, had prepared for the 11:30 scene by going around straightening the “eukie” (eucalyptus) poles and the matting on the huts. Earlier at 9:30 during the first shot that evening, the rescue sequence, the helicopter propwash had introduced considerable dishevelment in the arrangement of bamboo, palm fronds and bushes.

A youthful-looking art school graduate, Richard Sawyer belonged to the set’s managing elite, but ironically, in the aftermath of the crash, it was largely through recollections from marginal employees like the greensman that the set at Indian Dunes was to become characterized as having been a strange and dangerous place. From the set’s nameless ranks would come a spooky tale rife with near misses and brushes and narrow escapes, prefiguring the set’s final doom, as if the spell of the Twilight Zone story had become fact. The greensman himself had a close call. Earlier during the filming, busy clearing some foliage obstructing the angle of a shot, he was cutting into some branches with a power saw when all at once he found himself inside a cloud of sparks; it was only because someone yelled out – as it were, breaking the spell – that he stopped cutting through the sizzling cable that connected with a high-power tension line, a mere quarter-inch short of electrocuting himself! The greensman’s boss, who had drawn up the jungle settlement, was perhaps more than anyone familiar with the look of the village, and any other detail of the film’s scenic background. There were two rows of huts; seven in the back row built against the cliff and four at the shoreline, prominent among which was the “drying hut.” Richard Sawyer had the village sketched out by his staff of artists in a series of illustrations and storyboards of the shots, very much like a series of cartoons, up to the huts exploding. Like the other departments on the film, his own had felt the squeeze of a tight budget. With ampler funds he might have built the village not out of hardwood but out of balsa, which he would have preferred knowing that explosions were going off. He tried to cut costs in other ways by having the illustrators do their sketches and storyboards out of his own crowded North Hollywood garage. Each of the eleven different huts was illustrated to scale, and from the set designer’s garage a stream of visual representations, based on ideas from the script and talks with the director, had gone out to Landis’ office. Sawyer had seen the village grow from a series of sketches to a peaceful little settlement and later that night he was to witness its fiery destruction, like George Folsey Jr., Sawyer didn’t have to be on the set that night. He came to help out in view of the fact that they had only one greensman, and to share, as well, the excitement of the spectacular fireballs and the wrap party afterwards.

Some time ago he had missed his first opportunity of working with Steven Spielberg on Poltergeist because of another commitment. He was glad that with the TZ movie the opportunity had come again, in addition to working with Spielberg’s co-producer, the famous director of Animal House. Not being needed for the 11:30 scene, Myca and Renee remained in the director’s trailer with their parents, a mile or so distant from the hubbub on the set. In the trailer Hilary Leach, a young director-trainee from the Director’s Guild working closely with the 2nd assistant director, took the wet costumes from the first shot off them to dry. During the 9:30 scene both Myca and Renee were surprised when they slipped from Vic Morrow’s arms as he entered the river to create the establishment shot. This prompted the inexperienced young actors to cry, thinking they had made a mistake. After John Landis reassured his hidden cargo, the children were then allowed to rest until the trainee would awaken them and help them put on their dried costumes for the final shot. The children knew Hilary Leach as the “lady with the walkie-talkie.” At 11:30 Vic Morrow waited in the Vietnamese village for the director’s cue. Though in a jungle setting, he was still dressed in the blue plaid suit, white shirt, brown shoes and brown socks, the same outfit Bill wore in the cocktail lounge scene opening the segment and worn subsequently through his vicissitudes as kike, nigger, and now as gook. Bill’s disheveled, weary appearance resulted from the combined labors of Virginia Kearns, the hairdresser, and the makeup artist, Melanie Levitt. But under his square-jawed profile and blocky build, Bill was recognizable as Vic Morrow who during the 60s had portrayed Sgt. Chip Saunders, the gritty unshaven tough guy with a human heart in TV’s successful Combat series. Morrow had been happy about getting the role in the Landis segment. As a Hollywood actor he had never risen higher than a typecast GI in a string of unmemorable black-and-white B movies, mostly made in the 50s. Television had briefly resuscitated his career with Combat, but when the show went off the air in 1966 the jobs became scarce.

He was grateful to Landis for giving him the part and the chance for a fresh comeback. His central role promised to give him a great deal of exposure. Nevertheless, the job proved a punishing ordeal. He was 50 years old and he suffered through the action stunts, some of which he performed himself rather than Gary McLarty, his double, a professional Hollywood stuntman. Vic Morrow was without the power of the Hollywood star. The director made the case convincingly for authenticity, and Morrow, like his movie soldiers, groused but did as he was told. He did not want to be difficult. He wanted to strike up a good rapport with the wunderkind directors. These young men with their beards and spectacles and savvy, who were children when they watched him on television, were the rising power, he surmised. The previous 12 days of shooting had been hard on him. The first week on the set he hurt himself in an action stunt where Bill, going into another dimension, turns into a Jew hunted by Nazis: Morrow gritted his square jaw and limped for a day. Also, his gums were bothering him all week and he suffered from a skin condition that was aggravated by the wet-suit he wore in a scene where he stood in snake-infested water during the first part of the Vietnam sequence. On the final night of shooting, he appeared to be worried. Having fought many movie battles, Morrow knew something about the fiery devices used on the set to simulate the look of combat. Earlier that Thursday night he was seen pacing the fake village front. He wandered around the huts. He looked down into the murky Santa Clara. He appeared to be nervously lingering at the foot of the cliff. It was as if he felt something wasn’t right. W hen Dan Allingham hired on with Landis, George Folsey Jr.quickly filled him in on the overriding necessity of cuttingcosts. As unit production manager, Allingham’s job was to make the deals, hiring, renting and leasing everything in the way of crews, props and vehicles. Folsey stressed to Allingham the “tightness” of the budget; even though budgeted by Warner, they had to use the cost-cutting techniques of an “independent.” Allingham had a non-studio background; having worked in many nonunion productions, mostly commercials, he was used to the more “seat of the pants” type operations, and whether it was a generator, a honey-wagon or the Chapman crane, he always got the best deal. But on the Twilight Zone with both Frank Marshall, the executive producer, and George Folsey Jr., Landis’ associate producer,", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634243667_cleaned.txt:9:2ba79186e13e", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 1613, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634243667_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634243667", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634243667_cleaned", "chunk_index": 10, "text": "of the budget; even though budgeted by Warner, they had to use the cost-cutting techniques of an “independent.” Allingham had a non-studio background; having worked in many nonunion productions, mostly commercials, he was used to the more “seat of the pants” type operations, and whether it was a generator, a honey-wagon or the Chapman crane, he always got the best deal. But on the Twilight Zone with both Frank Marshall, the executive producer, and George Folsey Jr., Landis’ associate producer, looking closely over his shoulder he felt the extra pressure to keep spending down, part of a general frantic push to bring in the picture under budget. Shortly after coming on board he had to line up the segment’s major piece of equipment. Allingham first notified Clay Wright, a well-known helicopter outfit in Long Beach, much used by the film industry. Allingham represented himself to Wright as working for Fly By Night, the name John Landis had given his company that was to produce his segment of the TZ movie. Clay Wright had just done a helicopter scene in the James Glickenhaus-directed action film, The Exterminator, the model for all the Vietnam/helicopter movies, including Landis’ own. In fact, the helicopter stunt Wright had performed in The Exterminator was not only shot at the same Indian Dunes location but was nearly identical to the one planned for the Landis segment. Wright sent in his bid to Landis’ Building 71 on the Universal lot. He charged $1200 an hour with a three-hour minimum. Allingham next went to National Helicopter’s Dick Hart. Since 1957, Hart’s company had provided helicopters, pilots and helicopter SFX to many Hollywood productions, including all the Mash shows, Tora Tora Tora, Funny Girl, Thunderball, King Kong, The Graduate, and its most famous client of all, Steven Spielberg for Close Encounters. Hart had previously supplied Allingham with helicopter equipment for some commercials; Allingham now asked him for rates on the chopper, a movie pilot, camera mounts and a Nite-Sun, a spotlight with a powerful glare used on police helicopters. Allingham told Hart the Nite-Sun was to be used to shine a light down on Vic and the kids in the dramatic exploding village scene. Hart happened to have the same Nite-Sun Spielberg used in Close Encounters in the famous shot where the light shines down on Richard Dreyfuss and his car gets lifted up. Hart came in considerably under Clay Wright at $900 -an-hour with a three-hour minimum; but in the end the aircraft lease agreement Allingham signed was neither with the experienced Wright nor the seasoned Hart, but with Dorcey Wingo, a Vietnam combat pilot who was inexperienced flying on a Hollywood set but anxious to do stunt work in movies. Dorcey Wingo wanted to bring more movie work to Western Helicopter, which felt it hadn’t been getting its share and had been advertising in studio magazines.

Dorcey Wingo wanted to bring more movie work to Western Helicopter, which felt it hadn’t been getting its share and had been advertising in studio magazines. Western Helicopter came in with a rock-bottom bid of $800 an hour with the same three-hour minimum, including a standard SAG (Screen Actors Guild) contract for the pilot. The day Allingham discovered the best deal was July 14, a Wednesday, exactly one week before the dramatic scene was to be shot. He went out to Western Helicopter’s maintenance yard in Rialto, 60 miles southeast of Los Angeles, and met the VP, who was also the pilot with the fitting flying man’s name. Dorcey Wingo had originally gotten into the Screen Actors Guild through one of Hollywood’s most famous stunt pilots, Art Scholl, who had flown one of Western’s helicopters in the movie Blue Thunder (and was to die three years later in a mysterious and still unsolved airplane accident during the filming of Top Gun). Dorcey Wingo came from Oklahoma. He was of medium height, with sharp features, brown hair and a brown droopy mustache. He still had slow laconic country ways and made his own wry comments on humanity with his hobby of drawing caricatures and cartoons. Wingo had a license for flying rotorcraft, having logged 4,400 hours, including 800 in the UH-1 series Bell aircraft, mostly in Vietnam. Currently he had been relying mainly on heavy lift operations. Allingham inspected the Bell UH-1B and gave his approval. It was a deal. They shook on it. Wingo was happy. He saw the opportunity of breaking into Hollywood. Allingham, on his way out of Western’s office, spotted a display of snazzy Ray-Ban sunglasses for sale on the counter and picked up a pair, casually promising Wingo he would take care of payment at some other time. It was perhaps the price Western had to pay for getting in the movie business, because the snazzy Ray-Bans were never paid for. The only problem with the Western deal was that it didn’t come with the Nite-Sun. Only Hart’s National Helicopter had that powerful searchlight available for movie work. Allingham came back to Hart and asked him to rent out solely the Nite-Sun. For Hart there was no money in it without the rest of the package, but he relented and Allingham finally got the deal. Allingham told Hart they were going to use the Nite-Sun to create the fear of the “police state” in the film with that light shining down.

But as Allingham had no experience operating the Nite-Sun, Hart offered to do the job for a fee, a job he had done on many films before. The UPM, however, decided to operate the light himself in the critical exploding village scene, even though Hart insisted that to keep the light on one point with the helicopter moving took some practice. Dan Allingham was in his early thirties and stood about 5 ft. 4. With a longish-in-the-neck pageboy and a mustache and beard, he had the look of an early Beatle. He grew up in San Pedro where his parents ran a momand-pop bar & grill. He drifted into the production end of film making after hiring out as an actor on the strength of a high school play. But after a brief struggle in Chicago confronted him with the choice between “acting and eating,” as he put it, he got into film production in 1978 working on a TV movie called Ishi by Edward and Mildred Lewis, the makers of Reuben, Reuben, on which he had the job of UPM (unit production manager). Just weeks before the film was scheduled to begin production, George Folsey Jr., agreeing with his creative partner in the manner of softening up Bill, set out to find the two Asian children that were to realize the director’s visual imagery on the screen. Typically, a film production turns to a casting agency for the filling of parts. However, as soon as the agency used by Landis and Folsey learned that they were required to cast children in contravention of child labor law regulations it forcefully declined. As the script read, the children would have to be involved in night for night shooting on location rather than in the studio. Landis and Folsey knew that in order to avoid problems satisfying the California department of labor’s stringent requirements, they would have to hire the children without a labor permit, i.e., illegally. At that point Donna Schuman, Folsey’s production coordinator, came to the rescue. Donna’s husband, Harold Schuman, a psychiatrist with the county’s Asian Mental Health Division, was a longstanding family friend of the Folseys. It was not at all difficult for him to find a suitable boy and girl. The boy, Myca, was the son of Dr. Daniel Le, a refugee from Vietnam, and the lovely little girl, Renee, was the daughter of Shin Yin Chen, a Chinese accountant living in Pasadena.

The boy, Myca, was the son of Dr. Daniel Le, a refugee from Vietnam, and the lovely little girl, Renee, was the daughter of Shin Yin Chen, a Chinese accountant living in Pasadena. Like most parents, the Les and Chens were flattered and excited to have their children appear in a Hollywood motion picture. The illegal employment of Myca and Renee was kept close to the chests of Landis and Folsey but, in order to keep it secret, they had to admit Dan Allingham into the plot. As UPM he was crucial in helping the movie makers circumvent Warner’s no-cash-payment policy. He would keep the business of the illegally hired children from becoming known by omitting their mention in the production’s paper-work Warner normally received for each day of filming. But by the time production got under way, Landis, Folsey and Allingham were no longer alone in their knowledge of the secret. The plan to conceal Myca and Renee had widened to include Andy House, the film’s 2nd assistant director. In terms of the set’s power structure Andy House belonged to the above-the-line category staff, the talent and managers, as opposed to the below-the-line employees, the craftsmen, technicians and service personnel. As 2nd AD, Andy House was, after John Landis and 1st AD Elie Cohn, in command of directing the film. He gave cast calls, he communicated between the 1st AD and UPM, he inspected much of the production paper-work and supervised the crew at the wrap at the end of the production day. Anderson Garth House II at 35 bore the unmistakable stamp of the 60s. He was bearded, with soft features and a somewhat professorial harrowed look. He seemed too mild and diffident for the crass industry which, nevertheless, had been his first love. At the University of Southern California in 1967 he was already acting in commercials. In 1970, while a graduate student, he was working at a news station. For much of the decade he worked in TV as an assistant location manager until getting his first big break working with Spielberg on E.T. The TZ movie was his next step up. He was very happy with the way his career was going. He had been hired by Allingham and patiently listened to the UPM bragging about his deal-making. He learned that Allingham had worked on a lot of non-union commercials and knew a lot about getting around unions whose scales, Allingham complained, were too high. When he got the Western Helicopter deal, he bragged to Andy House about it. House read the script in the last week of June and called Allingham back.

When he got the Western Helicopter deal, he bragged to Andy House about it. House read the script in the last week of June and called Allingham back. Since it’s part of the 2nd AD’s job description to work with children, if there are any, particularly in making sure their permits have been properly secured, House expressed to Allingham his concern about shooting portions of the exploding village scene with children at night. The 2nd AD was not reassured by Allingham’s flat reply that he need not worry about securing the proper permits because they planned to shoot the scenes without them. House suggested that instead the scenes be shot on stage, thus avoiding the need for illegality. Allingham merely reiterated that they were going to do the shooting as the script read, on location at Indian Dunes. House called Allingham again a day or so later, still worried by what he saw in the script of helicopters and explosives in relation to the kids. House suggested the use of doubles or dummies for the children to avoid breaking the law. He told Allingham the studio would be in big trouble if they got caught working the children without permits. Again, Allingham made flat reply that they were going to go on and do it, as he had told House previously. During a third call from House, he elaborated that in the several cameras, especially the close-up of Vic escaping across the river with one child under each arm, “the juxtaposition of dummies could never conform to the positions that a body would take.” With finality he said, “It wouldn’t work.” In addition to being a fire safety officer, Tice had the long, official and cumbersome title of “studio-teacher/labor law representative.” House knew that upon finding children working without a permit, illegally, at night, near explosives, directly below a low-flying helicopter, Tice would have to take drastic action. At the time of the aborted Wednesday shoot, when he first ran into Tice, House was the only person on the set to know that if the fire-safety officer discovered the director’s secret he would at once assert his dual capacity and shut the set down. Andy House immediately scribbled a note to Dan Allingham, enclosing it in the production pouch routinely transmitted to the offices at Universal Studios.

Andy House came to his immediate superior, 1st AD Elie Cohn, to inform him that he recognized in the fireman a social worker who could cause problems. Cohn then went looking for John Landis and, finding him busy in the river, related the bad news. John Landis said, “You know, we must be careful and try not to be caught.” Meanwhile, Andy House plunged more deeply into the plot by suggesting to director-trainee Hilary Leach that she help conceal the children. Hilary was in charge of escorting the kids. Her stint on the set was part of an apprenticeship system by which the Directors Guild of America regulates the supply of directors to the Hollywood studios. From that particular point forward the surreptitious scheme intensified and ramified and deepened further. It became a conspiracy – a plot within a plot. No longer did it merely concern getting away with working the kids illegally. With the unexpected discovery of Tice, the inevitable next step was to make sure that he would not be anywhere near Myca and Renee during the filming. Allingham told House to enlist Richard Vane, the location manager who had applied for the fire and explosives permits, to keep an eye on Tice. busily spotting generators, lights, safety lines, water tanks and hose lines. Unless he wrapped himself over the cliffs edge, Tice was unable to see the actual filming of the scene in which Vic first meets the children and receives from the little girl the naked broken barbie doll. Tice never knew that children were being used that night. On the next and final night, Dick Vane convinced Tice that the best place for him would be at a distance upriver, far from the center of the action. Throughout the evening Vane checked with Tice three times, steering him to posts that shared the common feature of blocking Tice’s view of the village and river areas where the children were to be filmed, while enabling him to spot fires on top of the cliff. The plot further ensured that he did not accidentally overhear mention of the children over his walkie-talkie. Andy House instructed Hilary Leach to refer to Myca and Renee over her walkie-talkie not as children but more cryptically as the “Vietnamese.” On the final night of shooting the pressures of the preceding 12-day filming schedule showed markedly on director John Landis. He appeared to be under tremendous strain.

He appeared to be under tremendous strain. It was not just the tricky fireballs, the “illegal children,” the looming threat of a set shutdown by the unexpected presence of Tice, nor the enormous drain on the budget of an extra day of filming of a scene shot on location late at night – all of them elements to rattle the steeliest Hollywood temperament; it was as much the fixation on authenticity, the obsession to capture the ultra-realism of exploding rockets, the drive to give cinematic incarnation to fire and destruction that harrowed his nerves to the point where they visibly seemed to crackle like a fuse before it blows, sparking a frenzy on the set that night. Among the crew many observed a super-charged, raven-haired Merlin pushing and pressing to the limit, working himself and others late into the night. Those who had worked in the past with different directors put John Landis in the classification “screamer.” Streams of profanity and abuse poured at high pitch from the young director; he seemed wound-up, overwrought. The crew watched him parade about the set with his still photographer constantly flashing snapshots of his personal antics. Everyone was discombobulated by the director’s extreme mood swings, joking one moment and viciously berating the next. Just the day before, everyone had looked on in embarrassment as he mercilessly flayed a best-boy. The best-boy, filmdom’s name for an electrician’s assistant, had gotten very upset at being called “chickenshit” by the director and complained to 1st AD Elie Cohn; Allingham stepped in and the best-boy and the UPM walked away together, yelling back and forth. So, things were tense at the 11:30 cue for the rage scene. Everybody on the set felt jittery about the explosives. Though the scene was not nearly as hazardous as the upcoming exploding village at 2:20 – at 11:30 there were no children and only a few mortars while the copter would not be flying as low to the ground – still the camera crews groused about the danger. John Connor on Camera C openly questioned within the director’s hearing the safety of his position in the middle of the river in close proximity to the exploding special effects. In view of everyone present, Landis screamed that if Connor was queasy he would operate the camera himself.

You could say no, but you wouldn’t work the next day. The rage scene called for by the script begins with Bill charging wildly toward the hovering helicopter, believing that the aircraft is there to rescue him. But with his realization that the chopper perceives him as a Viet Cong, he starts pacing back and forth with angry, frantic gestures between the shoreline and the water. Director John Landis is standing opposite the village on the island. He’s wearing waders, rubber boots attached to a rubber apron which, by virtually encasing him in a protective shield, allows him to enter the river. Though out of camera-range, his position is central to the action. As director he is supreme commander on the set. From makeup, wardrobe and SFX people to the camera crews, soundmen and technicians, everybody obeys instantly the commands he screams through his electronic bullhorn and walkie-talkie. Although the scene should take no more than a few minutes of filming, it’s a tricky shot. While Vic Morrow waves his arms and paces wildly in front of the hut he’s also being machine-gunned and rocketed by the hovering helicopter. The director has to position the helicopter directly above Morrow without bringing the ship too close to the special-effects explosions. He must take care not to send the giant Huey crashing into the wall of the 100-foot cliff that rises above the village … a hundred yards distant at the helipad by the dam, the helicopter receives the command over the walkie-talkie … it takes off… Along with a two-man camera crew, the two stuntmen and the pilot, Dan Allingham was aboard with the Nite-Sun. They were lifted upward together with a deafening whirl of the main rotor blades. Besides operating the Nite-Sun, Allingham maintained communication directly with Landis on the ground, relaying the director’s orders to the pilot and crew aboard. Allingham wanted to make sure that the director would, in Hollywood parlance, get “his shot.” Aboard the chopper Allingham told E Camera operator Roger Lee Smith what kind of airborne shot the director wanted. Landis had to have in the frame part of the helicopter and a machine gun and the light.

Dorcey Wingo received instructions from Allingham to fly in from the east side and position the helicopter half over the water and half over the village area. Upon lift-off Wingo rose to near the top level of the cliff, making visual contact with the small bearded figure in waders hopping and gesticulating and waving an electronic bullhorn on the ground below. From behind the controls Wingo could see the intensely lit scene on the ground with its peaceful collection of little thatched roof huts. He lowered the gunship to 40 feet. His main worry was to maneuver the craft clear from the face of the cliff. As the colossal Huey hovered, creating an enormous propwash on the water and shoreline, Wingo could see everywhere around him the wind effect of the main rotor blade. Things were being blown all over the place. He could see the wind shaking the scaffolding erected by the grips and gaffers to support the giant arc lights which made it possible to see into the village at night. Suddenly he saw one of the lights fall over. Smith crawled out with his camera on the chopper skids. Leaning over perilously, he kept his lens glued on Morrow’s movements below. The cues were radioed from the ground. Allingham hollered. Wingo hollered. The assistant cameraman Randy Robinson tapped the two stuntmen for their cues and Gary McLarty and Kenny Endoso at the M-60 machine guns by the doors, in torn fatigues and made-up grimy faces, opened fire. The guns flashing in the sky signaled Landis to cue Paul Stewart and his crew to hit their firing boards. The powdermen on the ground, exploding their mortars, created the incredible illusion that the chopper was actually rocketing the village. The blasts shook everybody aboard the copter. The fireballs made directly toward them. The first to hit the gunship came from the water mortar, a short distance from the village shoreline. The spout burst upward as if shot from a cannon. The Huey was splattered with mud and debris, drenching the cockpit windows completely. Dorcey Wingo, temporarily blinded, thought only of the cliff. Fortunately, his right window was down and, moving a little closer to the window, he managed to restore his bearings. But just as he got his fix on the cliff another mortar roared below. A fireball flashed. In the window appeared a head of flames with radiant streaming hair. It scorched the pilot’s face.

But just as he got his fix on the cliff another mortar roared below. A fireball flashed. In the window appeared a head of flames with radiant streaming hair. It scorched the pilot’s face. Stuntman McLarty became conscious of a heat so intense that he leapt from the open door inside the helicopter to avoid being burned. It looked as if the fireball was going to knock the chopper out of the sky. Wingo shouted into his walkie-talkie, “That’s bullshit!” In Vietnam he had never flown through anything like fireballs. “This is bullshit! This is bullshit!” In the instant he pulled away from the blasts, he saw glowing embers circulating in a cloud of debris that seemed to envelop him. A few minutes later a badly shaken copter crew returned to the ground. The first to greet Wingo as he exited from the chopper, Harry Ferguson, the helicopter mechanic, a specialist on the UH-1B, was worried about damage to the rotor blades. He said he actually saw a fireball make its way through the helicopter’s vital tail rotor system. Even in combat conditions in Vietnam Wingo had never had fire in his rotor system before. Ferguson wiped the mud and water from the aircraft’s windscreen. He took a quarter out of his pocket and waited for the blades to cool off. By tapping the blades with his coin, he could get a fair idea, through the type of ringing sound made by the metal, how critically they had been seared by the heat of the blasts. Unlike the copter crew, the people on the ground could actually see how the fire and water explosions affected the gunship. The tremendous fireballs exceeded by far what anyone had expected. Even George Folsey Jr. seemed unnerved, confessing to his assistant, Cynthia Nigh, how glad he was his wife and children had stayed home. Script supervisor Kathryn Wooten who stood just behind Landis during the shooting was said to have expressed alarm that if the helicopter got any lower there might be a disaster. Virginia Kearns, the hairdresser, was shaken to the core by the frighteningly real display. A little earlier Kearns had worked her art on Morrow’s graying hair, mussing it up skillfully to give it the appearance of neglect and disarray to be expected in jungle conditions. During the filming she sat in Morrow’s chair near the village. After the roll’em call she watched the actor promptly run out to do the scene in which the Huey plunges out of the dark sky and hovers over Bill on the shore.

She saw Vic look up at the roaring craft. Anxiously she watched the helicopter drop lower and lower. Beneath the ship’s shuddering underbelly, the old movie soldier gave a brave performance. His face, showing the marks of combat prepared with grime and grease, expressed bewilderment, fatigue and hope. When the machine guns flashed, he became obscured by a sudden tongue of fire. Through the smoke and water explosions the actor hammed it up magnificently – unless he was not acting – and Morrow’s realistic portrayal showed authentic fear and true rage at what he believed to be mortal danger to his life! The “Vietnamese” alone remained undisturbed by the excitement. Being kept with their parents in concealment in Landis’ trailer a mile distant out of the view of Jack Tice, they were unaware that an inferno had briefly touched Indian Dunes. Seated in the trailer they heard only the sounds of a distant thunder. Before going aloft in the rage scene, Wingo had dutifully briefed the movie people about the hazards of flying low in the kind of scene he had just completed. At a meeting with John Landis and Paul Stewart minutes before the flight, the pilot had been told that there were only going to be “two grenade effects along the shoreline”; and he had been satisfied with Paul Stewart’s soothing reply that there would only be a loud report – ”boom!” Somebody, Wingo felt, must have changed the scene from the way the director had explained it to him. He was mad. Allingham dissuaded him from attending the production meeting; the pilot cooled down; the two cameramen, Smith and Robinson, however, wouldn’t hear of it. Vocal in the desire to be in on a discussion that concerned their own safety, they prompted Wingo to turn again to Allingham with a renewed insistence on being present at the meeting. Allingham made his lone departure from the helipad back upstream to the canteen area where midnight “lunch” was being served. Wingo remained behind near his craft with the cameramen and stuntmen. They were muttering the bewildered, disbelieving, half-articulated phrases of people who have shared a grueling ordeal. Wingo’s face was all red – in fact, the burning sensation from the fireball that had nearly consumed him still felt like he was standing next to a hot stove.

Everybody was still muttering as a truck arrived at the helipad. It took them across to the canteen at base camp upstream about a quarter-mile from the village on the other side of the river. A few minutes ride from the helipad, the canteen served cafeteria-style food which people ate at tables set on the ground. The talk around the lunch truck was loudest at the table where Cynthia Nigh was seated. She was a pretty young gofer, a production assistant to George Folsey Jr. as well as Dan Allingham’s girlfriend. Joining the group at the table, the copter crew made no bones about their gripes. The two stuntmen who’d been through the fireballs looked menacing in their torn and tattered jungle fatigues. During the shot, standing with Folsey, Cynthia had heard him voice alarm at how dangerous the scene appeared. McLarty and Endoso were now actually telling her how hairy it’d been. The pretty gofer didn’t feel like eating that night. She herself had seen the copter engulfed in flames. After listening to the copter crew, she wandered away from the canteen. She went back to the river and crossed over to the village. As she approached the huts the air became heavily saturated with gasoline. In the village she could hardly breathe. She was not wholly unfamiliar with the powdermen – one of her jobs as a production assistant was to pay them – and standing by the SFX truck while chatting amidst the fumes with some of Stewart’s crew she was handed a beer from the truck. While most of the set personnel took the lunch break, the youthful director stayed behind in the village with the powdermen. Technically, according to contracts between the union and the studios, any work without a break beyond 12:30 a.m. would result in pay bonuses to the crew. And though John Landis would probably have preferred getting his shot and having the film in the can, he called the lunch break because Paul Stewart, at any rate, needed time to plant fresh mortars in the village for the final blowup. Together with Paul Stewart and Jimmy Camomile he explored the ramshackle band of bamboo-and-eukie pole structures, the front row as well as the huts in back. They discussed with one of the powdermen placing round mortars at the dam. They stopped at different places in the village, paying particular attention to the “drying hut” on the shoreline closest to where the spectacular action was planned for 2:20.

They stopped at different places in the village, paying particular attention to the “drying hut” on the shoreline closest to where the spectacular action was planned for 2:20. The “drying hut,” near which Morrow was shortly to charge running and screaming, consisted of a four-legged structure raised above the ground, open-sided, with a thatched roof. It differed from most of the other huts in that its floor was built from bamboo poles tied together with wire and elevated about 3-4 feet from the ground. Of the eleven huts on the set, it was the most elaborate. His research taught set designer Sawyer that the “drying hut” with its raised floor was used by village dwellers in Vietnam to dry fish because it provided “maximum aeration.” Ironically, following the rage scene, while Landis and the powdermen were discussing the best ways of blowing up the village, Sawyer was busy trying to put back together again what the most recent blasts and wind effects had undone. He was surprised to see the place so badly torn apart; the air, he noted, smelled strongly of gasoline. Some of the huts were almost in tatters. They were coated with “fire fuel,” a rubber cement much used by Hollywood illusion-makers to give the impression that a whole structure is on fire while what’s actually burning is the glue-like coating of rubber cement. Richard Sawyer and his solitary greensman began redraping the foliage over the huts, putting the bamboo and banana plants back to rights so as to maintain the continuity for the next shot. Meanwhile, Dorcey Wingo and the rest of the copter crew had finished their lunch. It was around 12:15 a.m. Wingo and assistant cameraman Randy Robinson, a pilot himself, decided to walk down to the north shore where the Chapman crane was situated, directly across the river from the village set. As they came around the huge white crane they saw the director standing above them on the arm. he progenitor of the Landises was Oscar Levitsky, of Chubner, a small Jewish town near Kiev, who arrived in Chicago at the turn of the century and changed the name to Landis. He was in the horse-and-carriage trade. He did well in Chicago and had five sons and two daughters who in turn had children, one of whom, Marshall Landis, went to college and became an interior designer.

A few years later they cut their Midwestern roots and moved to Los Angeles. The person who remained for many years a powerful influence in the boy’s life was the family strongman he called Uncle Ben, though Judge Ben Landis was in reality his great-uncle; likewise, Uncle Ben called his great-nephew “nephew.” A graduate of the University of Chicago law school, Uncle Ben won fame as a federal prosecutor in Chicago by serving on the team that nailed Al Capone. He came to California in the 40s and became a successful Hollywood lawyer, representing Eddie Cantor and what were to become his nephew’s favorites, the Marx Brothers. During World War II, Ben Landis even ventured into theatrical production, producing Winged Victory with Hollywood’s future super-agent, Swifty Lazar. In the 50s Ben Landis was appointed to the bench of the Los Angeles Superior Court under Republican governor Goodwin Knight and remained until his retirement a well-known name in Los Angeles public life. Judge Landis kept an eye on his nephew after his father died. The death of Marshall Landis at the Mayo Clinic, after successful surgery for a bleeding ulcer suddenly turned into a fatal hemorrhage, came totally unexpected. John Landis, five years old at the time, responded to the shock by withdrawing into the fantasy life provided by television. He belonged to the first generation who had never known a world without television. Walt Disney dominated the medium, but it was also the heyday of 50s TV comedy and Landis’ favorites were The Three Stooges, Abbott and Costello, The Honeymooners; the shows that made him laugh. The other fantasy escape was through movies with stunts and adventure. They took him away from all the nervous tension in a middle-class, fatherless home and the first time he saw a “real movie,” The Seventh Voyage of Sinbad, was decisive for his entire subsequent life. “I was fighting those cyclopses and stuff,” he was to recall many years later. “I went bananas.” From his mother he received the astounding revelation that these monsters were the creatures of the director. His mother, Shirley, remarried and John Landis and his two sisters grew up with his stepfather, Walter Levine, who worked for the City Recreation Department. Both parents worked and they lived in a modest Westwood home where the center of attention was the only son who with all his brightness and precocity was restless, very active, loud and willful, with all the early makings of a problem child.

Both parents worked and they lived in a modest Westwood home where the center of attention was the only son who with all his brightness and precocity was restless, very active, loud and willful, with all the early makings of a problem child. He developed a serious speech impediment, a lisp, for which he received therapy at a speech institute near UCLA. The monsters remained an obsession and they joined morbid childhood preoccupations like watching funeral processions at the veterans’ cemetery near his home. The monsters were apes and werewolves, and their nervous effect on the young boy so alarmed Walter Levine that he threw out his stepson’s priceless collection of Famous Monsters magazines. John Landis never forgot this incident and still talks about it with his mother. It was an indelible event because he never left behind him Sinbad, The Three Stooges, Walt Disney, the fixations of his early years. Mad magazine was another early fixation introduced in early adolescence. All these influences gave rise to a personal drive to entertain. Soon he learned to play guitar and sang with his sister for money at parties, printing up business cards, John and Joanie Party Perfectionists. When his lisp was cured, in gratitude, the “party perfectionists” returned to the institute to give a free concert. At the same time, he was reading everything he could get his hands on about movies and seeing every movie imaginable. So powerful was the illusion that he could see himself, an awkward, gangling teenager with thick glasses, as part of this glittering world. Seeing for many years every picture that ever came out mentally equipped him with a film library of stock scenes. With a phenomenal visual memory, he would draw on this when in an astonishingly short time he did achieve his dream – and became a director. As a TV child his reading matter consisted of fantasy, mostly sci-fi; he read all of C.S. Lewis, and Dune, Bradbury, Heinlein and Clarke. He wanted to become something more than a Hollywood director. “He wanted to become the great American novelist,” his mother recalled of this stage. But for a while, as the 60s rolled on, Shirley Levine saw her son become a part of the great upheaval of the times.

She and Walter faced the crisis when in grade ten John Landis left the private school he’d been attending under questionable circumstances. John Landis adopted the long hair and radicalism of the counterculture; he took part in the anti-war and anti-Nixon demonstrations; he espoused the new causes and arguments; but he never forgot Hollywood. If he saw every movie on the radicalized UCLA campus, he was still the consummate fan who would receive a pleasure from introducing himself to Buster Keaton in Santa Monica greater than any epithet hurled against Nixon. He had dropped out of school to devote himself completely to getting into Hollywood. At age 17 the miracle took place: he got a job at a major Hollywood studio. While John Landis would always refer to this boon as his “first big break,” it was Uncle Ben, according to a story mentioned by several of the director’s intimates, who landed him the job by contacting 20th Century Fox’s lawyers and threatening that if they did not give his nephew a job in the mail room (where, the judge reportedly said, there were too many minorities), the studio would be facing some legal issues. Working in the studio’s mail room for almost a year gave his nephew the chance to observe his movie heroes, talk to directors, wander over sets and sound stages and, by his own account, read all the mail that wasn’t glued shut. He managed to meet director George Stevens and later Alfred Hitchcock. Finding himself once in an elevator with Cary Grant, he said he almost fainted. It was paradise for the consummate fan. The directors he sought out were the action directors, the second unit directors who filmed the stunts and action scenes. He learned that Andrew Marion, who directed King Solomon’s Mines and the chariot race for William Wyler’s Ben Hur, was hired to direct the second unit for MGM’s Kelly’s Heroes in Yugoslavia. Having dated Marion’s daughter, Landis pleaded with him for a job and, undeterred by being turned down, he lied to his mother that he did have the job and followed Marion to Europe. Marion finally gave him a job as a gofer. On the set of Kelly’s Heroes the young movie buff realized his dream of appearing in a movie. One of the gofer’s first tasks was to find four women to don habits and do a walk-by as nuns. Landis found three girls and put on the fourth habit himself and did the walk-by, which for the first time put him in front of a Hollywood camera. Though it ended up on the cutting room floor, he was also in a scene as a soldier.

These stints sparked the fresh desire to be an actor, in addition to director and writer, and the set of Kelly’s Heroes was a magical place where everything seemed possible. He made two friends who were to have great influence on his career. Saul Kahan, Kelly’s Heroes’ short rumpled publicist and aspiring actor, would eventually introduce John Landis to his first important Hollywood connection. Jim O’Rourke, a tall, blond, strapping Californian who was Clint Eastwood’s stand-in, taught Landis the ropes of stunt work, which gave him entry to the movie set. They shared the same dream, though none more so than John Landis; his boldness and energy were overwhelming and he quickly became the “director.” Landis and O’Rourke spent a year in Almeria in southern Spain doing stunt work, mostly on German and Italian productions; according to John Landis’ later recollections, there were about 70 films with names like El Condor or Once Upon a Time in the West, a movie in which he said he got killed about seven times. Once he had the chance to work with the great French stunt driver Remy Julian on a picture being shot in Rome called The Italian Job in which, Landis says, he stood on the Spanish Steps and got “the hell out of the way of his cars.” A few times he came closer to his acting ambition by having a few lines, as in director Paul Bartel’s Death Race 2000 just before Sylvester Stallone ran him over. He was one of the people who went out of the window in Towering Inferno. In Battle for the Planet of the Apes he was a “human slave,” the victim of Aldo the Gorilla. After that year in Europe John Landis was back living with his mother and stepdad in Westwood. He was full of complaints. In Almeria he and O’Rourke had been getting $20 a fall while a Hollywood professional got paid $1, 000 . Hollywood, on the other hand, was not friendly like the magical set of Kelly’s Heroes. Career-wise, he did some second-unit work on biker pictures. He took odd jobs. When he tried to work as an assistant director, he found himself barred by union restrictions. His two friends from Almeria were back in Los Angeles, too. Kahan and O’Rourke were in the same boat and they decided to create their own employment when Saul Kahan saw a script John Landis said he had written as a joke. It was named Schlock!

Kahan thought it was funny; O’Rourke, according to Landis, “immediately said, ‘Let’s make this movie,”’ and so at barely twenty, Landis became something he thought he would not be till he grew up, a real director. The film maker’s first venture had as its central figure an ape played by the director himself. The ape makeup and costuming job was the work of a young transformation specialist, Rick Baker, who was to become wellknown in the industry. The movie’s object was to capitalize on a fad. “Our theory was – which up until maybe 1981 was sound economic theory – that all monster movies made money,” Landis reasoned. But he really made Schlock! because he had “always been partial to apes.” While putting together the venture John Landis made his decisive Hollywood connection when Saul Kahan took him and Jim O’Rourke to the house of George Folsey Jr., Kahan’s fellow-alumnus from Pomona college. George Folsey Jr., then in his early thirties, was an older and more experienced film maker, a film editor with TV shows like Laugh-In. He had already to his name a low-budget picture, Glass Houses, with Jennifer O’Neal, which he put together for $100, 000 and sold to Columbia. Folsey grew up in the movie business with the well-respected name of his father, George Folsey Sr., one of Hollywood’s original film-making pioneers; noted in film annals for innovative camera techniques and as founding member of the Motion Picture Academy. One of his techniques, since made standard, involved reflective lighting on a subject. Folsey Sr. worked with stars like Lana Turner, and one of his son’s most vivid memories is of going at age 11 with his mother to Elizabeth Taylor’s marriage to Mickey Hilton. With pictures like Seven Brides for Seven Brothers, Meet Me in St. Louis, Executive Suite and Green Dolphin Street, George Folsey Sr. won 13 Academy nominations in an illustrious career. George Folsey Jr. was an only child raised by parents who were old enough to be his grandparents. His mother was of Syrian extraction. They were Catholics and their son was raised in obedience to the church. Not at all a robust child, he was subject to asthma attacks and had to be careful about exerting himself. When watching Laurel and Hardy on television he laughed so hard sometimes he’d throw up his food.

When watching Laurel and Hardy on television he laughed so hard sometimes he’d throw up his food. It was not surprising that he “bonded” to an aggressive type like John Landis with his wild locks who had done horse falls in Almeria and appeared to be fearless. Folsey appeared to be untouched by the 60s. At the time he met Landis he drove a BMW motorcycle and had a preppyish look. He had a pleasant pretty blond wife, Belinda, herself the daughter of a Hollywood electrician. He already had two children when he met the bearded, longhaired young radical with his far-out movie ideas. When they first got to know John Landis, George and Belinda would ride into Westwood on Folsey’s BMW and take their new young friend out to dinner at Mario’s. John Kahan’s introduction was a success. Ignited by Landis’ hyperkinetic enthusiasm, Folsey fell in with the firebrands. They needed to raise $40, 000 to make Schlock! Folsey used his connections. Genial Jim O’Rourke, who had more faith than anyone, put the touch on people he knew. John Landis got his family to put up some money. George Folsey’s father contributed his camera work. But they soon ran out of the $40, 000 and in the end Judge Landis again came to the rescue. He coughed up the rest of the money for his nephew. The judge probably didn’t know that by his nephew’s own account the production stories on Schlock! were “insane.” George Folsey Jr., with his strict moral upbringing, at the time must have questioned the ethics involved in some of the shenanigans but apparently said nothing. Landis boasted to one interviewer how he solved the expense of a car stunt in Schlock! “So, we rented a car from a major rent-a-car company – and wrecked it! Then we said, ‘We’re sorry,’ and let the insurance take care of it.” Landis boasted about getting away with things and breaking the rules with impunity. He told the interviewer that he was only able to tell the story because the statute of limitations on the crime had expired. Not long after they finished making Schlock! Jim O’Rourke was dead at 24. One morning in the shower he made an alarming discovery that turned out to be testicular cancer. He died a few months later. John Landis was a pall bearer at O’Rourke’s burial, one of the many funerals that, strangely, were to haunt his life and career. Schlock! was made for $60, 000 .

But despite the fact that monster movies always made money, according to Folsey, Schlock! never turned a profit. One strange notice following its release mentioned that John Landis had won the best actor award at an unknown comedy film festival in Chamrousse, France, for his portrayal of the ape. But there were no offers and around this time when two porn movies, Deep Throat and The Devil in Miss Jones, were making fortunes, the bearded young film maker convinced the fastidious Folsey that sleazy bars up and down the California coast would want the reels of “Sex and Violence,” his title for a porn movie he started to write, produce and direct. Like the car-wreck, the enterprise again skirted the edge of legality. Eventually, however, Sex and Violence came to nothing; the bright ideas of the makers of Schlock! were not appreciated by the people who worked with sleazy bars and after being threatened by gangster types the madcaps beat a quick retreat from the serious reality of the porn business. For a full year following the release of Schlock!, no one called and Landis was unable to land another job. This slack period saw him blossom as a self-promoter. His efforts were rewarded by two breakthroughs, one in print, the other on television. He was featured as an aspiring film maker in a Los Angeles Times interview which noted in the 23-year-old interviewee a mixture of abrasiveness and chaos, describing the stripling movie director as “given to conversational non-sequiturs, resolutely off-beat gestures and wild-eyed generalizations.” Landis’ exposure on television was more noteworthy, nothing less than a spot with America’s top talk show host. In the latter part of 1971, the wild-eyed young director appeared on the Johnny Carson Show. George Folsey Jr. watched the show live. A clip of Schlock! was run. Carson thought it was silly. Around this time John Landis let it be known that he wasn’t too shy to solicit a directing job; he put out the word, characteristically, “I’m actually horny to do another movie.” The offer reached two brothers, Jerry and David Zucker. The Zuckers ran LA’s Kentucky Fried Theatre. They caught the young film maker pushing his low-budget Schlock! movie on Johnny Carson and got hold of him, proposing their own idea for a movie called Airplane. Landis, consulting his mental film archive, suggested a derivative, a “ripoff ’” of a movie with Dana Andrews called Zero Hour.

Instead, they ended up doing bits from the Kentucky Fried Theatre, LA’s well-known counterpart at Pico and Beverly to Chicago’s Second City and San Francisco’s Committee, a rallying point for the young satiric underground. Financed by United Artists Theater Corporation’s Naify brothers, San Francisco’s first film family (in the 30s the Naifys brought the candy counter to American theaters), Kentucky Fried Movie was made on a $600, 000 budget and became a “sleeper” on the college circuit. The Zuckers eventually bought Zero Hour and made Airplane, which became a monster success. An opportunity arose in 1975 when his agent recommended him to Steven Spielberg, another young director who was in Martha’s Vineyard in Massachusetts filming a movie called Jaws. Spielberg was at the same time planning an upcoming science fiction project being written by Michael and Julia Phillips. The story about an alien visiting from outer space was still in early development and Landis was invited to contribute his ideas. The account of this meeting Landis gave friends was that he spent a week on the Vineyard with Spielberg trading ideas for the Close Encounters project and that in the end Spielberg had a different concept than he did. But while ostensibly they parted with no hard feelings, Landis was chagrined to see Spielberg go ahead without him. The 27-year-old director was in New York and staying at the Sherry Netherland for the opening night of Animal House. As news of the film’s success poured in, Landis was described that night amidst a crowded room of friends and well-wishers as being in a “hyper state,” expressing himself with “squeals, bellows and exclamations,” jumping around the hotel quarters “like he had frogs in his socks.” To a reporter from Interview magazine the newly acclaimed director expressed himself about Spielberg in a bitter vein: “And Steven Spielberg, he’s a fucking baby!” Bob Weiss, the rotund producer of Kentucky Fried Movie, would produce one of Landis’ subsequent films. Friends had earlier introduced Landis to Deborah Nadoolman, the film’s costumer, a UCLA graduate with a degree in textile design who would become Mrs. John Landis three years later. But the most important person he met in terms of getting into Hollywood was the film’s script girl, Kathryn “Boots” Wooten, a brainy, leggy young woman who belonged to a genteel junta of counter-culture film people. “Boots” Wooten introduced John Landis to her boyfriend Sean Daniel, a 1973 graduate from Walt Disney’s California Institute of the Arts.

All were of the 60s generation with strong political activism histories and much-manifesto-ed humanitarian commitments. Daniel, nevertheless, had landed a job as an assistant production chief at Universal Studios. His relationship with Kathryn eventually broke up but he became interested in the ideas of her friend, the director of the low-budgeted Kentucky Fried Movie. Around that time Daniel was about to sign an important deal with John Belushi’s agent, Bemie Brillstein. Sean Daniel was part of the new young Hollywood crop, the soon-tobe-styled baby moguls, the fresh young set that in the latter 70s crowded the executive ranks of the major studios. The studios were eager to exploit a whole new comedy youth market spawned by the immensely successful Saturday Night Live after its first airing in 1975. A migration of talent from that show, including John Belushi, Chevy Chase and Dan Aykroyd, was headed for Hollywood. Daniel’s job at Universal was to bring in the youth-oriented vehicles for the new comedy stars. His deal with Brillstein was for Belushi to star in a film produced by National Lampoon’s Matty Simmons with co-producer Ivan Reitman. They were looking for a director and Daniel managed to sell the producers and Universal on John Landis to direct Animal House, in which the 27-year-old director would be paired with the 28-year-old star of Saturday Night Live. Animal House, made on an investment of $2.6 million, ended up making over $100 million. Despite critical panning, it was a phenomenal success. No Hollywood comedy had ever grossed as much and the movie director was a frenetic, squealing, radical-looking film maker no one had ever heard of before. The film would remain Landis’ financially most successful movie, although as an unknown he was paid barely the $60, 000 minimum established by the Directors Guild of America. What it did earn him, however, was the priceless ticket into Hollywood. Universal gave him a place to work on the lot, a secretary and other support in Building 71, the so-called Universal bungalow, the cost to be charged off, as was customary, against future earnings. Working under the strict control of producer Matty Simmons, John Landis ran a comparatively trouble-free set. One of his few run-ins was with humorist Doug Kinney, one of the three writers who created the Animal House script.

Meeting the highly excitable director of the movie he’d written proved a “culture shock” for Harvard man Kinney. There was trouble over some questions of authorship; in the end John Landis took credit for changing much of the script, although some of these changes were hardly to the studio’s liking. The studio objected to a skit in which a bunch of white college kids end up in a black night club where one of the boys turns to a sorority girl with a question about the name of her major in college, and the girl answers with a none-too-subtle allusion to a black blues singer gyrating on stage, “Primitive culture.” Differences with the studio over the script were to recur in future Landis productions, and typically they concerned a comic vision based on racial stereotyping, which the studio feared would be considered offensive. Animal House was seen as a return to the good old days before the Vietnam war and radicalism. It was a movie about college hi-jinks, frats, food fights and toga parties. It was as if Vietnam and the 60s had never happened. It reproduced the age of 50s television, minus the censorship. The director filled the big screen with the quick action of the tiny screen which had nurtured his most impressionable years. Following the Saturday Night Live formula of juvenile outrageousness, the film with its short attention span was typical of the Landis movie-making style – a series of skits like segments fitted to commercial breaks. Certain self-indulgent characteristics to become pronounced in his later movies were already fixed in Animal House. The director’s habit of putting himself on screen first in Schlock! and then in Kentucky Fried Movie (where he played a TV director who got thrown around a room) continued in Animal House in which he played a cafeteria worker during the famous food-fight scene (though he cut himself out in the end). Another whim that became habit was to use the screen for private jokes. One of these was to become his early trademark, “See you next Wednesday,” an ad-line used in the old Coming Attractions trailers; Landis, however, got it from Kubrick’s 2001: Space Odyssey, where it was a line uttered by a computer. It appeared in Schlock! and Kentucky Fried Movie as titles on movie theaters and in Animal House (according to Landis, “if you know where to look”).

With Animal House, the director also began the practice of putting family and friends in his movies or involving them in other ways. To the annoyance at times of the cameramen, Universal’s Sean Daniel, who supervised production on the film, was consistently treated to a flattering salute from the director in what came to be known on the set as “Hi, Sean!” reels. Clowning before the cameras, Landis would himself appear on film and make a dedication at the end of a scene or at the beginning of one, “This is for you, Sean.” At one point a reel was put together with different crew members and people, including stars Belushi and Aykroyd, chorusing, “Hi, Sean!” One of the director’s cutest bits was to face the camera when something had gone wrong. “Hi, Sean, like what can I do about this?” Daniel reportedly enjoyed his friend’s antics as he made it a practice to view the production’s progress on a daily basis. Despite the phenomenal earnings of Animal House, the movie did not bring John Landis as director the sort of acclaim that was Spielberg’s or Lucas’s. The credit went to the producer Matty Simmons and the comedy star John Belushi (even though Belushi got only $35, 000 for his role as Bluto, the immortal slob). In the end Landis was given two net points that never earned the millions it made producers Simmons and Reitman but still gave him a taste of financial success. Matty Simmons, however, nearly came to blows with Landis on the night of the movie’s premiere and Simmons failed to offer him the Animal House sequel, National Lampoon’s Vacation with Chevy Chase. Landis also had a falling-out with Animal House co-producer Ivan Reitman over their scheduled collaboration on a movie with Harold Ramis; Landis called Reitman a “hustler” because he felt cheated out of the plan for that movie. John Landis spent the following year preparing Incredible Shrinking Woman, which Universal’s executives offered him next. Of course, he had seen the original Shrinking Woman as a kid and while preparing his remake he met frequently with the proposed star, Lily Tomlin, and her inseparable assistant, Barbara Wagner. Landis involved himself deeply in figuring out how to do the most dramatic shrinking process. He was most impressed with Disney’s Darby O’Gill and the Little People, which he screened a number of times before deciding on how to apply the light and mirror shrinking techniques from that film to his version of the Shrinking Woman.

All that time there was no money; Folsey took a job as film editor on a film called Freedom Road and in the end the budget for Shrinking Woman Landis submitted was rejected by Universal’s executives led by Daniel’s boss Ned Tanen. It was too expensive. Landis was indignant about the way he had been treated and the studio gave him instead a film it put together, Blues Brothers. Meanwhile, one result of the success of Animal House was to usher in for John Landis a period of unusually warm relations with his rival and friend, Steven Spielberg. They could meet on something like an equal footing, for Landis, too, was now big box office. Both had their offices at Universal, though Spielberg, who had just released Close Encounters, was indisputably the king of the lot. After Animal House, Spielberg showed renewed interest in Landis, socializing with his fellow director in an almost fraternal fashion that was a far cry from the frosty times at Martha’s Vineyard. Steven Spielberg during this period succumbed to the competitive spirit with a disastrous attempt at comedy. He shared Landis’ enthusiasm for Saturday Night Live and, naturally, after Belushi’s success in Animal House, he also wanted to do a Belushi comedy. While Landis was doing his mirror and light experiments with the little people from Darby O’Gill, Spielberg filmed his Belushi comedy, 1941, a film with a WW II setting. Like George Lucas’ subsequent essay into comedy with Howard the Duck, Spielberg’s 1941 turned out a humorless bomb. At the same time John Landis got his future wife her first job with Steven Spielberg; after looking at her credits Spielberg recruited her and under her professional name of Deborah Nadoolman she did the costumes for 1941. Folsey and Landis visited Spielberg on the tank set at MGM for the shot where the ferris wheel runs into Pacific Ocean Park. John Landis made an acting appearance in the movie. As an adjutant to Robert Stack he played a messenger who rode around on a motorcycle with a sidecar; according to Landis, he spent a lot of time while the filming took place covered from head to foot in some kind of dirt which, Landis said, “Steven” took great delight in throwing in his face before each take. “He’d yell, ‘Makeup!’ and then haul back and – POW! It was like The Three Stooges on that film.” Landis thought he", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634243667_cleaned.txt:34:be1728fd5307", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 1638, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634243667_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634243667", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634243667_cleaned", "chunk_index": 35, "text": "As an adjutant to Robert Stack he played a messenger who rode around on a motorcycle with a sidecar; according to Landis, he spent a lot of time while the filming took place covered from head to foot in some kind of dirt which, Landis said, “Steven” took great delight in throwing in his face before each take. “He’d yell, ‘Makeup!’ and then haul back and – POW! It was like The Three Stooges on that film.” Landis thought he would get back at him by having Spielberg play a clerk in Blues Brothers. Deborah Nadoolman, the costumer on the film, was instructed by her soon-to-be husband to make Spielberg look like a “nerd.” “What’s this?” Landis says he yelled at her when he saw Spielberg turn up looking marvelous. “Why should I let him look this good?”; to which Deborah replied smartly, “Hey, remember, I work for him, too.” After 1941 Spielberg kept her on while doing his next film, Raiders of the Lost Ark, with George Lucas. Deborah, however, had problems on the Raiders set in London. She wasn’t happy and made several calls to her new husband in Beverly Hills to discuss her grievances. There were rumors that she didn’t get along with certain members of the crew and that in one encounter she’d walked off the set. The problem was highly personal and they never told friends but it put a fresh strain on John Landis’ complex relationship with Spielberg. When Spielberg and Lucas’ Raiders came out in 1980 it set a new record for box office receipts. At around the same time Spielberg began working on a movie called “Night Sky” which would become E.T., Hollywood’s highest-grossing movie ever. Spielberg had wanted Belushi for 1941 and got him, and naturally he also wanted Landis’ friend from Schlock!, the same young man with long hair in flowering hippie clothes, Rick Baker, who had done the ape costumes for Landis. Spielberg put Baker to experimenting with some E.T.-like dolls in a North Hollywood warehouse. At the same time, Landis had Baker in a lab on the other side of the building doing werewolf mockups for a project of his own. The competition between the two friends again led to an anomalous situation. Apparently, it was a thorn in Spielberg’s side that Baker had the werewolf commitment with Landis. At any rate, he didn’t like Baker’s E.T.’s and not only fired him but also locked him out and closed down the werewolf lab at the other side of the building. Spielberg had new locks put on the doors and Baker had to move to another place. In the summer of 1978, at the end of its third season, Saturday Night Live ran one of its all-time most popular shows.

Hosted by Steve Martin, it featured John Belushi and Dan Aykroyd trying out a new bit, Jake and Elwood Blues, the Blues Brothers. The release of Animal House in the fall of ‘78 made Belushi a household word and in the fourth season of Saturday Night Live the Blues Brothers attained something like cult status. Steve Martin used the Blues Brothers for his opening act at the Universal Amphitheater in Los Angeles. The two white soul brothers with their porkpie hats, narrow ties, shades and baggy blue suits started a fresh wave of 50s nostalgia. Belushi and Aykroyd soon recorded an album, Briefcase Full of Blues, which, after its release in December 1978, sold a million copies in less than a month. And before the season was out the Blues Brothers were signed up by Universal for a movie. The Blues Brothers represented an ultimate fusion of the youth market – TV through Saturday Night Live, rock music through the Briefcase Full of Blues and the new movie, a musical about two hipsters and a blues band, to be directed by John Landis. Sean Daniel was again the executive in charge of production; Landis was reportedly paid a half-million dollars. Before Belushi became even more famous through his incarnation of Jake Blues he had already been signed along with Aykroyd for Spielberg’s 1941. John Landis had to bide his time until Spielberg finished filming Belushi before he could begin using the comedian in Blues Brothers. Timing was essential in a business of fleeting fads and the studio had to promise the theatre owners that they would have a Belushi release by the summer of 1980. Spielberg finally turned Belushi loose, and by August of 1979, Landis started the Blues Brothers production with a $16 million budget and 16-week shooting schedule designed to bring the film to completion for post-production by December 15 of that year. The picture fell three months behind schedule and was rushed to make the summer release date. Its original $16 million budget ballooned to $28 million and it was said that thanks to George Folsey Jr.’s day-and-night work in the editing room the film got into the theaters at all in a half-way decent form. “The movie was more complicated than anyone thought,” Folsey recalled, giving a small hint of the drug-related anarchy said to have overtaken the set.

Among the crew on Blues Brothers many were aware that drug use while filming was constant, even by production people close to the director. It became the despair of Universal executives. The snorting and sniffing on the set was widely reported in the press. It was an open secret that the sunglasses worn by Elwood and Jake Blues were to disguise the drug-dilated eyes of John Belushi. Folsey’s work earned him both an associate producer title on the film and recognition as a key man in the Landis organization who could be depended on to clean up the young director’s mess. But there was little Folsey could do about the star whose monster success had bred a monster appetite for cocaine that was soon to kill him. Crew members on the film who witnessed Belushi stumbling all over himself found it excruciating to watch the overweight, drug-ravaged actor. It was said that John Landis alone was able to handle the “monster” on the set. Not a few wondered at the youthful director who pushed the actor regardless, it seemed, of his pitiful condition. Drugs were just one of the problems besetting the Blues Brothers film. Another was the unwieldly, almost unmanageable, sprawling 300- page script by Dan Aykroyd, the wooden Canadian who played Belushi’s straight man. With scissors and paste Landis shaved the script down to a hollow story that relied almost exclusively on explosions, stunts and helicopter maneuvers to replace Aykroyd’s jumble. The special effects and stunts took on even greater importance when it became clear that Belushi’s charismatic humor style was lost to drugs. With Blues Brothers, Landis established high-risk stunts and colossal special effects as his cinematic trademark. He had discovered that with stunts you didn’t need a story, or even an actor, as the dysfunctional Belushi in Blues Brothers had shown. After the filming the director would speak of Blues Brothers in terms of a comedy epic, the biggest stunt movie of all time, “bigger than The stunt coordinator on the film was Hollywood veteran stuntman Gary McLarty. He had once been unconscious for eight days after a jeep accident on a TV series. McLarty had coordinated hazardous stunts for Landis before while others took the credit. Of the well-known last scene in Animal House, for instance, where Belushi as Bluto swings down Tarzan-style on a rope, Belushi used to boast that he performed this hazardous exploit himself, while in reality McLarty had hired a local athlete who, “suited up” as Belushi’s double, performed the stunt without any recognition.

For Blues Brothers McLarty was told to employ “the most spectacular stunts ever.” McLarty saw the job as the highlight of his life. He supervised a mammoth stunt crew of 75 daredevils whose inner core of eight of the most fearless was a kind of commando-like unit on the set. With the director’s blessing they called themselves the Hollywood War Babies. In many of the film’s car chases McLarty drove the bullet car with a camera mounted into a point-of-view (POV) position at speeds in excess of 100 mph . As McLarty drove as fast as he could under Chicago’s famed downtown L with the cameras rolling, his fellow stuntmen crossed perilously close in front of him. One of the cameramen noted to his consternation that Landis pushed the stunt people to go “faster and faster, closer and closer.” Because of the disorganization, the Blues Brothers shooting was plagued by pitfalls that more often than not made the set a dangerous and unsafe place. During one of the Chicago explosion scenes in which an authentic old gas station was to be blown to bits, Cliff Wenger, a highly-experienced special effects technician, seeing that the explosion might involve an overhead power line, stopped the action – even though it infuriated the young director. In the famous chase scene filmed in the abandoned Dixon Mall in Harvey, Illinois, Landis had the art department restore the mall that had been closed for ten years; real plate glass instead of the safer special effects “candy glass” was put in store windows for the cars to shatter as they zoomed into the shops. But it wasn’t merely the super-real visuals of sharp flying shards, during which one stunt girl received a slight cut; in an interview just weeks before the fatal Twilight Zone crash, the director recalled with satisfaction the ghastly end to which they subjected the old Dixon shopping mall, boasting that it was “all (sic) real glass, ‘cause it’s cheaper.” Shirley Levine, the director’s mother, appeared in Blues Brothers as a bag lady. Her son appeared in the scene where Elwood and Jake are chased into the mall by state troopers.

All the elements of disaster on the TZ movie were present during the shooting of Blues Brothers. But nothing foreshadowed more hauntingly the scenario at Indian Dunes than the young director’s dealings with the helicopter shots on that film. Blues Brothers had many roles assigned to a helicopter. It was crucial to several complex and inherently dangerous stunts. In one scene Landis wanted to drop the Bluesmobile from a helicopter at an altitude of 1,000 feet. For feats of this nature the Landis people needed the best in the business and the first expert they called upon was Jim Gavin, a former military pilot known as tops in his field. Since he was already committed to another job at the time Gavin suggested one of his colleagues, Ross Reynolds, who, in addition to working as a helicopter stunt pilot for the movie industry, was also the chief pilot for the LA Fire Department. The prospect of the assignment at first intrigued Reynolds. He contacted the Landis people and over the telephone was told of the intent to drop the Bluesmobile from the helicopter. Reynolds soon gave up trying over the phone to describe the different ways it could be done and instead decided to bend the rules a little and allow the movie people entry into the electrically fenced-in security hangar where the fire department’s helicopters were housed, so they could see what they were dealing with. What followed after he let Landis and his people into the facility was a four-hour harangue by the director in which Reynolds heard his ideas described as “dumb” and his suggestions repeatedly dismissed with “won’t fit the script.” Reynolds afterwards called the Landis people back and politely excused himself, saying he had a scheduling conflict. He suggested, however, another pilot, Carl Wickman. Wickman was younger than Reynolds and better able to deal with the young director’s “highly opinionated” style. Once in Chicago, Wickman became the overall stunt coordinator for the film’s aerial shots, in particular the Bluesmobile’s spectacular drop from the sky. Wickman’s initial job was to clear everything with the FAA. At first Landis wanted to film the opening of the scene with the helicopter carrying the Nazimobile occupied by Laugh-In stalwart Henry Gibson, while the two actors dressed in Nazi uniforms were actually inside.

At first Landis wanted to film the opening of the scene with the helicopter carrying the Nazimobile occupied by Laugh-In stalwart Henry Gibson, while the two actors dressed in Nazi uniforms were actually inside. The original plan called for beginning the car-dropping scene by flying them over the city while cameras mounted to the car filmed them in flight with Chicago below as a backdrop. After Wickman priced out the cost of doing this shot safely ($500, 000) just for bringing in the special helicopter equipment, these ambitious plans were soon scrapped. Landis decided to film it the conventional way by taking a background film of the Chicago buildings from the air and projecting the images behind the actors safely seated in a mocked-up car inside a studio. It seemed to Wickman that Landis couldn’t understand why he, as a pilot, wouldn’t do certain things for the sake of the shot. Following the car-dropping stunt, the helicopter’s next appearance was even trickier. It occurred in the movie’s big finale when National Guard troops invade downtown Chicago’s Daly Plaza and there’s a closeup shot of the helicopter hovering above them at a height of between 10 and 15 feet; the height referred to in helicopter-talk as “dead man’s curve” because, should the engine lose power, it’s a straight fall down. On the set in Daly Plaza that day was Jim Ventrella, one of the FAA officials assigned to oversee the Blues Brothers filming as it related to helicopter safety. It was his first movie set and he had occasion to observe his first Hollywood director. He found a shaggy young man who impressed him as “always moving, almost hyper.” Ventrella told Landis and Wickman that the stunt planned for the plaza wouldn’t be safe because, he explained, in such a low hover “if the helicopter lost power the public and extras could be hurt by the landing.” Landis would have to film the shot, Ventrella insisted, with the helicopter flying in behind the people. The director appeared to understand Ventrella’s warning about the low-hovering craft and, with the FAA official looking on, the shot was promptly rearranged. A few years later, when Ventrella first heard of the Twilight Zone crash, one of the things that came back to his mind was the Hollywood director’s apparent indifference to certain realities – how he “was just looking for the best possible shot.” After Blues Brothers fell flat some of the aura of Animal House was rubbed away and Blues Brothers was being billed in the business as “1942,” in wry reference to Spielberg’s flop with 1941.

With 1941 and ^(ω)1942^(′′) in quick succession, Universal decided that it couldn’t afford to do comedies with these directors any longer, and as a result, Sean Daniel couldn’t sell the studio on Landis’ next idea, a monster movie remake called An American Werewolf in London. The studio passed on it; Polygram, a smaller independent film company, ended up financing it. Landis decided to do the American Werewolf after his old friend Rick Baker had been contacted by another new young film maker, Joe Dante, to do the werewolf masks in The Howling. Dante was being groomed as a Spielberg protege; the lore of the business had it that Dante’s early Roger Corman movie, Piranha, so impressed Spielberg as the “best Jaws ripoff ’ that instead of suing he hired Dante. Fifteen years before in the setting of Kelly’s Heroes Landis had written his own script called An American Werewolf in London, and by letting Baker work with Dante he felt that he ran the risk of jeopardizing his own longtime goal of doing a werewolf remake. In the deal with Polygram, Landis ended up making the film for a reasonable $8 million. But American Werewolf, when it came out in the summer of ‘81, was neither the financial disaster of Blues Brothers nor a financial success, though it made Rick Baker famous, winning him an Academy Award for his werewolf transformation effects. The film drew crowds but not the big crowds Polygram had hoped for. A stagnant reputation is fatal in Hollywood and after American Werewolf Landis’ reputation failed to rise with any new projects or announcements of new offers. Landis hired a publicist, Warren Cowan, to improve his standing in Hollywood. In short order, an LA Herald Examiner article appeared calling John Landis the “definitive baby mogul.” The baby mogul boasted to one reporter, “People are falling all over themselves to give me money,” and complained, “In Europe I’m lionized, in America the press considers me a war criminal.” He portrayed himself with already inflated self–importance as a victim of the press because he was John Landis, even suggesting that Spielberg’s 1941 got dumped on because “with Landis in the movie, you get bad reviews.” While Folsey was flying back from London in August ^(𝔠)81 for the Chicago preview of American Werewolf, he read for the first time a script called Into the Night.

Landis liked it, but during pre-production attempts in the last months of 1981, Keith Barish, the financier, fell through; there was no other financial backing and Into the Night was shelved for a new project that involved the team into the early part of ^(′)₈₂ . It was a comedy chase story called Whereabouts and Landis was trying to get Warren Beatty for it. Apart from Whereabouts, Landis told people he was busy on numerous other projects. He let it be known that he also had a version of Dick Tracy, again with Warren Beatty as a prospective star. But in reality his file of ideas was dwindling like a rummage sale – Topanga West, Say Uncle, Monkey King, Troop; and when John Belushi died in March of ‘82 Landis was working with Aykroyd on The Blues Brothers Meet the Zombie Queen, a throwback to their recent failure, this time set in New Orleans with the KKK and Ton Ton Macoute as villains. At this point the telephone call from Steven Spielberg inviting him to do the Twilight Zone film together could not have come at a better time. Spielberg revived the young director’s stagnant reputation, it was said, to make up for the bad blood between them since Deborah’s troubles on Raiders and Rick Baker’s lockout from the werewolf lab. In this act of reconciliation, if that’s what it was, Spielberg made a very generous gesture as acknowledged in the “deal memo,” movie-ese for a contract, in which Spielberg tactfully seemed to recognize John Landis’ known aversion to studio control. After making Blues Brothers Landis had complained, “I have to take Universal’s Teamsters, I have to take their electricians, I have to go by the rules.” It had been structured differently, he claimed, on Werewolf, where he and George Folsey signed the payroll checks, “And it was a pleasure.” The deal memo with his new partner in the TZ movie not only promised Landis freedom from the rules but he was also given final cut, a privilege shared by neither George Miller nor Joe Dante, the other two directors. The four film makers involved each received $1 million on a “negative pickup” basis, where the studio provides the money in return for the finished film. The deal allowed John Landis to operate as an independent and Fly By Night, his original name for the production company, reflected an early stage of his relationship with Warner.

The deal allowed John Landis to operate as an independent and Fly By Night, his original name for the production company, reflected an early stage of his relationship with Warner. The legal entity in the deal representing John Landis was Levitsky Productions, Inc., a “loan-out” company; that is, it lent out the services of John Landis and received compensation accordingly, while another entity, Twilight Zone Productions, an umbrella organization covering both Fly By Night and Levitsky Productions, was simply a payment channel through which Warner funded the Spielberg-Landis co- production. However, as the deal developed and Warner in the end rejected the “negative pickup” arrangement, Twilight Zone Productions eventually usurped all of the Landis organs involved in producing his segment, so that the Landis people continued to use the name Fly By Night only as a joke privy to the initiated. The deal memo called for Landis to “write and direct the prologue, epilogue, and one segment of the picture.” In exchange for these services, Levitsky Productions would receive $150, 000− S30, 000 for writing, $30, 000 for producing, $90, 000 for directing. Included in the deal was a 50-50 split between the two co-producers. Landis’ participation thus amounted to a very generous half of ten per cent of the gross receipts of the picture escalating to 121/2 per cent of the gross receipts in excess of cash break even not earlier than $15, 000, 000 of gross receipts, and then to 15% of the gross receipts in excess of initial break-even plus 50% of 100% of the net profit… Frank Marshall, Spielberg’s friend and partner, and the film’s executive producer, in addition to a flat $100, 000 fee, would get one- half of 1% of the gross after cash break even, and 3% net profit. Writer Richard Matheson and director George Miller would also get a tiny part of the net profit, apart from their fees for writing and directing, respectively, while Joe Dante received only his fees as a director. John Landis’ final cut on his segment was subject to one condition: that he deliver the film on schedule (within six weeks after completion of principal photography) and within the approved post-production budget. The pressure to bring in the film on budget was contained in the “contingency 10%^(″) clause of the agreement. At bottom it meant that if the director exceeded his $1 million budget by more than 10% the studio was legally entitled to take his final cut away; in other words, he could bring in his $1 million picture for $1.1 million, but no more.

However, in what could only be interpreted as another generous act by the maker of E.T., Spielberg permitted Landis to put ahead of everybody else’s segment a short Landis had written called “Real Scary.” In the film it appeared as the opening story, a kind of prologue before the credits in which the director got Dan Aykroyd to do him a favor and appear for a minimal $10, 000 . For John Landis the deal with Spielberg assumed a call to extraordinary endeavor. He wanted to make a picture that would prove his creative superiority to his co-producer and prove to Hollywood that he could do it at a lower cost. He stressed that he alone, being both writer and director, was auteur, pointing out that George Miller, Joe Dante and Steven Spielberg were all doing reinterpretations of old Twilight Zone stories. Miller’s segment was called “Nightmare at 20,000 Feet,” Joe Dante’s was a very personal version of “It’s a Good Life,” and Steven Spielberg’s segment was based on George Clayton Johnson’s old Twilight Zone episode, “Kick the Can.” Landis took pride in claiming for his script the unique and original attempt to “specifically do a very particular kind of Twilight Zone segment.” He distinguished it as “the only political or moral episode in the film,” and spoke freely of his ambition to out-Spielberg Spielberg. He showed frank delight in a contest in which he would dazzle with spectacular fireballs and stunts of an astonishing realism. By 6 a.m. of Friday, July 23,1982, the set at Indian Dunes had the stricken look after a disaster. In the dawn light a few people here and there stood quietly or talking in subdued tones. Deputy Sheriff Tom Budds, among the first to arrive on the scene, consulted with the local deputies and the coroner’s men he found already at the site. There were one or two studio truckdrivers and a scattering of the land company guards.

Deputy Sheriff Tom Budds, among the first to arrive on the scene, consulted with the local deputies and the coroner’s men he found already at the site. There were one or two studio truckdrivers and a scattering of the land company guards. One of the new arrivals was Adnon “Don” Llorente; an investigator with the National Transportation Safety Board, he was accompanied by an official from the Federal Aviation Administration. Their number was to swell in the succeeding hours as more investigators from different state and local agencies joined them. Some would still be poking over the grounds when evening fell. Middle-aged for the most part, unflamboyant, they made a very distinct contrast to the bearded young film makers who had preceded them on the set. Don Llorente received his first report from the sheriff ’s homicide man. Tom Budds filled him in on the details as far as he knew them and mentioned one unusual incident which had occurred in the hour preceding dawn. It involved a mysterious straggler doing something furtive on the bank opposite around the huts. When he shouted the figure, instead of coming forward, had just turned and fled. Don Llorente was short, sturdily built, mild-mannered, a good listener, and enigmatic like a priest. A pilot himself, he investigated air crash scenes, seeking amidst smoking rubble and twisted wreckage for clues to the causes that brought the aircraft down. The job required steel nerves. It was often macabre. Burned torsos fell on top of Llorente during one recent investigation. The deserted village set, next to the sluggish stream, hardly impressed the federal official as the location where a major Hollywood movie had been in progress only a few hours before his arrival. Missing were the motion picture cameras, the cannisters of film, the evidence of sound recording machines and sound tracks; even the giant Chapman crane which had held some cameramen high above the violent action was gone. The rapid departure of practically all of the film’s crew left behind only the scantest evidence that six cameras, two sound crews and nearly one hundred other film technicians had just recorded on film the ghastliest scene in the history of cinema. With the arrival of Llorente, Budds’ authority on the set was ended. The federal arm outreached the local, though Budds did not yield at once. The two men differed in the object of their investigation. Llorente focused on safety conditions at the time of the crash. Budds as a homicide man looked for foul play. The dispute quickly subsided when Llorente reminded Budds that he had the power to call in federal marshals and have him thrown off the set.

They agreed to collaborate and in the months to come Llorente kept his word. At crucial times when Tom Budds was bogged down, a hint from Llorente would turn him around and put him back on track, until five years later their work would culminate in a sensational Hollywood courtroom drama. The police understanding of what had brought on the Landis segment’s deadly finale was to be flawed and finally crippled due to a train of errors which Tom Budds, simply by being first on the scene, had the misfortune of setting in motion. Earlier that night in the course of his lone rounds over the abandoned set, he received a report which, in the light of later events, would turn out to have contained a startling development. A vehicle loaded with explosives was trying to get through Warner’s Burbank studio gate where guards, apparently terrified to let it onto the lot, had contacted the police with an urgent plea for instruction; in the dark desert dunes the request came over Budds’ radio telephone as to what they should do. It was not his department. He hung up and continued taking notes for his police report, having deprived the police of a priceless chance to inspect the 10-ton special effects truck before it was swept clean. By seizing the powder bombs, the police could have obtained an indication of the explosive force that gutted the movie set. The information would have been of immense consequence to its subsequent investigation. The condition of the special effects crew’s equipment and of the explosives would have helped dispel the early conviction which for a considerable time was shared by Budds, Llorente and other investigators that the crash in the dunes was purely the result of an unavoidable accident. Indeed, the possibility that negligence of a criminal nature might have played a role would not occur to the authorities until long after the initial phase of the investigation was over. The escape of the SFX truck was unfortunately not to be the last of Budds’ sins in securing the evidence. Before Llorente’s arrival, while still the lone authority on the scene, Budds had sent one of the drivers down the Santa Clara with the order to break the dam in the hope of finding the missing shoulder and arm of ^(α)V#2, ” the second victim, for which paramedics had already dredged in vain.

The flimsy dam, hastily thrown up, was as quickly broken, and just as Budds had surmised when the waters fell back one of the deputy coroners found parts cut from Myca’s torso in shallows a few yards from the helicopter. The coroner came and fitted the shoulder and arm to the small headless trunk laid out on the furniture pad; a tag was tied to the ear of the seven-year-old’s head and Myca’s diminutive remains were briefly exposed for an identification picture before being covered again by the quilt. But by breaking the dam, Budds had inadvertently posed a threat to the integrity of the site. The broken rotor blades and mortars had already been moved. The draining Santa Clara washed away debris from the village. Slowly the accident scene was being altered and when Llorente appeared on the scene his first official act was to preserve what was left of the set. He ordered the draining of the river halted and had the arson man go out to check the site for explosives. By now it was past eight. More and more people showed on the set. For the investigators the most interesting of these were the eyewitnesses to the crash. They appeared on the set like ghosts from the “Twilight Zone,” some to wander in unannounced and unnoticed, others as if driven by an inner compulsion. The first to come to the investigators’ attention was a huge person with a potbelly and wild goatee in whom Tom Budds recognized the mysterious straggler who earlier had turned and fled when he tried to hail him. His name was Jerry Williams. Williams was shortly followed by the pilot, Dorcey Wingo. Williams described himself as an independent special effects man – ”No company name.” During the filming the night before he had spent most of his time close by the side of the man who was both his friend and the special effects supervisor on the show, Paul Stewart. Although unknown to the investigating deputy, only a few hours earlier Williams had been seen hustling important evidence onto the SFX trucks which exited the scene before the police arrived. But all he could tell Budds was that explosions went off, after which the helicopter went out of control. As to the mortars exploding around the helicopter, the plan was to “fire by observing action and firing when safe,” and apart from the obvious, the helicopter coming down and killing the actors, he had surprisingly little to say. Williams said he stayed on the", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634243667_cleaned.txt:47:763e24795736", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 1651, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634243667_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634243667", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634243667_cleaned", "chunk_index": 48, "text": "seen hustling important evidence onto the SFX trucks which exited the scene before the police arrived.

Williams said he stayed on the set a while, went home, and returned with the purpose of looking for explosives still buried in the ground. After Llorente requested Williams to help “disarm the village,” the potbellied powderman teamed up with the sheriff ’s arson man in examining the blasted huts. While leading the arson man through the village, Williams became the first of anyone directly involved in the crash to give an account of what had happened. He told how he and two other powdermen, Jim Camomile and Harry Stewart, were charged with setting up and detonating the special effects mortars during the filming. He himself, he indicated, controlled a total of six mortars; five mortars involved with huts on the east end of the set and one mortar in the water west of the bamboo pier with the sampan, the spot closest to where the helicopter was actually knocked down. Of his own six mortars, he acknowledged firing his first five furthest from the helicopter “in a random pattern”; the sixth, located in the water west of the bamboo pier, was not fired, as he felt the helicopter was “too close to the device.” Finishing up his conversation with Williams, the arson man was joined by the two graphic artists from the sheriff ’s department. At Budds’ direction one went out with his sketchpad to make a to-scale drawing of the location and cliff. The photographer spent much time clicking on a black metal square pot inside the “drying hut,” one of the most severely damaged structures of the eleven different hutches which the art department had built for the final sequence. The square-shaped mortar in that hut had cooked up a fireball that blasted through the drying hut’s bamboo floor and thatched roof, engulfing the helicopter. Another object to draw the lensman’s curious attention was the rear rotor blade covered with soot that had detached from the helicopter and like the broken part of a toy was lying on the ground. While all this activity was afoot, the pilot appeared. Tom Budds first spotted Dorcey Wingo on the bank opposite the cliff just after he and Llorente finished interrogating Jerry Williams. Wingo identified himself by his striking flying man’s name and stated his connection with the crashed 87701 Bell UH-1B.

Wingo said he had been taken to the hospital in Valencia and was treated for minor bruises and released. The pilot was still wearing his Vietnam combat fatigues under a bomber jacket and baseball cap. He was agitated and eager, as if a compulsion to talk had driven him back to the dunes. He offered no objection to Llorente’s suggestion that their conversation be taped. Sheriff Budds also wanted a copy of Wingo’s statement, so he went back to his car and returned with his own tape recorder. Dorcey Wingo talked into the two machines, peppering in names and movie jargon that would only become significant later. It was apparent that he felt compelled to exonerate his own part and, to a lesser extent, that of Landis and others. In the air, Wingo said, he’d been following orders from Dan Allingham, an occupant in the left front seat next to him with the job of directing the searchlight on the actors below. The pilot explained that he had to come down low and shine the light on the actors, chasing them and staying on top of them as they simulated escape from the chopper’s ominous flight. The movie script called for the pilot to fly at the escapees while the village exploded. Wingo said that he maintained a 35-40 ft. hover. He stabilized the craft at that altitude when he heard the order. He confessed, “And I did,” continuing, “And, uh, of course I knew nothing about the locations of the explosives.” The first, second and third explosions went off without causing the pilot undue alarm. Then came what Wingo called a “real-humdinger,” the fourth, and as the explosions continued, the pilot described to the cop and the NTSB man the horrifying instant every pilot dreads – when the craft, refusing to respond to control, obeys the law of gravity. That fourth explosion, the “humdinger,” was a “large fireball,” after which, in Wingo’s laconic phrase, “things began to deteriorate rapidly.” The ship began to turn to the left, it was dark, there were more fireballs, but as best as he could remember it was a 360-degree spiral nose-down. In that panicked exit he remembered unbuckling and “diving,” and probably stepping on Dan Allingham who was trying to get out through the skylight. He remembered running in confusion until, already halfway to the shore, he heard the dry, hacking noise of the Huey’s bare spinning shaft that would grind down into sparks and eventually blow up the helicopter. Wingo replied that in talking about it", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634243667_cleaned.txt:49:02cd950e0ce5", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 1653, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634243667_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634243667", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634243667_cleaned", "chunk_index": 50, "text": "fireballs, but as best as he could remember it was a 360-degree spiral nose-down.

Wingo replied that in talking about it with Dan Allingham he had mentioned his concern about debris interfering with the tail rotor and that before the final shot he, Wingo, went out to make sure that everything was well tied down. He pulled and tugged on the cardboard and straw material on the huts and discovered, Wingo concluded, that everything was nailed or stapled down. Just a few hours separated the speaker from the fatal blasts he was describing, and, like a movie track, the memories of the chaotic aftermath overlaid with grisly sounds and images the quiet setting to which he had returned. They took the speaker back to the unearthly wail in the night, making again vivid that moment when looking across the river he saw dimly through the trees behind the Chapman crane the figure of the little girl’s mother – ”like somebody just lost their marbles” – being restrained by some other dim figure. Over this same placid shoreline on which the pilot stood facing his interrogators in the bright light of a new day, Steve Lydecker, the master-camera shot, had come loping in the darkness to address consoling words.”Don’t worry, Dorce. I got it all on film. Don’t worry about a thing,” just before Wingo made his bewildered way to the ambulance that was to take him to the hospital. But in his account to Budds and Llorente the pilot made no mention of these instances that were still fresh in his mind. He confined himself to technical details. Cautious, circumspect, he didn’t say anything about the surprise water blasts in the rage scene blinding him to the point where it nearly caused him to collide with the cliff, and he passed over the incident afterwards that had seen him bow to Allingham’s request not to attend a critical production meeting; nor when, motioning to the empty beer cans scattered around the flank of the broken-down helicopter, Budds asked whether any special effects people had been drinking, did the pilot reveal anything about his numerous encounters with alcohol on the set. Wingo merely replied that he had seen only one beer can, suggesting that what Budds saw might have been left by bikers who used the park; he and his crew and anyone working around them, he insisted, only had soft drinks.

The pilot was similarly mild in his description of the manic character who, with his vituperative crew-bashing, would soon come to be regarded as the chief cause of the disaster. “We have the normal domineering genius aspect in the director,” Wingo told Budds in reply to the officer’s question concerning any personality conflicts on the set. “That is not uncommon at all,” he indicated, “the man who pushes for what he wants, not uncommon in any movie-making process like this, but a man who would touch you and talk to you and console you. And I feel,” he added, “that I had confidence in his ability to produce this film safely.” Wingo’s evasiveness in his initial encounter with investigators had the probably unintended effect of putting him among the early makers of the cover-up. The speaker in the combat jacket and baseball cap kept his innermost feelings in a box with a tight lid. Only the coming months and years would expose the contents of that box as through subsequent interviews and confessions Wingo gradually lifted the lid. And when, six months hence in January 1983, investigators were to get their first glimpse of the contents it would enable them to look back and appreciate the pilot’s dilemma during that first talk they had with him in Indian Dunes. For Wingo at the time had felt terribly isolated and alone. Over the years this feeling of abandonment would lead him to pry steadily at the lid of the box, revealing more of his true feelings with each retelling of the story. Between the time he crashed and his reappearance at the site some six hours later the pilot had seen very little of the people on the set whose assurances of “safety first” had persuaded him to fly in the final scene. After his arrival at the hospital Wingo had no contact with Landis and Allingham, and the pilot learned only after talking to one of his own crewmen, a fuel truck driver who had followed him to the Henry Mayo Hospital, that Landis was not among the injured; the driver told Wingo that he saw the director weeping while talking on one of the hospital pay phones to “someone important.” The sense of abandonment, already apparent while Wingo delivered his cautious account to the investigators’ tape recorders, would deepen and turn into frustration and anger in the succeeding days. That very weekend, the pilot tried to call Dan Allingham. It was only to say something innocuous like, “Don’t you", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634243667_cleaned.txt:51:d40a0d9840b1", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 1655, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634243667_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634243667", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634243667_cleaned", "chunk_index": 52, "text": "Mayo Hospital, that Landis was not among the injured; the driver told Wingo that he saw the director weeping while talking on one of the hospital pay phones to “someone important.” The sense of abandonment, already apparent while Wingo delivered his cautious account to the investigators’ tape recorders, would deepen and turn into frustration and anger in the succeeding days. That very weekend, the pilot tried to call Dan Allingham. It was only to say something innocuous like, “Don’t you feel good to be alive?” Allingham’s girlfriend answered the phone and promised that Dan would return the call – but Dan never did. News of the tragedy out at Indian Dunes had an immediate and profound impact on the studio which, as the film’s financier, could be held ultimately accountable. In the succeeding months and years Warner Bros. would be preoccupied with the legal ramifications. In the process the studio would become intimately acquainted with the names of Tom Budds and Don Llorente. But mere hours after the crash the most imminent danger to the studio came from a small-time state bureaucrat who had already let it be known that the labor commissioner’s office had no record of a permit that allowed Myca and Renee to work on a movie set. Among the representatives of the half-dozen federal, state and local agencies which swarmed the Twilight Zone set by mid-morning was the labor commissioner’s man, Charlie Hughes. Charlie’s slight, rumpled, ineffectual appearance masked his power as a child employment investigator, whose findings would have the most immediate impact on Warner Studios in Burbank. Charlie Hughes’ office, upon determination of a certain set of facts, had the power to revoke Warner’s state-controlled labor license to use kids in motion pictures and television. The big Burbank studio leased the site at Indian Dunes from the Newhall Land & Farming Company. Weldon Sipes, the land company’s manager at Indian Dunes, was himself a former film locations man. Not long after the helicopter crash, he appeared on the deserted set, acting, in effect, at that early hour as the studio representative. Sipes posted guards and kept an eye on the property until John Silvia, Warner’s own safety man arrived about 9 a.m. Silvia’s job at the Warner lot was to identify hazards on the set, such as heavy machines, explosives, dangerous animals and stunts. Typically, working from a script, Silvia marked the dangerous parts so that the special effects people or the assistant director might know the kind of animal or stunt the insurance people were likely to object to. Silvia had come out from Boston several years before with the dream of becoming a Hollywood writer, producer and director. Sneakered and bearded, he was in the current mode set by the new successful Hollywood producers and directors like Spielberg and Landis.

Sneakered and bearded, he was in the current mode set by the new successful Hollywood producers and directors like Spielberg and Landis. At mid-morning Silvia was relieved by Jim Miller, one of Warner’s top studio lawyers. A vice president in studio business affairs, Miller usually worked behind the scenes in Warner’s corporate complex. Learning of the accident as early as 3 a.m., he had called Warner’s VP of production, Ed Morey. At Indian Dunes, Miller issued the statement that Warner had no explanation for the alleged child labor violations and did not know who hired the children or how they got paid. By then, more studio people had arrived on the set. Dick Vane, who had been on the set all night and had helped shield the children from Jack Tice, the fireman/welfare worker, went around politely soliciting the investigators for their business cards. Meanwhile, Frank Marshall, Spielberg’s junior business partner and the film’s executive producer, was being quietly represented by a young man from the Spielberg organization named Dennis Jones; like Dick Vane, Jones had worked on Spielberg’s E.T. and Poltergeist. Each faction within the studio compact appeared to have his representative in the dunes and John Landis had Saul Kahan from the early circle of young cutups bitten by the movie bug. Short, grown pudgy, balding, still in rumpled college clothes, Kahan never had the acting career he aspired to, nor anything like the success of his friend from Kelly’s Heroes. Like Silvia, he had settled on Hollywood’s fringes. He worked under Rob Friedman, Warner’s chief publicist at the Burbank studio. Kahan spent much of the early morning of the disaster on the telephone. Alpha Campbell, John Landis’ personal secretary, was the subject of an early call he placed to Friedman, urging that she be kept quiet over at Universal Studios. Minutes later Kahan personally called Alpha. She was expeditiously told to get hold of the black-and-white photographs taken at the crash site by the film’s still photographer, Morgan Renard. They were wanted by Frank Marshall. Some reporters, like the wire service boys who never sleep, had been waiting at Indian Dunes to be admitted to the set since shortly after the report of the crash came over the police radio band. Blocked at the Cyclone gate by the old man in the trailer, their early outpost had grown to a media mob.

As well, a historic precedent gave a sensationalist twist to the story: normally actors didn’t die on Hollywood sets because stunt people took the fall. Stunt people sometimes died. Special effects people were sometimes blown up by their own devices. It went with the profession. It went on in the industry. But now for the first time in Hollywood history a Hollywood actor had been killed on a Hollywood movie set. The newsmen gathered at Indian Dunes would not learn the most salient facts until considerably later. For hours they were kept at the confines of the set. Studio guards brought in by John Silvia kept most of the milling crowd at bay. Location manager Dick Vane personally inspected the places where he thought news people might try and crash the scene in order to take pictures, and when one TV crew actually jumped the fence and got close to the crash site, Vane and his men radioed other security people: “Stop the trespassers.” As the morning wore on two news helicopters raised a clamor in the sky. In the scrub stood a glittering caravan bristling with antennae, news vans and jeeps dusty from beating up the dunes. The throng, tired of lounging in the dust and heat, felt relieved when the long-awaited publicist arrived at noon. But hopes of seeing the set were dashed for the time. It was past two o’clock that Friday afternoon when Landis’ close personal friend finally permitted the gate to be unbarred. Kahan led the news corps to the gutted scene dominated by the large green crippled hulk of the helicopter. Someone from the studio had come earlier and erased the legend from the helicopter nose cone. Where the FLY BY NIGHT legend had been boldly painted, someone had scrubbed the water-soluble paint away, leaving only an empty space. The eagle was still there, as if dug in the cone by its talons, but the words had vanished, never to be heard from again, never to be mentioned in all the years of testimony and trial, as if literally flown away by night.

The curious press crowd had no reason to suspect that the bare metal strip over the eagle was the erasure of a joke which apparently in someone’s mind had turned embarrassing. The erasure of the self-deprecating logo was one of the very first acts in a cover-up that persisted for 5 years. Among the movie trade papers and LA dailies it was the custom to send young cubs to fast-breaking Hollywood stories. Not yet grown cynical and slow like the old war horses, they were quick off the mark and enthusiastic. At Indian Dunes the youngest reporter was Andy Furillo whose name had a certain ring in Los Angeles in connection with his father Bud Furillo, a well-known sports columnist, and his uncle, Carl Furillo, who played for the Brooklyn and LA Dodgers. Andy was starting his journalistic career at the Los Angeles Herald Examiner. On account of his flaming red thatch he was to become known during the protracted TZ trial as the “carrot-top cub” (to which he would invariably respond, “a carrot top is green not red”). The TZ disaster was Furillo’s first big Hollywood story and when Kahan admitted him to the set he had not the least idea that the story would involve him for the next five years. The most interesting knowledge Furillo obtained on the set was the name of Steven Spielberg whom Kahan mentioned while describing the format of the film. Furillo’s interest was understandable in light of the fact that in the summer of 1982, due to the almost simultaneous release of two Spielberg movies, E.T. and Poltergeist, everybody knew the name of the young director who looked like an optometrist in a suburban shopping mall while turning out movies that made more money than any in Hollywood history. Variety ran a “Spielbergmania” headline three days before the deaths on the TZ set. In terms of news value, the name John Landis meant less than that of the new king of Hollywood. Andy was eager to follow up the Spielberg angle when he got back to the office. But back downtown the cub quickly reconciled himself to the realization that getting hold of Steven Spielberg would probably require an executive order from the White House. He learned from Warner publicist Friedman that John Landis, after being taken to the Henry Mayo Hospital in Valencia, had left for an unknown destination.

After a few more fruitless calls to the studios Andy wrote the story. The story in the next day’s Herald edition identified the accident as having occurred during the filming of a new “Steven Spielberg film.” The other dailies, too, for about a week continued to identify the crash as having occurred on a segment directed by John Landis for a “Steven Spielberg film.” But something curious happened without anyone, not even Andy Furillo, being aware of it at the time. They stopped calling the movie “a Steven Spielberg film.” And as Steven Spielberg suddenly ceased being associated with the film and the fatal crash, his co-producer became more prominently identified. The new “Steven Spielberg film” was now linked exclusively with John Landis. Donna Schuman was married to Dr. Harold (Hal) Schuman, apsychiatrist employed by LA County. At one time Donna was an everybody in Hollywood she waited for the big break. In the meantime, she drifted into TV production. She had no movie experience apart from one film she worked on, on which George Folsey, Jr. was editor. She was bright, efficient, a hard worker; she called herself “Flash” – and with these qualifications in mind, rather than her film experience, George Folsey Jr. called her up in the spring of 1982 to ask her to work on the TZ movie. Donna had worked for John Landis previously in a film which never got beyond the pre-production stages. Folsey promised that the new movie would be short and simple and that because John didn’t want to spend money on offices or on a move to Warner the picture would be done out of a bungalow on the Universal lot, Building 71; a single-story structure that looked more like an army barracks than a Hollywood facility. It was going to be a little cramped, Folsey admitted. They were not going to hire a production coordinator or 1st AD, either. The director felt that she and Dan Allingham could handle things if she worked closely with him and was given plenty of backup people. In film where everything seems to have the word “production” before it – production reports, production schedule, production charts – Donna Schuman hired on as production coordinator on a salary at less than the union rate. On arrival at the Universal bungalow on her first day of work she entered a jerry-built maze of tiny hallways connecting some four or five offices.

On arrival at the Universal bungalow on her first day of work she entered a jerry-built maze of tiny hallways connecting some four or five offices. There were Schlock! and Werewolf posters everywhere on the walls. But soon she got the feeling of being in the wrong office. When George Folsey arrived she pointedly mentioned that things were not quite as she had expected. Folsey had a soothing rejoinder. The lines of communication had broken down. He promised to take care of it. The subsequent weeks brought no improvement. The chaos increased as everything was being compressed into a very tight schedule. The senior staff members coordinated most of the administrative, logistical, technical and operational needs of the Landis segment. The bungalow was headquarters for the daily shooting schedule, graphics and all photography needs, for set design and construction, scheduling, location decisions and contracting use of aircraft and pyrotechnics, as well as for dealings with civil authorities. The office was always crawling with people. Donna worked with Dan Allingham. Sometimes seventeen people, including herself, were waiting in the tiny hallway outside Allingham’s office. She worked in Allingham’s office for approximately one week until the 2nd AD, Anderson House and Hilary Leach, the DGA trainee, arrived. Under conditions in this office which Donna described as ranging “from silly to quite serious” she had to vacate her office and let Andy and Hilary have that space. Folsey helped her search for an appropriate place to work and at last offered his own desk and chair; he completed his work off the end of his desk. But about the pandemonium Folsey could do very little. Donna complained to him daily about the incredible disorganization in the office. Invariably, she was told that he would talk to the director about it. But nothing changed for the good reason that much of the chaos, the jarring tone, an atmosphere often close to hysteria that sent little waves of frenzy beating through the Universal bungalow, emanated from the director’s personality. Donna watched in amazement as Landis tore around the office like a hyperactive adolescent, awkward, loud, boisterous, with a piercing falsetto. One of his favorite “schticks” was a loping gait a la Groucho Marx, yelling something buffoonish, with hands held high. John Landis, Donna discovered, was a tireless joker, and as her husband noted, his jokes usually had some anti-ethnic orientation. The universal confusion that reigned in the bungalow was due to the director’s striving to cut costs all along the line, the result of the way Warner had structured the film budget.

The universal confusion that reigned in the bungalow was due to the director’s striving to cut costs all along the line, the result of the way Warner had structured the film budget. Andy House was shocked when he saw the state of the office. He told Donna he found it hard to believe that at the stage of production he had been brought in, still no shooting schedule had been prepared. As a day-to-day description of the sets, scenes, props, special effects, makeup and cast requirements, the shooting schedule is the blueprint for the filming action. And at an unusually late point in the production it fell to Andy House, with the assistance of DGA apprentice Hilary Leach, to prepare this vital document. It was with patch up, stopgap and even illicit measures that people in the bungalow tried to cope with mounting confusion. But everything was already too late once the production got rolling within its tight 12- day schedule. Even George Folsey, realizing that it was “just too much” for Dan, in the end was forced by Warner’s administrators to hire the 1st AD that they had hoped to do without. He was Elie Cohn, an Israeli film maker who had met John Landis before. More gofers were hired. But at that point Landis was so far into the production that the chaos increased proportionately. Every day packages containing call sheets, which tell what the production is doing from day to day, were spread across Folsey’s couch for lack of any other place to put them. The film’s SFX explosives were a sensitive issue around the office. In the final days of shooting, it was on everybody’s mind. Even Dan Allingham complained to his production coordinator that the director was spending a lot of money on explosives. Donna Schuman got the feeling that Landis wanted to do “something bigger and better than Spielberg.” Someone close to the director even told her that Landis was “a madman around Spielberg.” Everyone in the office knew about the illegal hiring of the kids. And when there was talk in the bungalow of stunts and explosives a kind of silence fell, because everyone in the office was involved in the dirty little secret. The person most deeply affected was Donna Schuman. It was common knowledge in the business that you couldn’t work kids under 18 at night. But she was pulling for the team, caught up in the spirit which Landis with his frenzy sparked about him, of pushing yourself and going beyond the call. About an hour later the phone rang again.

A slurry voice, thick with sedative, announced itself as Cindy Nigh, Allingham’s girlfriend and Folsey’s production assistant with whom Donna was friendly. Cindy was on Valium. Her voice sounded slow and fragmented. She talked about her fear earlier on the set when the explosion hit. It was so big that even though she had been standing on a hill with some other people far away the explosion headed toward them and she ran for her life. Vic Morrow reminded Alpha Campbell of the Hollywood she had known – and which was past and gone. In the new Hollywood, Alpha found that few people thought of a secretary as a human being. John Landis, when meeting famous stars in the office, would omit introducing her. But when Vic Morrow introduced himself his handshake was strong and real. He was polite and respectful and when Alpha was kind to Trudy, his young model girlfriend from Britain, he called back twice to thank her. Alpha thought Trudy was good for the middle-aged actor who was coming out of some very bad years. In a letter Alpha wrote Trudy a few months after Vic’s death she called Vic a “real Mensch,” and as Trudy in England might not know Hollywood-Yiddish argot Alpha wrote in brackets, (“human being”). Alpha Campbell had spoken to Vic Morrow on the night of his death and upon learning the shocking news she could only think, “If only he had called in sick.” For Vic a few hours before the final scene had called her up to complain about a tooth problem, grousing that the pain was unendurable. Feeling sorry for Vic when she heard him accuse his tooth in that gruff, gritty way of Sgt. Chip Saunders, she had even suggested, “Can’t you just stay home and take care of yourself?” Apparently, Alpha assumed, Dan Allingham got the pain killer to him, for at 2:20 a.m. Vic took his place under the helicopter with a child under each arm as the scene called for. Alpha Campbell was already in the office when Donna Schuman reported for work at the bungalow that Friday morning at 9:00 a.m. Both had a cry.

It had begun the moment she arrived and sat down at her desk. David Sargent called from NBC News. Then John Landis called. One of her very earliest callers was Lucy Fisher, the young president of Warner’s creative division who was also one of Hollywood’s rising female powers. Lucy Fisher spoke to Alpha from New York and called again a few hours later to say that she was flying home that night. A lot of the calls were from media – People magazine, Entertainment Tonight, the Herald Examiner, Hollywood Reporter; NBC News called again. Alpha fielded questions from Landis’ father and stepfather and his mother-in-law, Mrs. Nadoolman. Carole Serling, the widow of Twilight Zone creator Rod Serling, called. Sesame Street’s cookie monster, the creator and director of Miss Piggy movies, Frank Oz, called from Hawaii; Bemie Brillstein, Dan Aykroyd’s agent, called from Century City, and Jamie Lee Curtis called from her apartment in West LA: “I love him very much and I am behind him. If he needs something, please call.” Steven Bishop, the musician, and John Candy, the comic actor from SCTV, called; young Hollywood kept Alpha’s switchboard lit. Her last message of the day was from Sean Daniel. Alpha kept in touch with Indian Dunes through Dennis Jones, Frank Marshall’s man, who reported on the police activity on the set. Meanwhile, Warner publicist Friedman asked Alpha to help Saul Kahan get a “bio” out of the trailer on the set. Frank Marshall personally called asking for a raft of things. Everybody wanted lists or sheets or copies of papers and documents. TZ movie’s financial backer, Warner was actually Landis’ employer; but the young director was indulged by the old guard that ran the studio system. The studios bent over backward to please the young film maker who seemed to read what kind of movies people liked, and when John Landis wanted to house his whole operation in a cramped bungalow on the Universal lot Warner assented, even though it effectively removed Landis from control and meant complications which at one point even included having two of Warner’s financial watchdogs work out of a trailer on the Universal lot. It also forced the first showdown between Landis and the studio following the crash, resulting in the intervention of Landis’ chief legal strategist and a suspension of the “freeze” order.

Just before Donna Schuman arrived in the office, Warner’s executive, Ed Morey, asked Alpha for copies of all the call sheets and shooting schedules for the entire week. A vice president and executive production manager, Morey worked under Fred Gallo, Warner’s production chief. Morey called at least six times in the next thirty minutes, each time more irate, and driving Alpha nearly mad. At last Donna stepped in and got hold of George Folsey, explaining the director’s “freeze” instruction. Folsey knew as well as Donna that Warner wanted the call sheets and shooting schedules to see if they called for children. They both knew that neither Morey nor Warner’s lawyer Jim Miller, nor anyone else, would find any trace of the kids in them. About a half hour later Folsey called back. He told Alpha to give Morey everything he wanted and to cooperate fully with Warner. The decision was made by John Landis’ personal attorney, Joel Behr, the junior partner in the Century City law firm of Silverberg, Leon, Rosen & Behr, whom Folsey consulted about Morey’s request. A rising Hollywood lawyer, Joel Behr was entrusted by his senior partners with the legal well-being of an important client. Behr was the first person John Landis called from the Henry Mayo Hospital and eventually Behr would devote himself fulltime to the Landis case. When the legal problems of the director would require a half-dozen lawyers to fight on every front, including one of the highest paid criminal lawyers in the country, Joel Behr remained in the background. As Landis’ closest counselor and confidant, he was the architect of the director’s legal phalanx and even of the shape of his public behavior. W hen George Folsey made his early morning call to Donna Schuman to acquaint her with the catastrophic outcome of the segment’s final shoot he used an outdoor telephone by the beat-up old trailer at the gate to the set area. A studio car was taking him and a small distraught party to the Henry Mayo Clinic in Valencia. Mrs. Chen, Renee’s mother, was already on her way to the hospital. Dr. Dinh Le, Myca’s father, was in Folsey’s car with John Landis. Dr. Le babbled disjointedly. With exquisite delicacy he expressed concern over how John Landis felt. He spoke of things he planned to do in the future. A small, frail man with almost dainty habits, he had the look both benign and remote which indicated a state of shock. He held John Landis by the hand.

He held John Landis by the hand. As Folsey spoke to Donna from the rustic telephone the police had not yet arrived. The scrub desert dunes lay silent under a wash of moonlight. George Folsey hung up and got back into the car where, in the back seat, Dr. Le still sat with his dainty hand in the grip of the traumatized Hollywood director. The driver of the car was a young, pretty Teamster driver employed by Warner who wanted to be an actress; on the set there’d been rumors about her relationship with the director. George Folsey was usually thought of as indecisive, content to coast, by not troubling the director. In part that was so because his partnership was not one of equals. Folsey, unlike Landis, had actually grown up in Hollywood, yet he looked up to his younger partner as a “genius,” a “voracious reader” with a tremendous knowledge of film that outstripped his own. But more concretely, as associate producer of the TZ segment, his relationship with the director was defined by the terms of the deal they received. Folsey’s earnings as associate producer were pegged to his partner’s, and according to their deal with Warner, George Folsey received only 10% of Landis’ portion of the profits. In the immediate crisis at Indian Dunes, however, with the director incapacitated, Folsey emerged as the main source of support. Dealing with Mrs. Chen, the mother of Renee, had required all of Folsey’s strength. “She was crazed,” Folsey remembered. Everybody on the set, as high up as the 100-ft. cliff, heard the unforgettable wail of the mother who saw her daughter disappear beneath the plunging helicopter, the wail reaching an unbearable pitch when next she saw Renee on the furniture pad with blood streaming from her nose and the frail bones glistening through the skin. The reassuring thin-voiced producer who had just told the mother that the explosives were merely Hollywood special effects was now himself tottering over the sobbing figure who hopelessly attempted to bring back life in the girl’s limp body. As Mrs. Chen had a panic attack she kicked and struggled while Folsey tried to hold her up. Afterwards, Folsey turned to Dr. Le who stood quietly gazing up at John Landis next to him. Dorcey Wingo had been on the set only two days and it was in the hospital that for the first time he saw George Folsey.

Dorcey Wingo had been on the set only two days and it was in the hospital that for the first time he saw George Folsey. The pilot walked around the lobby in confusion. The two E-cameramen, Robinson and Smith, were still dazed. John Landis was hysterical with grief. Craig Wooten, the fuel truck driver for the helicopter, standing next to the director while both were making telephone calls, heard Landis bawl into the phone while describing the story to what Craig Wooten took to be either a close friend or lawyer. The rapid series of telephone calls going in and out of the hospital at this hour was responsible for a lot of the commotion. Handed down from a bewildered nursing staff to any available movie person, the telephone calls became part of the confusion. The tangled messages created situations where it was possible for Howard Sanders, a production assistant, a mere gofer, to confer with Steven Spielberg’s personal attorney, Bruce Ramer, a most influential entertainment lawyer of the famous Gang & Tyre firm; the phone inexplicably ended up in Sanders’ hands. Ramer appeared informed of the disaster and warned Sanders about an Entertainment Tonight crew which he had heard was on its way to the hospital. By daybreak the movie people stayed one step ahead of the authorities by departing from the hospital. After apparently calling Steven Spielberg, Frank Marshall quietly vanished. Jackie Compton, Landis’ pretty Teamster driver who had waited faithfully in the hospital lobby, did not drive her employer home. In a car driven by another production assistant, Barry Penner, with Howard Sanders in the back, the distraught passenger in the front seat was taken to the Universal bungalow in Studio City. Folsey remained behind to deal with the children’s parents. Dr. Le at first was indisposed to call home where his wife waited up with their youngest son. He asked Folsey, who begged off. After ages searching through his address book Dr. Le finally rang a friend in the neighborhood. He asked that he tell Kim, Dr. Le’s wife, only that something terrible had happened. Folsey took a breather and left Myca’s father briefly in a room for a medical examination. But walking back to the lobby with the hospital chaplain, Folsey suddenly encountered Mark Chen who lunged out of a room.

Neither Folsey nor her husband could bring himself to tell her how Myca had died, and it was not until several weeks later, after stumbling on a strange word in a news story about the crash, that she found out by looking up in a dictionary the meaning of “decapitation.” Among the people and things on the set that melted away into the night were the film and soundtracks from the cameras used in the final scene. However, unlike other vanishings, the film could be traced, at least through its early hurried stages. It turned up in North Hollywood at the giant Technicolor labs at just about the time Folsey arrived on the doorstep of the Le’s in Cerritos. Two couriers handed the film in cans sealed with tape around the outside to the shipping clerk at the plant a little after 6 a.m. The clerk instantly rang upstairs to the plant foreman, Bill Galloway. Galloway had been expecting the film. Sometime earlier, just as the late shift was finishing up before going home, a call had come in from Warner. The plant was put on alert. Something really “hot” was coming in from the Twilight Zone movie. The shift was held over, and as soon as the film arrived Galloway took the can to Technicolor’s processing machine. There, the “negative-cutter,” Del New, became the first person to see the motion picture recording of the crash. One of Del New’s jobs was to check the quality of the negatives after being processed. But before the processed film could be viewed on a projector a print had to be made, the so-called “dailies,” where the print is rushed through the process without any augmentation from the film lab, giving the film makers a “rush,” or what the processors refer to technically as a “one light daily.” As soon as the first prints came out of the processing machine Del New locked himself in his viewing room. His immediate reaction to the rushes was relief that the scenes were not more graphic. New had been somewhat unnerved by the prospect of viewing a bloodbath but from the rushes he couldn’t really see the violence in any detail. Afterwards, at the specific request of Fred Talmadge, Warner’s chief of post-production, Del New personally hand-carried the prints from Technicolor over to Warner’s", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634243667_cleaned.txt:64:a4ec12efe878", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 1668, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634243667_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634243667", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634243667_cleaned", "chunk_index": 65, "text": "the first prints came out of the processing machine Del New locked himself in his viewing room.

Afterwards, at the specific request of Fred Talmadge, Warner’s chief of post-production, Del New personally hand-carried the prints from Technicolor over to Warner’s offices a few miles away. New arrived at Warner around 9:00 a.m. Talmadge was the first at Warner’s to see the film. After Talmadge, the film’s trail became obscured and investigators were never able to completely reconstruct its path. Only a few studio insiders directly involved in monitoring the film’s progress were aware that the studio’s top brass permitted the prints to be released to John Landis on the same day of the crash. Along the studio’s executive row the story circulated that Landis was in possession of the film prints during the entire morning and early afternoon of Friday, July 23, 1982, at which time the studio, perceiving a potential public relations disaster in the disclosure of its handling of key evidence, sent two members from its camera department to Landis to retrieve the film. George Folsey Jr. enjoyed only a few hours’ respite from the nightmare. He slept briefly and woke in the early afternoon of the same Friday, July 23. He got up, dressed, and drove to a large rambling house high up in Beverly Hills on 139 Lloyd Crest Drive. There, at the home of the director, he joined John Landis and the director’s personal lawyer Joel Behr who now represented them both. They discussed the meeting scheduled to begin in a few short hours when Warner executives and their lawyers would view the footage from Indian Dunes. It was decided that Folsey and Behr would attend the viewing. John Landis remained at home in what was officially described as a state of shock. The viewing was held in the complex known as TBS, The Burbank Studios, the studio lot and executive office complex owned jointly by Columbia and Warner Bros. Folsey and Behr met there in the early evening with Terry Semel, president of the Warner film division; Jim Miller, Warner’s top lawyer; and Spielberg’s man, Frank Marshall. In this same complex several weeks earlier Semel, Folsey, Marshall and Warner’s Lucy Fisher had met under more cheerful auspices, expecting to make a financially successful Spielberg movie on a relatively small $4 − 5 million) investment. The helicopter appeared to be nearly inside the fireballs about 30 feet over the exploding village. The two children, being carried northward across the river, were most of the way across when suddenly Vic stumbled and struggled to keep the little girl from going under in the water.

The two children, being carried northward across the river, were most of the way across when suddenly Vic stumbled and struggled to keep the little girl from going under in the water. The stumble prevented him from getting out of the way of the blades of the helicopter which quickly came down sideways with the main rotor spinning. The cuts showed the helicopter flipped over on its side; John Landis in his waders was seen flitting across the screen, the 1st AD in a white shirt splashed in the water – the cut was full of rushing action but somehow innocuous-looking. Of the six camera angles covering the fatal moment only the master shot, the B-camera, showed the blades that sliced into Vic Morrow and the two children. The viewers saw the action unroll without the benefit of one of the two soundtracks which had apparently gone missing. The blades seemed to do their work cleanly, as noted in the tone of relief by one of Landis’ lawyers. “From the standpoint of the potential to inflame a jury,” the lawyer was to write in summarizing the impact of the master shot, “it is fortunate that the details of the injuries inflicted on the three actors are not very easily observed in the film.” Among the small audience in the screening room Folsey and Marshall alone had seen the actual carnage. As they relived the frightful reality presented by the images, the only fear of criminal prosecution they could have had would have been the knowledge that children were on the set illegally without permits. But since there was no soundtrack with voices to help elucidate the mystery it was impossible to tell what had caused the crash and the meeting was short. After the lights came on it appeared that the studio executives had already seen the film before Behr and Folsey arrived. No one would have been more astonished than Don Llorente had he known this, as earlier on the same day he had been told by Warner that it had no knowledge of the film’s whereabouts. Llorente, then still at Indian Dunes – he did not leave until midnight – threatened to issue a subpoena George Folsey Jr. had known the actor who played Bill only for thefew weeks he spent with him on the shoot. But he knew his ex-wife, Barbara Turner, a Hollywood writer and actress. He also knew Barbara’s second husband, Reza Badiyi, a director for whom he had once worked.

Barbara and her two daughters by Vic, twenty-one-year- old Carrie Morrow and fifteen-year-old Jennifer Jason Leigh, were at Barbara Turner’s home when Folsey arrived in the afternoon on the day following Vic’s death, Saturday, July 24. He came with Belinda, his wife, to pay condolences. The actor’s funeral would be held the next day. After his initial surprise he sat down and wrote the tribute. He read it to Barbara, Carrie and Jennifer. After making a few changes Folsey called John Landis, presumably under doctor’s care at home. Landis, Folsey remembers, had him convey a request to “Barbara and the kids,” and Folsey turned to the mother and the two girls. I met Vic for the first time in my office one month ago. Having always admired his acting I was delighted to learn that Vic’s performances were the result of a keen intelligence and deep emotions. Vic was a professional, and his role as a lead in our story was brilliantly realized. There is no way to express my feelings at this overwhelming time. Just before the last take Vic took me aside to thank me for this opportunity. He knew how wonderful his performance was and wanted me to know how happy he was with the work. Tragedy strikes in an instant, but film is immortal. Perhaps we can take some solace in the knowledge that through his work in stage, television and film Vic lives forever. Vic Morrow’s funeral was not the first to involve the young film maker in a controversial Hollywood death. Less than five months before the Twilight Zone fatalities John Landis had attended John Belushi’s funeral. Hollywood had been shaken by the drug overdose death of the comedy sensation from Saturday Night Live. Belushi’s death put the spotlight on the personal habits of the new film personalities and at the time of Vic Morrow’s funeral Hollywood’s cocaine culture was under widely publicized scrutiny by the DA’s office. Assumptions were rife that drugs were involved in the crash on the movie set. A question mark still hung over the cause of the actor’s death. No one knew what had happened that night in Indian Dunes, except that it had been violent, gruesome, even grotesque. The service took place at Hillside Memorial Park Chapel in Culver City. The interval between the death and the burial, two days, satisfied the Jewish law according to which a body must be interred two days following its demise.

The service was simple, lasting a little over a half hour. Rabbi Morton Wallack spoke, then Folsey gave the eulogy, and John Landis spoke his eulogy next. The chapel was crowded with hundreds of mourners. Barbara Turner wore a black veil. With her daughters Carrie Morrow and Jennifer Jason Leigh she listened to the speech which she had heard Folsey recite in her living room the day before. Jennifer was said to have been estranged from her father; siding with her mother after the messy divorce, she was said to have vowed never to want to see her father again. Jennifer was pretty and looked like Vic. Aspiring to an acting career, she had already acted in a few small movie roles and had recently won accolades as a nude sensation in Fast Times at Ridgemont High. Her older sister would never be an actress; Carrie was plump and sweet and confused and after the divorce had tried to remain close to the stormy man who drank too much and was her father. A cross-section of the film industry stood in the hot sun around the plain brown wood casket: fellow actors and showbiz friends Ray Walston, Peter Lupus, Joyce Van Patten, Pat Harrington Jr. and Rick Jason who costarred with Morrow in Combat; Steve Shagan, the Oscar-winning screenwriter, and director Richard Donner; Morrow’s lawyer, Al Green, and lots of film people, including members of the TZ set, and, most prominently, the wild-eyed, longhaired, raven-bearded wunderkind with the glittering bifocals who, in his obsession with special effects, was looked upon by some mourners as the cause of the actor’s death. John Landis was accompanied by his wife. Six feet tall, gazelle-like, with strong Nefertiti features, she craned an immensely long neck over the crowd. As Deborah Nadoolman, with the costuming credit on her husband’s segment, she had outfitted Bill for what was to become his shroud-the blue polyester suit and the brown socks and the brown shoes in which he died. Landis’ presence at the funeral, especially as the unkempt eulogist in what seemed like a double bill with Folsey, struck the wrong note. Instead of solemnity there was near hysteria. The mourners listened in rising anger to two banal, feelingless speeches in which strangers to the dead man appropriated his memory.

The eulogists were not old friends of Vic’s like Steve Shagan, who had known him for some three decades. Vic’s friends at the funeral were offended to hear Folsey and Landis portray themselves as having personally suffered a loss, well aware that in terms of Hollywood reality the friendship the speakers had for the actor was contained in the “deal memo.” The director and his business partner were Morrow’s employers who had hired him because he fitted into the low-budget limits of the production. Morrow had taken the job because, as his attorney put it, “Vic was not turning down any work.” The fact that it was a production “spearheaded by Steven Spielberg,” according to Morrow’s agent, had a great appeal to the actor, for the $40, 000 salary was low by the standards of what Hollywood paid a leading man for 14 days – two days rehearsal and 12 days of filming. For a two-day appearance earlier in the Landis segment Albert Brooks received $5, 000 a day, on a per diem basis almost twice as much as Morrow was getting on a daily basis, and Morrow was the star! And so Vic Morrow, whose film career had consisted of a number of forgettable roles, went out of life with a B-script. Strangers spoke his eulogy. It was Hollywood glitter, superficial and cold. In the audience were his ex-wife behind the black veil and his estranged daughter and the baby granddaughter he hardly knew and Carrie who’d never really gotten to know her dad as well as she would have liked to. In his speech at graveside Folsey reminisced how upon meeting Vic Morrow for the first time on the Twilight Zone set he was “bitterly disappointed” to learn that the actor was not a registered stock or commodities broker, “since he was more knowledgeable about the market than any broker.” The eulogist continued in this talk-show vein. “We spent a lot of time comparing notes on how each of us had fared in the market during the day, and it was easy to see that anything he was involved in became a total commitment.” Folsey continued, “Just take his acting. In every volt, Blackboard Jungle, Deathwatch, Combat, the power and integrity are so evident. This is why John chose Vic to be the star of the Twilight Zone segment he had written and was directing.” The names of the three movies Folsey mentioned belonged to Morrow’s early years.

Deathwatch belonged to the period of the 50s when, after studying at a small Florida college, Morrow got into stage work and directing off-Broadway productions. He had a role in another off-Broadway production, A Streetcar Named Desire, the play that made Marlon Brando famous in the film version. Morrow’s stage career faltered and he went to Hollywood to try his luck on-screen. In 1955 he played a knife-wielding psychopathic punk in Blackboard Jungle, directed by Richard Brooks. A half-dozen movies followed this mild success in which he became typecast as a soldier in movies like Tribute to a Dead Man and Men in War. His film career ended in a 1961 flop in which he played the lead, called Portrait of a Mobster. Vic Morrow, according to the brief entry in the Encyclopedia of Film, had one character, the “vicious heavy of occasional films.” When from film he got into TV, the “vicious heavy” became the “unshaven tough guy with a warm human side” in his role as the hard-driving Sarge in ABC’s Combat series. Combat ran three years and afterwards, for much of the 70s, Morrow was out of work. He had roles in a few TV movies, the Glass House in 1972 and the 1977 drama Roots. At one point in the 70s his career appeared to be reviving with a role he landed opposite Walther Matthau in The Bad News Bears, in which he played a win-at-any-cost coach who wins the league series but loses the moral victory by slapping his pitcher. The promise didn’t materialize. He returned to playing the vicious heavy in a movie called Funeral for an Assassin and did a Japanese film, Message from Space. During these barren years Morrow’s personal life was a shambles. A bitter and painful marital breakup with Barbara Turner, the mother of his two girls, brought him to the edge. He drank more than ever. He got heavily into drugs. “Hollywood’s first cocaine casualty,” a friend recalled the Vic Morrow of those cheerless years. The floundering actor grew overweight, lazy and depressed. He took to challenging the town that had dumped him without ceremony. At the Polo Lounge where he hung out with his best friend, Billy Fine, Vic Morrow became known as a boozer and brawler, as if the “unshaven tough guy” had stepped out of the script into combat at Hollywood’s choice meeting place for stars and deal-makers.

He saved himself by getting away from Hollywood. He went to Scandinavia, returning sober, slimmed down and to fresh hope when one of the hot young directors offered him his first leading role in a feature film since Portrait of a Mobster more than two decades ago. In his eulogy, Folsey did not neglect to remind the mourners that the makers of the Landis film gave a broken-down actor the chance of a comeback. “Vic and I did not always talk about stocks and such,” Folsey read with his high choirboy voice from his speech. “He often told me how happy he was to be playing this part. We all thought he was terrific, and he was – but what was really wonderful was that Vic knew it. He felt that it was one of the best parts he had ever played. We thought he was giving the performance of his life.” Hollywood hype could mean anything and nothing – even that Vic Morrow’s senseless death was a noble sacrifice. There was a striking correspondence between Folsey’s eulogy and Landis’. Both paid tribute to the TZ movie, a trivial film that would quickly sink into oblivion, as Vic’s bid for immortality. Folsey ended: “If there is one consolation in this terrible situation, it’s that the film is finished. There is nothing more to be shot to make the film work. Thank God, because his performance must not be lost. It represented for him something seldom attained – the culmination of all his idealistic dreams when he was first starting out in acting school in New York. It’s Vic’s last gift to us.” Already on the very day the accident occurred, Dan Allingham began mobilizing crew members to attend the funeral. He had production assistants call people from the set that night and urge them to attend the ceremony. But if the ostensible purpose was to present the crew in unity, it failed with a number of cameramen. Randy Robinson attended the service still terribly upset over the deaths and his own narrow escape. Seated next to him, Roger Smith, the Air Wolf veteran, felt that John Landis was getting away with not having to face up to the responsibility for Vic’s death. Like Robinson, Smith was revolted by the director’s behavior during the ceremony at the Jewish burial ground in Culver City. “It was silly, too light-hearted,” Smith fumed to Robinson over the disrespect shown the deceased.

In the chapel Smith was seated directly behind John Landis and his wife. Deborah was in a plain black dress that emphasized her elongated limbs and strong features. Her husband beside her was characteristically hyper. His hair appeared to be uncombed, his beard untrimmed. Smith saw Landis turn a shaggy profile to his wife and make “some flippant and sarcastic remark.” Roger could see her “sort of laughing.” He considered this the height of disrespect and inexcusable. The revulsion shared by the camera operators became widespread among the mourners after John Landis pushed himself forward to speak. No one outside of Folsey and the Morrow children and their mother knew that as a speaker the eulogist was self-invited. In his piercing falsetto Landis repeated the speech he had read to Folsey over the phone the day before. He stated how happy Morrow had been as an actor. But when he came to mention how just before the last take Vic took him aside to thank him for the “opportunity,” there were ripples of protest. After the funeral Roger Smith drove from the cemetery to a nearby pay telephone. From the corner of Sepulveda and Centinella he placed a call to fellow cameraman Steve Lydecker. Smith was revolted that Landis would take an opportunity such as a funeral to give Vic Morrow’s last performance some sort of creative justification. Smith knew how deeply unhappy Morrow had been on the set, though trying not to show it. Alpha Campbell, quietly, efficiently, continued to run the Landisoffice. On the first day of the new week she sent off the papers requested by Warner Bros. She even drove over to The Burbank Studios that Monday to pick up some boxes said to contain papers pertaining to Vic Morrow and the accident. She escorted the boxes back to the office at Universal, and as she performed these tasks, in her forbearance of all the shady goings-on, she might have been one of those quiet middle-aged ladies with excellently observant eyes and ears in a movie by her former boss, Alfred Hitchcock. Alpha did not contribute to the speculations in the office. Saying she had heard so many versions of the accident she would rather not comment, she stayed out of the discussions.

She swore to herself that one day she would talk honestly about what she thought and how she felt about the accident. She was heartbroken for Trudy, Vic’s nice English girlfriend, and never knew anyone so devastated. Trudy had told her that Vic knew something was wrong that night. Alpha sometimes said that what Trudy had gone through “could drive people to drink or to use drugs to forget.” The nice English girl seemed to be reproaching herself for having permitted Vic to do the scene. And the same might be said of Donna Schuman’s feelings in regard to the kids. Like Landis’ personal secretary, Donna Schuman had been too distraught to go to Vic’s funeral, but the next day she showed up at Twilight Zone Productions at her regular time. Regardless of the tragedy the film had to be finished. But Donna was unable to concentrate that Monday. She waited for midday. Folsey had promised to take her to lunch. What Donna really wanted to know from Folsey at lunch was how far they were responsible for what had happened. She clutched at the hope of some assurance that would absolve her. The question was the extent to which they were tainted by the miserable affair. Dr. Schuman did not know the Chens, he only briefly met Dr. Daniel Le. But he knew that the children would be working without permits. Nor could his wife avoid hearing in the days before the final shooting all sorts of talk around the office about helicopters and explosives in the scenes where the kids were being used. After the children were hired she even asked Folsey about the penalty for working them without permits on the set, and heard Folsey’s flippant repartee, ^(*)Oh , nothing much. A slap on the wrist and maybe a little fine unless they find out about the explosives, and then they’ll probably throw us in jail.” It was hardly comforting, but she silenced her own alarm. One of Donna Schuman’s jobs was to distribute the call sheets to the production watchdogs at Warner, and the day before the shooting she believed she heard Allingham give her strange instructions not to send the paperwork over to Warner until everyone had left their offices for the location.

Her doubts and ambivalence told her that she was not quit of responsibility for the children, and so she was not at all amused when just a day or so prior to the final shooting she saw the director with gangly legs and milling arms and heard him shriek in reference to the film’s final scene, “It’s going to be BI-I-I-I-G!” Once Donna Schuman had asked Folsey if Landis was a coke user. Folsey absolutely denied it and Donna believed him. The director’s hyper behavior appeared to be the result of something unsettled and chaotic in his makeup that made him mad for action of any type. He appeared to be under a compulsion to be always asserting himself, even if only to pop his head into the door of the office and startle everyone by shouting, “Bi-i-i-ii-g!” On one occasion, ”in one kind of sick joke,” as Donna recalled, John Landis was scurrying down the hall throwing his hands up in the air and shouting about the illegal hiring of the kids, “We’re all going to jail! We’re all going to jail!” That the children would be exposed to danger was perhaps hardly to be thought of by those in the office, who, like Donna Schuman, were chiefly bothered by the illegality. But Donna heard Folsey in a telephone conversation reassure the parents of Renee, “It’s nothing – it’s just like fireworks,” and she was awakened to the possibility of danger to the children. It became clear to her that a massive deception was on foot. She heard about changes in the script and how the last scene had been added and the character of it changed. And after learning that Alpha Campbell kept the scripts locked in a desk she gathered that the kids were to be kept concealed from the Warner people; and she felt powerless to influence the events which she herself had helped set in motion. When at about noon George Folsey Jr. walked into the office an alteration was evident in him, too. Like John Landis and Donna Schuman and everyone else involved in the wretched affair, George Folsey suffered. There was the effect on his octogenarian father who was ailing, and on his mother.

Folsey grew up a happy child in a warm, supportive family. As an only child he was afforded the very best. He graduated from one of Southern California’s most prestigious schools, Pomona College. Along with a happy marriage, one fine son and a daughter, he had a bona fide name in the film industry. He was an Anglophile, a little snobby, a “small” millionaire with one extravagant hobby, collecting Rolls-Royces – and over this sunny life now fell the shadow of Indian Dunes. About midday on Monday, July 26, while George Folsey and Don-na Schuman lunched at Hampton’s, a discontented crowd of re-porters could be seen milling in a glaring sun before the monolithic building known as TBS, The Burbank Studios. Among the media men and women, the “carrot-top cub” looked on with his freckled face as a small party of people from the different investigative agencies entered the building. Only the party of officials was authorized to go up to the Warner screening room for the first semi-public viewing of the film of the “Twilight Zone” crash. The press was excluded from this special screening, a denial that also excluded the reporters from welcome drafts of climate-controlled air. They wilted in the heat. Andy Furillo waited an hour before he saw the same party file out again. He spotted Charlie Hughes. The crusty labor investigator had just dropped a subpoena on Warner Bros., for their contracts with the children. It had taken an immense amount of doing on Llorente’s part. Early on Monday he was at TBS, meeting with Stanley Belkin, Warner’s Hollywood corporate counsel. In the name of the NTSB Llorente had already taken possession of the crippled aircraft at Indian Dunes and now he had with him a subpoena for both the film of the accident and the negative of the film which had already been in the studio’s possession, processed and all, mere hours following the accident. Llorente decided to use diplomacy. He wanted Warner to cooperate and he needed a trade-off. He fixed on the knot of press people outside the studio gate. Knowing how worried the studio must be by their presence, Llorente promised Belkin to exclude the media from seeing the film. But even more appealing from the film company’s standpoint was Llorente’s further offer not to talk to the press at all until he made his findings public. At this early point in the investigation, a mere three days after the accident, Warner Bros., already faced a formidable host of legal problems.

But even more appealing from the film company’s standpoint was Llorente’s further offer not to talk to the press at all until he made his findings public. At this early point in the investigation, a mere three days after the accident, Warner Bros., already faced a formidable host of legal problems. Ready to pounce upon it at any moment with subpoenas were a half-dozen state and local agencies. The studio faced the possibility of criminal charges to be filed by the DA’s office, wrongful death actions, administrative proceedings and the possibility of one or more jury trials in the future. The deal with the NTSB man was one the studio couldn’t refuse. Llorente’s offer to exclude the press guarded against possible leaks in the media. At the same time it insulated the film from further subpoenas, since the NTSB as an arm of the federal government superseded all the other agencies involved in the investigation. Fear of their exposure to allegations of a cocaine cover-up helped explain why the studio accepted Llorente’s offer and agreed that the film be shown that very afternoon. Even in the earliest phases of the investigation, the NTSB man was faced with overwhelming news coverage pointing directly to the widespread use of drugs – specifically cocaine – on many Hollywood film sets. In that summer of 1982, headline stories fixed on rampant drug use in the film industry, underscored by the overdose death of John Belushi, reinforced the feelings that drugs may have been involved. It turned out that Llorente told reporters that he was investigating the possibility that cocaine was being used prior to the crash. The celebrity news chatter carried stories on cocaine used by many Spielberg stars, in particular, Jaws star Richard Dreyfuss, who rolled his car on a Beverley Hills street and was charged with possession of cocaine; or producer and former business partner Julia Phillips who produced Close Encounters of the Third Kind, admitted spending over 1 million dollars on her cocaine habit. She said it all started on location on Close Encounters. And, due to John Belushi’s death, the L.A. Grand Jury called Robert De Niro and Robin Williams to testify about their admitted escapades with the comedian the night before his overdose and death. A NY Times article quoted police authorities describing Hollywood’s cocaine distribution rings as being as common as ice cream trucks in delivering drugs to movie sets. Other celebrities made the news with their cocaine habits, including Robert Evans, producer, and Linda Blair and McKenzie Phillips.

Under the NTSB procedure Warner was given assurance that no one would see the film except those with a legitimate interest. The film’s first “semi-public” screening included Llorente’s team, consisting of assistants deputized and sworn in hastily over the past few days. They were joined in the TBS screening room by investigators from the FBI, FAA, the LA County Sheriff ’s Department, the California Labor Commissioner and Cal/OSHA, the California office of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration. The viewers also included representatives from several unions, as well as experts from the Bell Helicopter Company and Western Helicopter, the manufacturer and owner of the helicopter, respectively. These were the members of the party, about 20 in all, that Andy Furillo saw file into the TBS building’s long shady corridors. On the hot sidewalk he had reason to reflect that it was a sad day when the press was “excluded.” Yet, unbeknownst then to either, Don Llorente would make ample amends and not forget the likable young cub with the freckled face and flaming thatch. Before the year was out, he would leak to Furillo amazing facts of his Twilight Zone investigation. Warner Studios had not yet been charged with anything. The NTSB investigation only focused on an industrial accident and had no criminal bearing. These were thought of as problems of the longer range. At the moment the studio sought only to contain the damage that grew out of its involvement in the illegal hiring. Its entire film production might be forced out of California by the suspension of its permit to hire children. In those first few days Warner’s corporate office was still as much in the dark as to the cause of the crash as the investigators were. Without more information the company’s officers feared revelations that could be even more damaging than the illegal employment of children on a movie set. They knew about the cocaine binges associated with Landis’ Belushi movies. Some among the studio brass envisioned a worst-case scenario; a Belushi-type drug orgy on the Twilight Zone set ending in decapitation and dismemberment. Bracing itself, the studio adopted a siege mentality; it, too, “froze.” At stake for the studio, apart from the future of the TZ film project itself, was something more than the reputation of John Landis. The studio’s nascent relationship with the TZ film’s famous co-producer, Steven Spielberg, represented much more than John Landis did, a precious asset with lucrative economic potential.

Warner’s high hopes were relevant to the mood of that strange summer of ’82 when Hollywood, in the grip of Spielbergmania, felt like the Klondike. Every studio wanted “Spielberg product,” including Warner. E.T. from Universal and Poltergeist from 20th Century Fox put competing Spielberg product in rival movie houses, an unheard-of break with Hollywood practice in film distribution. Through its deal on the TZ movie Warner joined the other two studios by having Spielberg product on the shelf. Only Steven Spielberg could make films for two different studios and have them released simultaneously, while at the same time a third studio was financing another of his movies in the making. Moreover, on paper it looked like Warner had Spielberg product at a bargain-basement price. In terms of the rising costs of movie-making Warner had made an astute deal by getting some of the top directors to work on the project for a reasonably small investment. At the time, Spielberg was a $2 millionplus-per-picture director; Landis $1 million-plus, and George Miller, the Australian director of Road Warrior fame, and Joe Dante who had made The Howling and Piranha, received slightly less than Landis. Yet the whole Spielberg-Landis co-production was budgeted for $5 million! The wellknown directors involved in the film would ordinarily have absorbed the film’s total budget. Hollywood offered few bargains like that. Warner was able to keep the up-front costs low because it did not have to pay the high directors’ fees. Eventually the TZ movie was to earn $34 million dollars on an $8 million-dollar investment, yielding a not very shabby $2.5 million dollars each for Landis and Spielberg; but in the immediate aftermath of the tragedy at Indian Dunes it looked briefly as if the movie might never get off the ground. To protect Spielberg, the TZ project, and perhaps its own ability to make films in California, everything depended on how quickly Warner Bros., acted to defend itself. And by the end of the first Monday, working in a crisis atmosphere, the studio had ready a formidable legal team to safeguard the movie’s financial future, as well as every other flank to which the actions of the brash director had exposed it. The in-house legal team Warner mobilized consisted of Jim Miller, Stanley Belkin and John Schulman. In addition, the studio engaged one of LA’s most noted lawyers, William Vaughn, of O’Melveny & Myers, assisted by an outside criminal lawyer, Douglas Dalton.

It was not lost on the beleaguered movie company that the labor commissioner’s office had no less than three investigators, including Charlie Hughes, at the NTSB screening that afternoon. Warner’s greatest fear must have been that Colleen Logan, Charlie’s boss, would turn over the results of the investigation to the DA’s office for the filing of criminal charges against the famous studio. Meanwhile, another phalanx was being formed across town in the Century City law offices of Silverberg, Leon, Rosen & Behr. Eventually John Landis would consider America’s top lawyers to join this defense team. By that Monday afternoon, a mere three days after the disaster, Joel Behr in his Century City office had already introduced John Landis to one of LA’s top criminal lawyers, a tallish, blond, high-flushed person in his early forties with a reputation for winning acquittals by trying his cases in the press. His name was Harland Braun. Known as the king of LA’s high-profile media lawyers, he had come highly recommended to Behr by an associate who suggested that Braun’s ties to the DA’s office might be helpful. Having previously served in the DA’s office himself as deputy district attorney and prosecutor, Braun was still an active Democrat – the Democrats’ “consiglieri” – at the time when the office of District Attorney John Van de Kamp was heavily Democratic. Braun had discovered the secret of being quotable. He could toss off a pithy remark, a biting sarcasm, an hilarious analogy. He could make a statement of astounding erudition or give a summation so masterfully concise that the courthouse journalists in high-visibility cases would always make room in their reports for one of his lines. Outside the courtroom, in the hallway where the media people swarmed with their hurried questioning, Braun was patient and genial. But the courtroom transformed him. He was no longer genial. He was hardly patient. He had a relentless style, stubborn and dogged, and once committed to an issue, a line of attack, a strategy, he followed it unswervingly with the absolute singlemindedness of a hammer. And so, Behr settled the urgent question of Landis’ criminal defense after marathon discussions with Braun the weekend following the crash. At the time Braun was with his wife and two children up in his family hideaway at Lake Arrowhead, 60 miles east of Los Angeles. Up in his mountain retreat, Braun spent the weekend listening to Behr in Los Angeles narrate long-distance the story of the bigot who redeems himself in Vietnam by saving", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634243667_cleaned.txt:79:3c7c1575b11a", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 1683, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634243667_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634243667", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634243667_cleaned", "chunk_index": 80, "text": "absolute singlemindedness of a hammer. And so, Behr settled the urgent question of Landis’ criminal defense after marathon discussions with Braun the weekend following the crash. At the time Braun was with his wife and two children up in his family hideaway at Lake Arrowhead, 60 miles east of Los Angeles. Up in his mountain retreat, Braun spent the weekend listening to Behr in Los Angeles narrate long-distance the story of the bigot who redeems himself in Vietnam by saving two children from a village that’s being rocketed by Americans. Braun learned that while shooting the scene Landis, after seeing the helicopter suddenly drop from the foreground, went around the helicopter and saw that the children had been killed. The authorities, Behr informed Braun, “knew almost immediately that the kids did not have papers.” Landis did not get the permit because of the night-hours violation, Behr said. At the request of the NTSB’s Llorente, an interview with John Landis was agreed to and scheduled for Wednesday, the day following the funerals of the two children. The NTSB was merely a fact-finding team, concerned only with determining the probable cause of the accident. It published its findings but had no power to lay charges or enforce the law, nor could it compel anyone to testify. John Landis could have easily refused to be questioned by Llorente. But as Braun put it, Landis would be made “to look like complete horseshit.” The lawyers discussed with the crestfallen film makers what posture to take. According to Braun, the only strategy that really made any sense in terms of public opinion was that of cooperating with the investigators in the hope that when all the facts came out it would be shown that John Landis had not been reckless. Braun said that he felt that they had a shot at avoiding an indictment on the manslaughter charges because it was an “accident.” Technically, the violations of child labor laws were only misdemeanor criminal violations. By joining in a conspiracy to break those laws Landis and his associates could face felony charges. But still all this was on the assumption that the damage could be controlled and there would be no criminal violations worse than the conspiracy to break the laws; that is, Braun felt, they would have been charged with hiring the kids illegally. Harland Braun returned to his office, which was just down vast sundrenched Century Plaza. Its horizon was bounded by towering buildings. The population of Century City, dominated by the Century Plaza Hotel where the president stayed on his visits to Los Angeles, was made up of lawyers, and everywhere, figures could be seen sunk in thought like Harland Braun pondering his new case.

He was to meet with Joel Behr again that evening at Warner’s Burbank office to see the film of the accident. At Vic Morrow’s funeral on Sunday the press was said to have beenreasonably “behaved,” whereas during the funerals on Tuesday children on a movie set brought out strong emotional reactions. By Tuesday, a lot more was known about the crash. The ceremonies saw a great amount of elbowing and jostling by the media people. At Renee’s funeral in the morning the crush was so intense that one of the family members was almost pushed into the little grave. Again self-invited, Landis and his Hollywood entourage burst upon the private grief of the Asian mourners. John Landis looked as if since the carnage at Indian Dunes he had stopped troubling himself about his hair and beard; he looked unshaven and uncombed. With appalling lack of delicacy this bohemian figure faced Mark Chen, the Chinese accountant, who looked upon him as the murderer of his little daughter. The presence of John Landis turned the ceremonies into a fracas. During the funeral of the little girl he fled around the chapel hotly pursued by TV cameramen, his wife Deborah in tow, along with his two longtime friends, Sean Daniel and Saul Kahan. The media people found outside the chapel a mini-press conference in progress. It was conducted by Donna Schuman. Her husband Hal stood at her side. Both were grim and white-faced. They quickly drew attention from Universal’s Sean Daniel, who with Landis’ wife, friends and publicists formed a defensive flank around the director. Donna Schuman shouted at the slight-built ashen figure: Six-year-old Renee Chen was certainly pretty enough to be in a Hollywood movie. Her parents were quiet, industrious immigrants from Taiwan. They loved their daughter and felt proud that she was already a Hollywood star. The little girl was even more excited than her parents. She couldn’t keep her innocent wonder to herself and kept talking about it to all her little friends on the quiet Pasadena street where the family lived. Afterwards Renee’s mother was led outside to one of the eight canvas chairs that had been set up near the small grave just outside a line of trees. It was dug in a hillside and laden with flowers. Renee’s father watched aghast as the metal coffin was lowered. Peter Chen, his brother, caught him as he stumbled towards his wife, crying, “She was the only child I had!

Now she is gone!” George Folsey Jr. had arranged for a Warner car to take the Schumans to the children’s funerals. It so happened that their chauffeur had been on the set the night of the crash and after attending Renee’s funeral he became so emotionally distraught that Hal Schuman ended up taking over the wheel; as the Schumans took the chauffeur home the rest of the Hollywood cortege hurtled on down the Golden State Freeway to Cerittos, a 30-mile drive southeast into LA’s sea of suburbia. Unlike the Chen funeral, with its emotional trauma, that of Myca Le was restrained. The Hollywood entourage trailed by the press fell into the subdued mood of the Lutheran church in Cerritos. Prayers were offered in Vietnamese. The choir sang Myca’s favorite hymn, “Jesus Loves All the Children of the World.” Myca had been a member of the choir. Everyone remembered the little boy’s goodness, obedience and religious devotion. “I know only two languages now,” the pastor in his eulogy quoted one of Myca’s sayings as remembered by the dead boy’s first grade teacher, “but I want to know as many languages as I can, because some day I want to go around the world and tell people that God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son.” It was also remembered that once in class when the children were asked which among them was most like Jesus, everyone as with one voice chorused, “Myca.” Both Myca’s parents were social workers. They went through the services, after quietly receiving condolences, with a bearing of disciplined dignity. The sadness was replete with ironies personal to themselves. Myca had been named in gratitude for the countries where Daniel and Kim had studied for their degrees, $ { { } ^ { } } { } { } ^ { { } { } }$ for the United States and “Ca” for Canada, countries where they “remembered kind people.” While still living in Vietnam, Myca’s father used to watch regularly Vic Morrow in Combat, a favorite on Saigon TV. The Les left their country just before the fall of Saigon. Both had large families still there and before the service began the pastor announced that it was being recorded for Myca’s relatives in Vietnam. The country was now Communist. It took many weeks for the mail to get there.

All that time the busy movie maker followed to the painful letter Joel Behr’s instructions not to speak publicly about that night. To the world the young director gave the impression that, buried in moviemaking, bringing the world his rambunctious comic vision, he had left behind this dismal period in his career. Throughout the years he made public his understanding and feelings about the tragedy a total of no more than three times, always with lawyers at his side, sometimes as many as four, like a string quartet led by a longhaired, bearded conductor. John Landis spoke most fully about the events at Indian Dunes at his trial in the spring of 1987. The only other times were during the NTSB interview five days after the crash on Wednesday afternoon, July 28, 1982, and briefly to an Los Angeles Times reporter regarding a controversy in the case that briefly flared up in December that same year. Conducted by Don Llorente, the NTSB interview was held in the Century City offices of attorney Joel Behr. Landis’ personal lawyer had completed assembly of the legal phalanx to protect his client within 72 hours from the time of the crash. From the standpoint of priorities, the criminal attorney was the most important. Harland Braun’s bailiwick consisted of all the criminal issues likely to be prosecuted by the district attorney’s office, primarily the illegal hiring of the children. But the accident touched many agencies, not just the DA’s office. To deal with agencies on the California state level like Cal/OSHA and Charlie Hughes from the Labor Commission, Behr engaged a specialist in labor questions, Andy Peterson, of the firm of Paul, Hastings, Janofsky and Walker. Anticipating many millions in damage claims from the grieving parents and the heirs of Vic Morrow, Behr also hired Martin Rose of Kern & Wooley for the civil side. Thusly insulated by his lawyer and confidant Joel Behr, in addition to the buffers of some half-dozen additional lawyers (eventually to include Landis’ own private eye), the director was from the very beginning well-cushioned against an increasingly curious public and an army of investigators.

Already at this early stage a half-dozen law firms were being kept busy just by Warner and John Landis alone; and their number was to grow as the crash became a controversy involving more and more people. By the time the trial commenced four years later they constituted an entire industry, absorbing enormous sums, spread over the towers of Century City. When he sat down for his first public comments on the case the Wednesday following the crash, Landis’ problems were not merely confined to the investigative bodies. Public opinion was being shaped by forces over which, at least initially, he had no control. Among the TZ crew there was a universal feeling of dismay about the way the investigation was going in its opening phase. Crew members spread rumors about Landis’ relationship with the pretty female who was his personal driver on the production. Others like Roger Smith, the helicopter cameraman, and Steve Lydecker, the master shot, had openly begun to speak their minds. Even Steven Larner, Landis’ director of photography (he would later win an Emmy for the TV film Winds of War), made some very pointed remarks about the safety on the set. Cameraman Randy Robinson repeated to the press the by now notorious “lower, lower” quote, and the pilot’s description of the fire-engulfed helicopter was quotably pungent-”It felt like being shot out of the sun.” But fortunately for John Landis, his NTSB interview occurred at a time when the news people and investigators were as yet unable to contact most of the crew who had been closely involved in the set. Paul Stewart was off getting drunk with Jerry Williams, who had a boat. Others were scattered to distant points. Hilary Leach was in London. Dan Allingham and set designer Richard Sawyer were together in Hawaii. Even 2nd AD Andy House left for France the day after the disastrous wrap. From the very first, Andy House appeared to be the person who might break the case wide open. Still wearing the bright orange shirt he’d worn on the set, the 2nd AD had gone home from the Indian Dunes disaster and cried. When Allingham in an effort to recruit him for the funerals called the next day, House had explained that his wife was waiting for him in Paris for a brief vacation that had been planned long in advance. Just before boarding the plane, House stopped at Elie Cohn’s office on the Paramount lot to pick up a jacket the 1st AD had borrowed from him on the set. After Universal and Paramount, Warner Bros.

Just before boarding the plane, House stopped at Elie Cohn’s office on the Paramount lot to pick up a jacket the 1st AD had borrowed from him on the set. After Universal and Paramount, Warner Bros. Inc. ranked third in revenues among the big three Hollywood studios at the time of the crash. Its golden shield consisting of the two WB initials was an indelible logo in American brand-name culture, setting off in people’s minds Looney Tunes and movie titles with all-American heroes and heroines like Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergman. The obviously undesirable effects on public opinion of the fatalities on one of its movie sets worried the studio. Its fate was now hitched to that of the young director. The dead children bound them together. From a legal standpoint, Landis and his group were agents of Warner and the studio as financier of the film could be held responsible for the actions of its stunt-happy director. On Tuesday, July 27, the day before Landis’ meeting with the NTSB, William Vaughn and his assistant Scott Dunham from Warner’s law firm of O’Melveny & Myers visited Charlie Hughes at the LA labor commissioner’s office downtown. Vaughn personally served Hughes with a limited supply of documents subpoenaed the day before from Warner to determine the studio’s involvement in the illegal hiring of the children. The appearance of one of LA’s most powerful lawyers at Charlie Hughes’ shabby downtown office was not lost on the investigators of the labor commission. William Vaughn was chief litigator for LA’s oldest law firm, which had its entertainment law business headquartered in Century City. O’Melveny & Myers’ lasting Hollywood connections began in 1929 with Bing Crosby, including among later clients Mary Pickford, Ingrid Bergman, Jack Benny, Gene Autry, James Stewart, Gary Cooper, William Holden and institutional clients like Paramount, Walt Disney and CBS, whose anchorman, Dan Rather, would be successfully defended by William Vaughn in a 1983 libel suit. The fact that Bill Vaughn, generally recognized as O’Melveny’s top trial lawyer, spearheaded the efforts by the studio to escape punishment from the labor commissioner signaled how much Warner feared having its permit to use children revoked. They were up against Charlie Hugh’s formidable boss, Colleen Logan. Aside from heading up the labor commission’s LA office, Colleen Logan had drafted the original language of the laws governing the employment of children in the California motion picture industry. In Hollywood she became known after wrangling with high-profile child labor cases such as that involving Brooke Shields, a minor at the time.

Aside from heading up the labor commission’s LA office, Colleen Logan had drafted the original language of the laws governing the employment of children in the California motion picture industry. In Hollywood she became known after wrangling with high-profile child labor cases such as that involving Brooke Shields, a minor at the time. As the guardian of child film actors she’d been known to override Hollywood mothers willing to do anything to get their kids in pictures. In one of her most notable decisions, she turned down California’s former governor Edmund Brown. Brown confronted Logan in her office with four other lawyers and personally lobbied for the studio’s efforts to approve a permit for foul language to be used by 12-year-old Jody Foster. As the result of Logan’s refusal to grant an exemption, the movie Taxi Driver with the under-age Jody Foster was banned from being filmed in California. But with the involvement of Warner the pressures on the labor commissioner took on an unprecedented form. On July 30, two days following Vaughn’s visit to Hughes, Colleen Logan’s boss in Sacramento, Patrick Henning, flew down to Los Angeles and during a July 30, press conference called the crash at Indian Dunes an “obscene tragedy.” Henning said it “would never have occurred if the child labor laws of the state had been followed.” He pointed the finger directly at Warner. “Executives in the motion picture industry know these strict laws well,” Henning remarked. He planned to take no actions against the parents. The labor commissioner believed that they had already paid the ultimate price. But he issued a $5, 000 citation each, the maximum allowable under the labor code, against the corporation, Warner Bros., Inc. and three individuals, John Landis, George Folsey Jr. and Dan Allingham. The omission from the list of citations of Frank Marshall’s name was conspicuous and perhaps due to a lack of general understanding by investigators of the hierarchy on a Hollywood movie production. Traditionally Marshall, the executive producer who, as Spielberg’s man, was present during the shooting of the fatal scene, actually exceeded John Landis in authority on the set. Yet, the only investigating agency to mention Marshall was Cal/OSHA when it cited four companies with nine violations of safety practices during the filming. Included among the Cal/OSHA list of citations was an obscure entity called Twilight Zone Productions and among the names cited, along with George Folsey Jr. and John Landis, was Frank Marshall. On Tuesday, the day following the first viewing of the crash footage, Don Llorente returned to TBS. The footage was again projected in the screening room before freshly assembled investigators. There was a total of three clips in the NTSB’s possession. The first showed the 11:30 rage scene.

There was a total of three clips in the NTSB’s possession. The first showed the 11:30 rage scene. The second clip was a most innocent looking cut filmed by one camera, no more than a minute in length, which the clapperboard that opens and identifies the scene designated “DOCU,” with the time, 2:00, as “DOCU/2:00.” The final clip showed the shocking 2:20 final scene. Missing, however, was the first scene recorded that evening, the 9:30 rescue sequence, where the helicopter was off-camera and in the air, its engines and rotors running to create a wind effect. This shot, important in showing the proximity of Vic, the children and explosives early in the evening, would evade every investigator, including the DA’s office, until oneand-one-half years later when it accidentally surfaced prior to the trial. Also missing – and never to surface – was the crucial second soundtrack. Of the clips in the accident footage only the final 2:20 scene was subjected to a minute, frame-by-frame analysis as investigators attempted to determine exactly how the SFX explosives had caused the crash. That same Tuesday when the children were being buried, Llorente spent in the TBS screening room. He went through the blowups of each frame recorded by a half-dozen cameras. As the action unfolded in a series of soundless images, the questions formed themselves in the viewer’s mind. How was the scene planned? What preparations were made? How were the scenes coordinated? What was the communication set-up like? What size were the explosives? Who was in charge? How was the helicopter positioned in relation to the explosives? Where were the stuntmen? And the kids?… Llorente was not satisfied. The NTSB man knew that whatever people saw that night would very quickly become transformed and he wanted to question these people before that happened. For the first few days no one could say with any certainty what brought the gunship down. John Landis himself conjectured that it might have been the lid of a glue pot accidentally hurled into the helicopter by a special-effects explosive. So, in order to find out what had happened, Llorente was to interview subjects from the ranks of the set; from the cameramen, special effects men, grips, electricians and the truck driver who claimed he saw Steven Spielberg on the set at the time of the accident, to the director who insisted he bore no blame in the event.

Though Elie Cohn, the 1st AD, was questioned, the NTSB failed to interview Andy House, third after Landis and Cohn in authority on the set. Neither did the NTSB record what Dick Vane, the location manager with close ties to the Spielberg organization, knew about the size and placement of the explosives, even though the NTSB was aware that Vane engaged a record number of FSOs for the shooting of the final scene. The absence of Frank Marshall from Llorente’s list was to become the pattern throughout the case. The net was passing over the man who as the film’s executive producer and Spielberg’s righthand man was present when the crash occurred. When Llorente once tried to get Marshall’s cooperation, he was convinced by the film maker’s lawyer, Rick Rosen, that Marshall had no knowledge of any of the events, being “just an executive on the set.” Neither did Llorente succeed in interviewing Landis’ co-producer Steven Spielberg. The NTSB accepted a statement from Spielberg that he was not on the location at the time of the accident. It was the only time that Spielberg was required to address the extent of his involvement in the crash. began, John Landis had not changed in appearance from his first meeting two days earlier with his criminal attorney, Harland Braun. Braun’s operative word in describing his new client had been “shaggy” ”shaggy hair, shaggy beard, shaggy clothes.” The bohemian air of the au teur came from all that hair and once deprived of it, as he would be for his trial four years later, he looked suddenly much younger than his 35 years; with the vanished hair he looked a cross between Jerry Lewis and Alfred E. Neuman, an astonishing transformation; with his cropped head and face he looked like a high school student who might be – for there was a strange resemblance between them – Steven Spielberg’s goofy younger brother! Landis was surrounded by the phalanx of $200 -an-hour Century City lawyers. They were like a cabinet with their premier Joel Behr. Behr was assisted by John Diemer who with a prematurely receding hairline still exuded a round-faced collegiate look. Diemer, just two years out of UCLA Law School, had in the Twilight Zone his first big Hollywood case. From the very first day, immersed in investigating all the child labor laws that might have been violated by Landis, Folsey and Allingham, Diemer emerged as Behr’s righthand man.

From the very first day, immersed in investigating all the child labor laws that might have been violated by Landis, Folsey and Allingham, Diemer emerged as Behr’s righthand man. He was indispensable by the time the grand jury convened a year later. Diemer sat close to Behr during the NTSB interview with Landis. In addition to Diemer and criminal counsel Harland Braun, the Landis legal phalanx, primarily in connection with the expected civil lawsuits, included Martin Rose of Kern & Wooley, the LA law firm that specialized in aircraft accidents. “We took the position,” Braun reasoned, “to be very cooperative on anything dealing with safety on the set. We didn’t want to deliver to them a case of conspiracy to hire the kids and then cover up. We weren’t sure how far that thing would spread, and we knew we’d probably get charged with it anyway.” Landis stumbled, Behr quickly intervened; Landis went “off the record,” as he did nearly 30 times during the proceeding. The movie director and his lawyer whispered so the tapes would not record the highly delicate question of how to define the director’s job. For by defining the actual level of the director’s authority serious questions could be raised as to the extent of his actual responsibility for the crash. Thus, in replying to the NTSB man, the film maker witness narrowly defined a director’s role on the set as “the placement of cameras and actors.” In so doing Landis pointed the finger at others. In his view, the director had to rely on what others did on the set. But as he admitted with aggrieved resignation, citing a Hollywood story, the director ultimately would be held accountable: “Alfred Hitchcock said, ‘The director is the one who gets the blame,’ so I mean, you know, that’s what the director’s function is. He’s the person who makes the movie.” By vaguely defining his role on the set, Landis tried to distance himself from the event, and since no one as yet knew exactly what had caused the fatal crash, his veiled accusations went unchallenged. He suggested names of other people possibly with knowledge related to the incident: Fred Gallo, Warner’s chief of worldwide production; Lucy Fisher, now VP at Warner’s; and Terry Semel, Warner president. Landis mentioned that all of them had read the script and approved it. He also mentioned that Steven Spielberg was his co-producer; but Joel Behr was quick to squelch, “Mr. Spielberg had nothing, and has nothing to do with the production of this particular episode at all.” “You know how the village’s here,” Landis began. “There’s a river here, and here’s", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634243667_cleaned.txt:89:a6edf58bf0b3", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 1693, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634243667_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634243667", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634243667_cleaned", "chunk_index": 90, "text": "incident: Fred Gallo, Warner’s chief of worldwide production; Lucy Fisher, now VP at Warner’s; and Terry Semel, Warner president.

I was on the island, and my attention was focused on Vic and the kids. Once I thought where the copter was basically okay, I said okay. Fine. Action. And my cue for Vic was, I had a megaphone, and I go like this for Vic, so Vic can see me. Vic and the kids started across the river. My attention was on Vic and the kids. I was not watching the helicopter. I watched Vic and the kids. The explosions went off. Everything was going off as I assumed it was. “Yeah,” Llorente pressed on dryly, going back to his original question, whether Landis had directed the helicopter to fly lower. “Did you have any direct communication with the helicopter pilot?” Avoiding a direct answer, Landis replied that in earlier takes he used a walkie-talkie to communicate with Allingham, who was sitting next to Wingo. “Well, two things, Landis answered. “One, I couldn’t because there’s too much noise, but also, I truly don’t – I was asking Joel. I truly don’t – I was asking Joel. I truly don’t remember. I wasn’t told – I don’t remember. No, I don’t remember that. I don’t know. It’s the truth. I don’t – I was holding on. I was holding a megaphone… The blue and white “bullhorn” that Landis used to shout orders all night had become identified with his persona. The megaphone was a new electronic type which amplified the voice to a volume that could be heard over the greatest noise. For some time, the investigators regarded it as the symbol of the director’s authority on the set. They debated for a long time whether Landis used this instrument to shout “lower, lower,” while at the same time waving it, thereby deliberately bringing the helicopter into a lethal special-effects firestorm. However, since Landis denied having given the order for the helicopter to come lower either through his bullhorn or walkie-talkie, the focus shifted to the person next in the communication chain to the pilot. Seated next to Wingo and operating the spotlight at the time of the crash, perhaps Dan Allingham, Llorente assumed, had communicated the fatal command to the pilot. But when asked to clarify this vital question, Landis’ lawyer, now serving as Allingham’s counsel too, objected that his client was being asked to speculate. Landis, saying he didn’t understand the question, concurred. “At any time", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634243667_cleaned.txt:90:2d929d274162", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 1694, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634243667_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634243667", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634243667_cleaned", "chunk_index": 91, "text": "bullhorn or walkie-talkie, the focus shifted to the person next in the communication chain to the pilot.

But when asked to clarify this vital question, Landis’ lawyer, now serving as Allingham’s counsel too, objected that his client was being asked to speculate. Landis, saying he didn’t understand the question, concurred. “At any time when you’re shooting the film,” Landis broke in excitedly, “or when you’re not shooting the film the pilot has total control of the aircraft. I’ve worked with helicopters many, many times in films. In the Blues Brothers we did extraordinary helicopter stuff. In fact, I’ve made some of the biggest stunt movies of all time. When a stunt man says to you, ‘This is too dangerous,’ or a pilot says, ‘I cannot do this,’ which happens a lot, you then say, ‘Okay, we’ve got to think of something else.’ I’m not God. I can’t fucking say well, you know, these visions of Erich Von Stroheim, ‘Blow them all up!’ I mean, what is that? Of course, the pilot is the only one who has the responsibility where to put the copter. I wasn’t flying the helicopter, and neither was Dan.” In determining the director’s responsibility in relation to the crash two elements were crucial. One was the positioning of the helicopter, the other concerned the placement and timing of the explosives. At this point John Landis did not appear to think that the disaster at Indian Dunes had anything to do with the timing of the special-effects explosions. Nor did he mention anything about the series of explosives going off in the wrong place or prematurely. There was nothing in his statement to the NTSB investigators to suggest that the two explosions that went off on the shoreline nearest the action, which ultimately were identified as those that brought down the helicopter, were any other than a series that had been planned: “Everything was going off as I assumed it was,” he had already indicated. Llorente passed the questioning to the Cal-OSHA lawyer, Marilyn Levine. She asked if there were any written plans for the sequence with the helicopter flying and the explosions going off. Cavalierly, the director allowed, “There were lots of thumbnail sketches.” As for blueprints, he couldn’t remember. The lawyers laughed, albeit uncomfortably. But Llorente and his team took it altogether seriously. It settled in their minds who had authority on the set. After persistently toe-dancing around the question of the director’s responsibility Landis indicated that the set was wherever he found himself, including his lawyer’s office in Century City.

In wanting to know what brought the craft down, Llorente had a few basic questions. Were adequate precautions taken to ensure that the flight would be safely away from explosives when they were set off? Did John Landis do enough after having been warned of potential trouble following the 11:30, next-to-last shot? Quoting Wingo’s complaints about the 11:30 shot, Landis made it appear that the pilot was concerned about flying too close to the cliff when, in fact, Wingo had been worried about being too close to the explosives in the village. According to Landis, Wingo had come to him after that shot, and asked, “’When we do the next one, can I be out over the river?’ And I said, ‘Yes, of course.’ And we discussed that, and I decided that the helicopter should be much further over the river.” He told the NTSB that as the result of the complaints at 11:30 he repositioned the helicopter during a 2:00 “rehearsal.” This meant that there had actually been four helicopter flights that night, three of which were actual film clips – the 9:30 rescue sequence, the 11:30 rage scene, and the 2:20 final shot. The so-called “rehearsal” flight at 2 : 00A.M ., in which the craft was allegedly “repositioned,” had appeared on the screen at the special screenings. Sandwiched between the footage of the 11:30 rage scene and the 2:20 fatal shot, this “rehearsal” footage showed John Landis waving his bullhorn in an effort to locate the helicopter and its powerful Nite-Sun into the desired position for the big, finale shot. This unusual scene opened with a mysterious clapperboard indication: the viewers read “DOCU/ 2:00^(′) on the screen. This clip was the only flight of the helicopter that night that was not part of the shooting schedule – it was a “rehearsal,” Landis explained to Llorente, which, according to Landis’ scenario, came as the direct result of the complaints from the helicopter crew during the 11:30 rage scene. By positioning the helicopter in a new spot ”over the river,” the director suggested that the “rehearsal” flight showed that the chopper was supposed to be a safe distance away from the explosions. His answer brought another halt to the proceedings. Without realizing it, his remark was potentially devastating. The most startled person in the room was Harland Braun.

He had mentioned pre-planned positions, safety precautions and a 2:00 o’clock “rehearsal” for the final shot. And suddenly he shattered this placid picture by expressing lack of concern about the most important safety consideration of the shot. As Braun put it, recalling his client’s notorious gaffe, “What bothers you on something like that is the emphasis.” he recollections of what happened that night of the crash in Indian Dunes was like Rashomon, the film classic by the Japanese director Kurosawa, in which a crime occurs and as each witness tells what he or she saw the viewer gets a different perspective on what happened. The same theme might have applied to the stories of eyewitnesses to the Twilight Zone disaster. Depending on where people were standing at the time of the accident, how close to the set they were, whether they were watching Vic or the helicopter, and numerous other variations, it was un derstandable that there would be many versions of the actual occurrence. The Rashomon effect came into play each time Llorente compared the above- with the below-the-line version. Above-the-line, the recollections of Landis, Allingham, Cohn and Folsey basically formed a consistent version. Later on, Llorente and his team, treated to the Rashomon effect from below-the-line, would see everything take a radical turn. The day following the Landis interview, Llorente interviewed Dan Allingham. The NTSB investigator had actually been given a thumbnail definition of Allingham’s job the previous day by the director, who compared the unit production manager to the plant manager; the “guy on the line responsible for making the deals.” At his NTSB session Allingham was flanked by the Landis legal phalanx, including Harland Braun and Joel Behr with his assistant John Diemer. Behr hovered over the struggling witness, frequently assisting to refresh his memory. At times Allingham’s answers to questions seemed to be more specific than Landis, while on others his memory seemed unreliable. Allingham told the panel he didn’t know whether he received instructions like “lower, lower” over the radio. He didn’t remember “a heck of a lot” of this scene. His further appearance before the panel sent some of Landis’ lawyers into near hysteria. The day before, John Landis had told the NTSB that after the 11:30 scene, in response to complaints from the pilot, he repositioned the helicopter in a new spot “over the river” for the final shot. Though he remembered hearing some complaints, Allingham told the investigators that", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634243667_cleaned.txt:93:9b152a9fc962", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 1697, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634243667_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634243667", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634243667_cleaned", "chunk_index": 94, "text": "received instructions like “lower, lower” over the radio.

Though he remembered hearing some complaints, Allingham told the investigators that after the 11:30 near-miss he only heard innocuous comments like, “Boy, that was a little warm,” or “Gee, I felt a little hot from that.” At first he didn’t even recall the 2:00 “rehearsal,” which Landis said he had ordered at Wingo’s request as a result of the earlier mishap. Not until Behr went off the record to refresh Allingham’s memory did the witness return to the subject of the 2:00 “non-filming shot,” as the NTSB investigators called the “rehearsal,” or DOCU/2:00, as it was marked on the film. With his memory refreshed by Behr, Allingham recalled the rehearsal being “over the water itself” – and he even remembered having been in it! Allingham, like Landis, did not hesitate to point the finger at the pilot and the explosives chief. The UPM cited his reliance on “professionalism,” hiring “what we thought were the best.” But once hired, he said, he had little contact with them, basically leaving it up to the pilot and the explosives chief to work out the type of effects that would be used. The way John Landis described it, movie making was just like any other business in which the set is like a small factory whose product is the shot. Each shot is strung together in the editing room to make the film. John Landis, as director, is the factory owner, the UPM is the key man on the line who makes sure everything is there. The 1st AD, by the same analogy, is the factory foreman, “the guy who makes it run,” as Landis put it. The 1st AD makes sure all the departments – costuming, camera, makeup, special effects – are functioning and that everything is ready on the set when, at the cue from the director, he has the privilege to shout, “Roll’em!” Or as the Hollywood transplant from Israel, Elie Cohn, shouted in thickly accented English, “Turn’ em!” Elie Cohn, whose youthful appearance belied the fact that he had fought in two Israeli wars, gave the impression of a hard, military person. He had met John Landis on the set of the 1981 Costa-Gavras film Missing, with Jack Lemmon. The film, for which Lemmon received an Academy Award, was being shot in Mexico for Universal and John Landis came to the set to visit his best friend, Universal’s Sean Daniel.

The director and Elie Cohn lunched together, and John Landis remembered Cohn when he needed a 1st AD in a pinch for his TZ segment. The addition of Cohn to the production was prompted by Warner’s dissatisfaction with Landis’ budget cutting techniques. When Warner’s Fred Gallo discovered that Allingham was cutting corners by doubling up as a first AD, in addition to his UPM duties, the top Warner executive demanded that Fly By Night comply with the studios’ labor agreements and hire a separate individual for the job. At the time of his testimony, Elie Cohn had professed a deep loyalty to the hyperkinetic director. Central to the first AD’s version of what happened that night at Indian Dunes was an effort to show that there was a consensus among the key crew members as to what was expected to happen during the crash scene. Like Landis and Allingham, as would Folsey later, Cohn mentioned the 2:00 “rehearsal” in his NTSB interview. He reiterated that the pilot knew what was happening, affirming that the director had to rely on others. Cohn held to the above-the-line version of the crash. While shooting the crucial crash scene, the 1st AD said he had two walkie-talkies, one to talk to his special assistant and the camera operators; the other to communicate with Dan Allingham in the helicopter who also had two walkie-talkies ”just in case,” Cohn explained, because one didn’t work too well on the prior shot. By now the NTSB had obtained photographs and some graphics of the set relating to the crash. When being shown a photograph showing a prominent stick that had been planted as a cueing device in the middle of the river, Cohn was asked to point out where in relation to it he saw the helicopter hovering. Cohn pointed to “the stick,” indicating that Vic Morrow was to run towards the stick while the helicopter hovered to the north of the village pier with the sampan tied to it. His understanding of the way the scene occurred had Landis positioning the helicopter “over the river,” away from the fatal fireballs on the village shoreline. The cue for the fireballs, Cohn indicated, was the machine guns opening fire from the helicopter. Elie Cohn was a more assured witness than Allingham, more consistent in detail, and in many ways a more arresting witness. Landis’ and Allingham’s accounts, for example, reflected nothing of the sheer deadly terror which Cohn said everyone", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634243667_cleaned.txt:95:209f86341273", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 1699, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634243667_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634243667", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634243667_cleaned", "chunk_index": 96, "text": "it.

Elie Cohn was a more assured witness than Allingham, more consistent in detail, and in many ways a more arresting witness. Landis’ and Allingham’s accounts, for example, reflected nothing of the sheer deadly terror which Cohn said everyone on the set felt as the helicopter came down and the entire crew thought it was going to burst into flame and kill every one of them; like Allingham, Cohn believed the helicopter went out of control after the first explosion. “The only thing that came to my mind is that the helicopter would explode, so you know I was standing over here” – he pointed to the spit of sand – “and I went over there…” The Israeli film man told the NTSB that following the 11:30 rage scene he heard from people who’d flown through the fireballs in the helicopter that they could feel the explosions. He said he could see that they were wet from the water mortar. It was very much on everybody’s mind, he noted, that the final shot was going to be bigger. “You know,” Cohn confided, referring to the lunch break following the rage scene, “people were talking at dinner. John was telling about the explosions going to be bigger.” Cohn recalled that the director was making the point to the stunt coordinator who had just been in the rocky flight. Cohn remembered the director saying, “We’re going to do it again, and explosions are going to be bigger.” Before the start of the final shooting, Cohn told Llorente, “We rehearsed the helicopter, where the helicopter would go, fly to, and the cue again, which everybody was aware of before the explosions.” He mentioned that Vic Morrow not only was fully briefed in his “motor home” by John Landis but also participated in the “rehearsal.” An unfamiliarity with the language excused the Israeli film maker from being precise or specific. It gave him the advantage of being obscure or clear-spoken when he chose, or to state two opposite conclusions simultaneously. Thus, there was and was not a bullhorn. Vic’s last performance was and was not a stunt. “There was one comment made to me,” Cohn recalled, “that everything is fine.” At the same time, he admitted, it sounded almost “foolish” not to think that it could be dangerous. Many on the NTSB panel questioning Landis’ 1st AD had already seen the footage of the crash. The Screen Actors Guild representative on the panel was curious about the identity of the man in the bright orange shirt who appeared to be racing across the screen to the bodies.

Cohn made it a minor mystery when he said he didn’t know. Adding to the mystery were certain additional discrepancies which would be later pounced on at the trial. But where it was consistent with the above-the-line version was in the finger-pointing at Paul Stewart and Dorcey Wingo. Cohn said that the explosives chief knew where the helicopter would be because of the “rehearsal,” which was also to have made the pilot aware of the position of the shot. Elie Cohn had been working for Hollywood directors for about seven years and he defended Landis’ conduct in general, seeing nothing inappropriate in the screaming, the obsession with special effects or having the kids on a dangerous set. “He was thinking about the best shot possible without, you know, definitely not injuring anybody; or not even, you know, coming close to it. “It’s done in our business,” the 1st AD concluded. “We’re working a lot of times. It’s a matter of inches. I’ve seen it a lot of times. It happened. But then, you know, the director would ask for the best thing possible. Ninety-nine percent of the time nothing happened, and unfortunately here there was an accident. The NTSB’s probe into the Twilight Zone disaster was a far from typical job. Obstacles were put in Llorente’s way not only by the Hollywood people, but as well by his superiors in Washington. He often found himself shunned and accused of “grandstanding.” Several times he received an official reprimand for exceeding his authority. On three occasions following the close of the NTSB portion of the investigation he was passed over for promotion. It was impossible to interview Frank Marshall and Llorente himself confided that if he had attempted to summon Marshall’s boss, Steven Spielberg, he would have been “crushed.” The small crushed lives of the two children haunted him, even though the children were not part of Llorente’s jurisdiction. In fact, when the movie director agreed to cooperate with the NTSB it was on the condition that they would not talk about the children. It fell to the labor commissioner’s office to answer this question, but all that agency knew was little more than that laws had been violated. The question how the children got to Indian Dunes and who hired them – the true story of their concealment on the set as the “Vietnamese” – would not become public until a year later, and then only because", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634243667_cleaned.txt:97:24bf266b5b49", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 1701, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634243667_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634243667", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634243667_cleaned", "chunk_index": 98, "text": "with the NTSB it was on the condition that they would not talk about the children.

The question how the children got to Indian Dunes and who hired them – the true story of their concealment on the set as the “Vietnamese” – would not become public until a year later, and then only because of a lucky break by deputy sheriff Tom Budds in connection with Andy House, the picture’s second assistant director, the man in the bright orange shirt that the first AD failed to remember in his testimony a few days after the disaster. In the chain of command the 2nd AD was technically responsible for the handling of the children on the set the night of the crash. Yet Andy House had been overlooked by the NTSB. It was from House that authorities, incidentally, received their first clues as to how the children had been hired without permits and effectively concealed from the teacher/welfare worker, Jack Tice, the fireman the night of the crash. Tice had first discovered that kids were in the scene when he found Myca’s head in a shallow portion of the water minutes after the disaster. When literally stumbling upon this grim discovery his initial thought was that the production people had obtained the kids from the crowd at the last moment and put them before the cameras. However, with the sheriffs coming on the scene he overheard Andy House give out the children’s names, and so Tice realized that House knew something about how the kids had been hired. Subsequently, Charlie Hughes, the labor investigator, obtained Andy House’s name from Jack Tice; Hughes recollected with characteristic saltiness, “Andy was as nervous as a whore in a church,” when he first spoke to him on the telephone within days of the accident. The second time Charlie Hughes talked to House he told the young film maker, “Look, you’ve ducked me for two days now.” Andy went straight to Warner’s lawyers. Much to his surprise, the labor investigator soon received a telephone call from John Dellaverson, a personal friend of House and a lawyer with a prominent Hollywood entertainment firm, Loeb & Loeb. Dellaverson told Hughes that Andy would tell everything he knew for a grant of immunity and a promise that the labor commissioner would not challenge his client’s ability to hire children in the future. But when Hughes took the offer to his boss, Colleen Logan, she turned it down and House declined an interview with the labor commissioner’s man.

Eventually there would be so many that by the time the DA’s office began reviewing the case it became inevitable that the grand jury would have to be used in order to place witnesses under oath to get the story straight. In the meantime, Don Llorente made public for the first time the NTSB findings that the crash had been caused by debris from the explosions striking the copter’s tail rotor blade. Other developments in the case were reported on a daily basis by the Herald Examiner’s Andy Furillo. One development that fixed the newspaper on the story was the fact that the “carrot-top cub” had tracked down an anonymous witness who contradicted the NTSB account given by John Landis as to where the helicopter was supposed to be when the explosives were set off. Quoting his secret source, Furillo reported that the plan for the fatal shot was to place the helicopter directly over the explosions. harlie Hughes and his colleagues were kept a safe distance from the studio people who might, figuratively speaking, be said to have “parented” the children of the Landis segment. In the development of the script, along with Frank Marshall, Steven Spielberg and Warner president Terry Semel, a less known name in the industry, Warner’s Lucy Fisher, had played a critical role in rescuing the director’s unusable written efforts. A young attractive Harvard graduate, Lucy Fisher was “instrumental,” according to one of Warner’s internal communications, in incorporating the children into the final Landis script. At the time the Spielberg project went into production she had been about a year at Warner, a VP and senior production executive chiefly involved on the creative side in pre-production stages; typically in story development. Before that she helped Francis Ford Coppola run his floundering Zoetrope Studios, becoming at age 32 a production chief and, apart from Sherry Lansing over at Twentieth Century Fox, probably the most powerful woman in Hollywood at the time. An insider eulogizing Zoetrope’s 1981 demise suggested that Coppola was only a “figurehead” and that it was really Lucy who had been running the studio. Taking her fourth studio executive job in three years, according to a Warner memo, “Lucy Fisher was hired on a recommendation from Steven Spielberg”; she was put on the TZ movie because of her special rapport with Hollywood’s leading director.

Lucy Fisher was one of the first women in Hollywood to break the male-only barrier in the executive suite. Descended of the Fisher Brothers Steel Corporation, she came from East Coast steel and mortgage banking money. She set out for Hollywood with a Cum Laude degree from Harvard, eventually joining there the young colony of Harvard alumni, the brightest and the most amusing, who would soon launch the new post-Vietnam humor trend in film making. The chief writer of National Lampoon’s Animal House was Lucy’s closest friend, the tragic Doug Kinney, who committed suicide in 1981. Although best known to the public as “Stork” in Animal House, and lesser known as the film’s originator, Harvard man Kinney had already pocketed $3 million before joining Lucy Fisher in Hollywood after selling out his share in the National Lampoon magazine, whose first issue he had helped publish in 1970. Lucy Fisher’s rise in the motion picture industry was itself a phenomenon. From writing book jacket copy for a stodgy New York publisher, Prentice-Hall, she landed a far more exciting job on the West Coast, reading scripts for United Artists. After a series of breezy promotions in the script and story areas of motion picture production – the creative side – she was appointed vice president at 20th Century Fox by Alan Ladd, “Laddie,” Jr., the head of the studio, whose string of serious films about women, including Julia, An Unmarried Woman and Norma Rae, attracted Fisher, who thought of it as the least sexist studio. She felt that Laddie was “liberated.” Already by the time she had joined Coppola at Zoetrope, Lucy Fisher was hailed by the cognoscenti as an example of the changing Hollywood power elite. Her place in the upper corporate echelons was treated as a society event with her appearance in a photo spread in a Town and Country magazine feature article called, “The Lady Moguls of Hollywood.” In the spring of ‘82, Warner harnessed these credentials of power, brains and connections to Spielberg’s Twilight Zone movie. In a way it was a test. Lucy Fisher’s most important assignment was a pressure-cooker – the studio wanted the TZ movie released by Christmas in order to ride the golden wake of E.T. and Poltergeist.

The new female vice president was expected to exert creative supervision over a movie with a release date requiring breakneck production activity. In a very real sense, it was Lucy Fisher who, along with Spielberg and Warner President Terry Semel, controlled the initial pre-production phase of the Landis segment. The first of the three phases of a movie’s development, followed by production, which means the actual shooting of the film itself, and post-production, the editing and mixing of sound for the film, the pre-production phase, because it shapes the film’s eventual outcome, is thought by many the most important. In pre-production the film’s chief elements are generally established: the stars, the director, locations, setting, costume, budget and, foremost, the script, which tells the film’s basic story. Fisher’s involvement as the studio’s creative watchdog over the TZ project meant attending numerous meetings with everybody involved in the film, ranging from Jim Miller, Warner’s business affairs chief, to Frank Marshall, John Landis and George Folsey Jr. Most of her meetings, however, were with John Landis, Frank Marshall and Warner’s new president, Terry Semel, successor to Frank Wells, the Rhodes scholar and Stanford law school graduate who had come to Warner’s presidency from Gang, Tyre & Brown (Hollywood attorneys to the stars, eventually to represent Steven Spielberg in the Twilight Zone case). In the studio hierarchy, Fisher reported directly to President Semel. Many of the meetings Lucy attended with the production brass were highly charged and acrimonious, especially those that included both Warner’s Fred Gallo and the Landis people, namely George Folsey Jr. and Dan Allingham. Gallo had come to Warner from being one of the most famous and respected 1st ADs in the business on the Godfather, as well as on a string of Woody Allen movies. As Warner’s world-wide production chief, Gallo held the business reins over the TZ production, working on day-today operations. Consequently, the fundamental cause of the conflict between Gallo and Landis was the desire by the studio to control the film’s day-to-day production activities, while the director’s people sought to be fiercely independent from the studio. At the earliest of these meetings the format of the film had been worked out and also how all three parties, Landis, Spielberg, and Warner, should work together. For example, although Landis had final cut on his segment, Spielberg had final cut on his own segment, as well as on the two segments other than Landis’. Nevertheless, some details still needed to be worked out and it was in this role that Lucy Fisher dealt most intimately with John Landis – a job complicated by the fact that she dealt not with Landis in", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634243667_cleaned.txt:101:29255df5473f", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 1705, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634243667_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634243667", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634243667_cleaned", "chunk_index": 102, "text": "out and also how all three parties, Landis, Spielberg, and Warner, should work together.

Nevertheless, some details still needed to be worked out and it was in this role that Lucy Fisher dealt most intimately with John Landis – a job complicated by the fact that she dealt not with Landis in his single capacity as director, but also in his auteur character as writer and in his persona as producer. As writer for the other three segments Spielberg had hired Richard Matheson, one of the last survivors of the original nucleus of writers that included Rod Serling who wrote the original Twilight Zone, which made its television debut in October 1959. After reading the first script Landis submitted on April 15, 1982, Lucy Fisher came away feeling that the portrayal of the protagonist as a hateful and coarse drunken character was offensive to the viewers. She recommended that “Bill” be made human by giving him some socially redeeming qualities. Though there were already some children in the Nazi sequence of the script, their antagonistic relationship to Bill in an unedifying apartment scene was hardly calculated to bring the lacking element of human feeling to the story. Their relationship with Bill had nothing in it with which the audience could identify. “Warner Bros.,” Folsey remembers, “wanted to soften the character Bill.” The problem with the first script’s main character was apparent in the opening sequence in the bar. The character was too violent. Landis’ shrill portrayal of Bill as racist and his vitriolic anti-semitic remarks were too much for Fisher, Spielberg and the studio brass. Bill complains that “gas costs so much ‘cause some Jew wants more money,” and, “Too bad you can’t just shoot Goldman.” Bill says, “Jew lawyer going to put me in jail,” and states that because of the Jews, “This country is doomed.” There were also Bill’s sexist remarks to the cocktail waitress: at one point, Bill calls her a “sperm bank,” and after she serves him a beer he tells his friends Ray and Larry, “I’m so horny the crack of dawn looks good to me.” The studio people found many other defects in this first draft of the unfledged auteur. The generous use of racial epithets was not reserved for Jews alone; vicious remarks about blacks and Asians were equally rampant. But apart from the crude portrayal of character, Lucy Fisher was particularly troubled by the story’s ending. In Landis’ first draft the Vietnamese sequence was very small. Following similar brushes with Nazis and Ku Klux Klanners, Bill undergoes his final transformation from bigot to victim in a Vietnam jungle swamp amid the “sound of helicopters” and “tremendous explosions.” To keep within the low budget, the", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634243667_cleaned.txt:102:fd7e9795c8b9", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 1706, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634243667_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634243667", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634243667_cleaned", "chunk_index": 103, "text": "was not reserved for Jews alone; vicious remarks about blacks and Asians were equally rampant.

Following similar brushes with Nazis and Ku Klux Klanners, Bill undergoes his final transformation from bigot to victim in a Vietnam jungle swamp amid the “sound of helicopters” and “tremendous explosions.” To keep within the low budget, the Vietnamese swamp scene was to be done with the least amount of money possible by using the old-fashioned techniques of Jungle Sam Katzman, the maker of all the Jungle Jim movies. By simply using the right camera angles and a few palm trees, Katzman was able to make a confined area look like an elaborate jungle set. In Landis’ first draft there was no village and the only reference to a helicopter – ”the sound of helicopters” – indicated that sound effects alone were to be used to create the illusion of a real chopper in the scene. Landis’ original draft ended with American GIs opening fire on Bill, mistaking him in the swamp for Charlie. The GIs chase Bill as he runs into the swamp, at which point the film flashes back to the scene with Bill and the Klan. Then, again, still running, Bill escapes to a wooden shed. As he huddles in a corner of the shed, the Klansmen with axes “start chopping down the door” and as the door shatters, in yet another flashback, Nazi soldiers grab Bill and next he’s back in a Nazi railroad yard; the German soldiers throw him into a freight car and as the train pulls out Bill sees his drinking buddies, Larry and Ray, smiling as they exit the bar. In scene 29, the segment’s last, with his arm reaching through the slots of the departing freight car, Bill screams: “Help me, help me!” and the Landis segment ends. Shortly after discussing his first draft at a meeting in Lucy Fisher’s office at Warner, Landis agreed to rewrite the script with some of Fisher’s criticisms in mind. In the second draft Bill was softened in the film’s opening bar sequence by eliminating many of the most virulent anti-semitic remarks and completely removing Bill’s derogatory references to women. A black patron was thrown into the bar scene for no apparent reason and Landis beefed up the final Vietnam sequence with greater emphasis on special effects, adding to Scene 25 in upper case, TREMENDOUS EX-PLOSIONS. For the first time an actual helicopter appears in the story with a “blinding light… tremendous winds”-”Bill looks up in terror as a HUEY HELICOPTER descends on him…” The Vietnam sequence in this draft ends with Bill fleeing while the helicopter “hovers overhead.” After reading Landis’ second version Lucy Fisher was still not satisfied.

The explosives and the helicopter did not make Bill’s character any less offensive to the audience. There were still some distasteful racial epithets in both the bar and the apartment scene, as well as in the Nazi sequence in which the French children shout, “Juif! Juif! Juif! Juif!” at Bill. The second draft also had a new ending that didn’t make Bill’s character any more sympathetic; instead of closing with the departing train, it ends with Bill’s return to the bar scene, showing Ray and Larry helping their freaked buddy to his car” as the CAMERA pans up to see a 747 roar across the sky.” With the deadline near on the weekend of June 12, 1982, another critical script meeting was held at Warner president Terry Semel’s home with John Landis and Lucy Fisher attending. Ideas were tossed in the air and Fisher, according to one of Warner’s internal memos, feeling that Bill still did not inspire sympathy at any point, suggested the use of children in the final scenes. She felt that the bigot’s relationship with the children supplied the missing element, according to Warner’s dossier on the case. Landis and Semel agreed that the children solved the problem. In the season of E.T. and Poltergeist, when Spielberg’s own film children romped across America’s movie screens, Lucy’s idea seemed to fit the winning formula. The next day John Landis sat down to write a third draft. He softened the apartment scene in the Nazi sequence by eliminating the dialogue where the French children scream “Juif!” as Bill flees. The most dramatic change in the script, however, was a series of scenes he added to the Vietnam sequence, considerably enlarging it to include a deserted village with “thatched buildings, maybe nine or ten of them,” in which Bill finds himself with two abandoned Vietnamese children and where, following failed attempts to communicate with the boy and girl, an American helicopter “appears from over the cliff and hovers over the village.” Mistaking Bill for the enemy the chopper opens fire as “he grabs the kids and runs for cover.” At this point he makes the “herculean” effort, carrying a child under each arm while crossing the river with the helicopter hovering over the village as “one after another the buildings blow up in flames.” The new exploding village scene even made specific reference – ”one of the huts EXPLODES in a spectacular fireball”", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634243667_cleaned.txt:104:19574a29d919", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 1708, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634243667_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634243667", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634243667_cleaned", "chunk_index": 105, "text": "over the cliff and hovers over the village.” Mistaking Bill for the enemy the chopper opens fire as “he grabs the kids and runs for cover.” At this point he makes the “herculean” effort, carrying a child under each arm while crossing the river with the helicopter hovering over the village as “one after another the buildings blow up in flames.” The new exploding village scene even made specific reference – ”one of the huts EXPLODES in a spectacular fireball” – to a particular special effect which explodes while the helicopter is “over the village” as it gives chase and “Bill runs as best he can across the river.” The third draft contained nearly all the elements to be staged on the night of the fatal filming, chiefly the exploding village scene. But there were still some small problems. The opening bar scenes still seemed too harsh. The minor incident in the bar which introduces the black patron seemed gratuitous. It made no sense. And even the newly added exploding village scene with Bill and the children did not seem to make the main character any more likable. Neither did the third draft’s slightly altered ending seem to help; as in the previous two drafts, Bill was again transported back to the bar scene where, outside the bar, he’s hit by a truck and “pinned under its rear tire,” while again a 747 roars overhead. Bill then utters the segment’s closing lines: The shooting script used on the set the night of the crash was the fourth and final draft. It was completed on June 22, just weeks before filming commenced. Some disagreement still existed over the coarseness of the bar scenes but, having already compromised in the preceding drafts Landis was able to argue that the main character had to be viewed as despicable by the audience in order to make his redemption “work” in the segment’s final rescue scenes. In the final draft Landis prevailed in generally preserving the bar scene the way he had originally conceived it, softening only Bill’s reference to the black patron in the bar from “coon” to “black guy.” The only significant change in the script’s fourth draft concerned the scene in the village where Bill tries hopelessly to communicate with the kids, as well as a slight modification in the segment’s ending. With the apparent object to add some emotion to Bill’s relationship with the children, the final script calls for the little girl to hand Bill “a broken and naked Barbie Doll” just before the village explodes and the helicopter chase begins: With the addition of this new (and inexpensive) prop, Landis was able to give a new twist to the ending. As in the third draft the segment ends with Bill being transported back to the street scene outside the bar. This time, however, he is “clipped by a car", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634243667_cleaned.txt:105:ade948d2ab97", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 1709, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634243667_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634243667", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634243667_cleaned", "chunk_index": 106, "text": "relationship with the children, the final script calls for the little girl to hand Bill “a broken and naked Barbie Doll” just before the village explodes and the helicopter chase begins: With the addition of this new (and inexpensive) prop, Landis was able to give a new twist to the ending.

This time, however, he is “clipped by a car and thrown violently to the curb” with the barbie doll in his hand. In an apparent sop to Bill’s racial conflicts, the final script has the bar’s black patron follow Bill’s friends, Ray and Larry, as they rush from the bar to Bill’s aid. Landis’ script revisions were approved by the studio, but Lucy Fisher, apparently, had one more reservation: she specifically asked Frank Marshall and John Landis whether using the children at night would be a “problem.” According to a memo generated by Warner’s own internal investigation of the crash, both men told her not to worry about it. With fresh revisions of the script approved by the studio, Lucy Fisher’s official role in the production came to an end. The script’s addition of Bill’s new scenes raised the Landis budget request, already at $1 million, by approximately $300, 000 , mainly to pay for the Vietnam village construction. After haggling with Landis over $100, 000 -or-so, the studio came back with a $200, 000 offer, permitting set designer Richard Sawyer to begin building the huts on the river. By June 25, 1982, one month before the crash, sketches of the proposed village and storyboards showing some of the exploding village scenes had been submitted by Richard Sawyer to the director. With a tight budget that was already bursting at the seams, John Landis had just under four weeks to build a jungle village. Dissatisfied with the accounts of the above-the-line witnesses, Llorente and his team next talked to the drivers, camera opera-tors, electricians, stunt people, special effects men – all the hands that had worked to translate the Twilight Zone illusion to the screen. A good third of the 100-or-so crew members from the set that night eventually appeared before the NTSB panel and it was largely from these belowthe-line versions that Llorente was able to get a clearer picture of what had gone wrong at Indian Dunes. His most shocking findings concerned the performance of the SFX crew. The powder truck was said to have been a bar on wheels, stocking black powder bombs along with vodka and beer. The powdermen that night on the set presented a scary picture as some with drink in hand conducted the delicate business of setting and firing explosives.

Throughout the filming that night special effects truck driver Carl Pittman, by his own admission, ran the booze-express between the special effects crew and the nearest liquor store. The prop truck also had a cooler with sodas and beer. Special effects chief Paul Stewart was seen holding a drink as he supervised the wiring and firing before the fatal shot. The set hairdresser saw him sip what she thought was vodka and orange juice. Although he was never discovered by deputy sheriff Budds or any of the other investigators, a second witness to the free-flowing alcohol on the set expressed the belief that John Landis knew about the drinking but tolerated it because it made the powder chief more compliant. John Landis’ own private investigation turned up a third key witness who claimed he had seen Stewart drunk that night. Just before the crash Stewart and fellow powderman Jerry Williams, according to this account, were reported drinking beer together by the powder truck near the Chapman crane, practically under the director’s nose. A fourth witness said the drinking continued even after the crash while the powdermen frantically loaded the wires, detonators and all the rest of the explosives gear onto a pick-up. From the pick-up they transferred the equipment to the larger powder truck driven by Carl Pittman who was so affected by the alcohol he had consumed on the set that, driving his 10-ton rig back to The Burbank Studios, as a fifth witness described it, he “wigwagged all the way home.” A sixth witness who also believed Stewart was drinking on the set told Landis’ private eye that he felt Landis knew about the drinking. Like master shot cameraman Steve Lydecker and associate producer George Folsey Jr., Paul Stewart had Hollywood roots. His father worked for Warner Bros., for much of his life. His brother also had a job in the industry. But Stewart, who was in his early fifties, did not belong to the top rank of Hollywood’s SFX establishment. Stewart had SFX credits on movies like White Mama; Won Ton Ton, The Dog that Saved Hollywood; The Last Hard Man; The Wrecking Crew, and Soggy Bottom, USA. He had only worked on a few up-scale productions like Cimino’s $40 -million epic disaster Heaven’s Gate.

Wenger fell through when at the production office Landis recognized in the applicant the person who on the Blues Brothers set had been difficult about the safety of one of the movie’s big explosion scenes. “You’re the son-of-a-bitch that cost me all that money,” the bearded young director sneered at Wenger as he completed his interview with Allingham at the Universal bungalow. Allingham never called Wenger back. Ultimately, Paul Stewart owed his job on the TZ segment through the circumstance that John Landis was a great fan of B-movies. At the time of his meeting with Stewart the director had just been to see The Exterminator in a raunchy theatre on Hollywood Boulevard. Landis especially loved the film’s special effects. Dan Allingham who, after Wenger’s abrupt dismissal, brought Stewart in to see Landis mentioned that Paul Stewart was responsible for the pyrotechnics in that movie. That same day Stewart was hired. Like his helicopter bargain, Allingham got a good deal. Stewart charged a very reasonable $25 an hour and agreed to assemble the rest of the crew at even lower wages. Stewart had no trouble assembling a crew. He was friends with Jerry Williams, James Camomile and Harry Stewart; Kevin Quibell was new to SFX. They were all rough tough macho types, whiskered and tattooed, in uniform T-shirt and baggy jeans, except for Jimmy Camomile. Trim and clean-cut, he was a former Navy man with a frank, open gaze. Witnesses said he had not been drinking on the set at Indian Dunes. Along with the stuntmen, the special effects men, who referred to each other as “powdermen,” formed a Hollywood sub-caste and were not socially acceptable in the higher circles on the set. Privately, Landis referred to them as “hillbillies.” The “hillbillies” formed a small tight-knit world, socially, professionally, even geographically. The powdermen on the Landis segment all lived in the northern San Fernando Valley near the foothills where many of the old Hollywood westerns were once shot. Although most of Hollywood was experiencing an economic depression in the spring of 1982, these were boom times for the types of film that employed powdermen. In the new Hollywood, box-office success was identified with special effects. A new type of audience, less concerned with drama on the screen, wanted to see movies with spectacular stunts and special effects like Towering Inferno, Jaws, Close Encounters and Poltergeist.

Paul Stewart had worked together on other sets with almost everybody on the crew he assembled for the Landis segment. Harry Stewart and Jerry Williams had also teamed up before, notably on The Border, with Jack Nicholson, directed by Tony Richardson; Jim Camomile and Paul Stewart worked together on Heaven’s Gate and on Soggy Bottom, USA. All three had recently worked together on The Exterminator. Of the five-man SFX crew only Paul Stewart, Harry Stewart and Jimmy Camomile held the “A” powder card that allowed them to perform explosive pyrotechnics without direct supervision on Hollywood locations. Jerry Williams with a B-card, and SFX newcomer Kevin Quibell, could only work under Stewart’s and Camomile’s direct supervision. Days before the filming of the final scenes at Indian Dunes, Paul Stewart visited the site with Landis, Folsey and Elie Cohn, along with the director of photography (DP) Steve Larner and set designer Richard Sawyer. Sawyer had sketches of the village and with their aid they tried to imagine the scene when Bill goes in among the huts to rescue the children. The film people looked out from the spit of sand in the middle of the river. They talked about camera positions as they reconnoitered and Landis explained how he wanted his shot. Stewart was to gather from the director’s indications what kinds of mortars he would need-round or square; 12, 18, or 24-in.; what quantities of gasoline to have on hand; where to dig the holes to position the mortars for each scene, and finally, the size of the explosive charges which he needed to custom-order. On the Monday of the last shooting week, three days before they were actually needed, the heavy metal pots were brought out to the set by Jerry Williams and Kevin Quibell. The two powdermen dug several holes at the back side of the cliff for the heavy mortars that would launch the fireballs. They left their remaining supplies and equipment near the village where they knew they’d be filming. This left the final placement and planting of the mortars and bombs to the last minute. The special effects to be used in the final shot was far from the expensive variety favored by movie makers like Spielberg and Lucas in the new box-office blockbusters.

The movie set at Indian Dunes that night employed the cheapest methods to satisfy the needs of the tight budget. The stylish movie lab where computers and lasers bloodlessly achieve their visual spectaculars was a world away from the burly powdermen in T-shirts that night with their sloshing buckets of gasoline, the fumes of which engulfed the set, sickening people and adding to the jitters. To achieve their mighty fireballs in the village, the powdermen filled the various mortars with up to 15 gallons of gasoline, pouring it over the fist-sized black powder bombs that had been taped round with electrical tape and dipped in shellac to enhance their explosive power. Placed at the bottom of each pot, the black powder bombs were then wired to their respective firing boards. These reasonably inexpensive fireballs – costing about $18 each for the 8-oz. black powder bombs plus the cost of gasoline – represented Hollywood’s preferred way to create the appearance of battle on movie sets. Combined with sawdust and gasoline, a black powder bomb packed in a heavy steel pot could launch a fireball between 100- 200 feet into the air. Unlike “high” explosives such as dynamite, which does not show up well on film, black powder bombs are “low” explosives, burning more slowly on combustion, making them more visually impressive on screen. That night the bombs, which ran 4 and 8-oz., were stored in powder magazines built into the 10-ton SFX truck. The truck used that night was one of the fleet of powder wagons at The Burbank Studios. It was driven to the set by Carl Pittman, the same man who ran the shuttle between the SFX crew in Indian Dunes and the nearest liquor store. With the exception of Dan Allingham, none of the crew on the final night was as busy as the powdermen. After the 11:30 rage scene they were rushed a “little bit of lunch” from the caterers which they gulped down, and though they were paid a little extra for working through the break, they would have rather joined the rest of the crew down the road at the lunch wagons and taken a breather from the hectic pace set by the director. To Paul Stewart, it seemed, John Landis constantly wanted more – more explosives inside the huts, more squibs in the water, more mortar pots, more shots on the shotboard, more fireballs. As a result, the powdermen never left the village and continued rigging right up to the fatal scene while their chief tried, unsuccessfully for the most part, to keep the director from still adding to their job.

As a result, the powdermen never left the village and continued rigging right up to the fatal scene while their chief tried, unsuccessfully for the most part, to keep the director from still adding to their job. Stewart was able only in a few instances to resist the director, notably once when for the final shot John Landis asked him to set up additional electrical squibs to simulate more machine gun fire from the attacking helicopter. Stewart objected that with any more wiring in the river Vic and the kids might not make it across without tripping. This time, heeding Stewart’s request, Landis agreed to a rare compromise: instead of planting the river with more squibs, he was persuaded by Stewart to use the powerful air guns that ripped the water like bullet hits, though only shooting marbles. Stewart’s first SFX action on the final night of shooting came at 9:30. There were only a few “effects” and the chief one – the explosion of a hut from which Vic Morrow has just picked up the children to begin the rescue sequence – was cued by the director. The exploding hut in this shot represented a rocket “hit” from the helicopter just as Vic Morrow makes his way out of the hut with the kids under his arms, heading to the shoreline to begin his escape across the river. The hut explosions were set off even while the actor and the children were dangerously close in the scene frame with them, that is, within 10-15 feet of the bursting black powder bombs. The next shot, the 11:30 rage scene, was more complicated, requiring more special effects and a tricky performance by the helicopter. At 9:30 the helicopter had not been visible in the shot, performing only as a special effects platform with its spotlight illuminating the hut as well as creating a wind effect on the village from its main rotor blade. However, at 11:30 the helicopter was most prominently visible since it was the “establishing shot” to be shown in the actual film immediately preceding the 9:30 rescue shot. It was shot in reverse order at 11:30 because, as the helicopter had to be brought in low, some propwash damage was expected to be done to the set and, in contrast to the earlier 9:30 scene, which was a close-up shot of the village set, at 2:20 it would no longer matter how the set looked since it would be blown up anyway. With the helicopter hovering over the village, the 11:30 shot required three fireball explosions in the village; the single SFX explosion in the water used a water mortar", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634243667_cleaned.txt:111:cf12e458f2aa", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 1715, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634243667_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634243667", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634243667_cleaned", "chunk_index": 112, "text": "had to be brought in low, some propwash damage was expected to be done to the set and, in contrast to the earlier 9:30 scene, which was a close-up shot of the village set, at 2:20 it would no longer matter how the set looked since it would be blown up anyway. With the helicopter hovering over the village, the 11:30 shot required three fireball explosions in the village; the single SFX explosion in the water used a water mortar which instead of a fireball sends up a powerful spume of water. Like the fireballs in the village, the explosion in the water gave the appearance on screen of a rocket hitting near Vic. The scene also called for a shower of bullet hits to be simulated by squibs which, like the mortars, were hooked up to special effects striking boards. The striking boards were primitive contraptions powered by batteries. The charge was achieved by “striking” a strip of brass on them with a nail. The boards had many such strips and each was connected by a wire to an explosive charge. One of the A-card powdermen, Jimmy Camomile, had set off the two explosions that blew up the hut at 9:30. Again at 11:30 Camomile closely followed the director’s instructions as relayed to him by Stewart. For Vic’s rage scene three fireball explosions in the village were planted in the back row of huts; they would appear on-screen as rocket hits immediately to the right and left of the hut where Vic Morrow has stashed the kids. This was the opening shot in the sequence in which Vic, the SFX fireballs and the helicopter are all in the same frame, “establishing” the geographical relationship between these elements in the viewer’s mind. Camomile listened attentively to the powder chief as the 11:30 scene approached. Feeling great loyalty to Stewart, who was a few years older, he followed his chief ’s orders that night, even when he felt he might be doing something that could pose a possible conflict with the principles of Title 19, the California state law which defined the legal obligations of the powderman. On one such occasion, as Camomile prepared the water explosion just before the 11:30 shot, he was already warning Stewart of his concern about potential hazards to the aircraft in the rage scene – ”the helicopter might be a little low or get wet, or something like that.” Stewart ignored his warning and went ahead with the water explosion which at 11:30 was to surprise Dorcey Wingo by sending a sheet of blinding mud and water across his windshield.

James Camomile’s account of his early warnings was one of those incriminating admissions made in the aftermath of the crash to which the attorneys for the special effects crew alone were privy; for out of loyalty to his boss, Camomile never repeated this confidence to either the NTSB or at the trial. Plans concerning the location of most of the mortars had been made days before the crash and conveyed to the chief at the LA fire department’s Hollywood wing, DeWitt Morgan. Morgan relied on Paul Stewart to give him accurate information about the placement of the explosives and before issuing the permit for the shoot he had been informed that the mortars and black powder bombs in the final explosive scene would be placed only outside and around the huts. The fire inspector was given specific assurances by Stewart that there would not be any explosives under any structures. The danger from debris would be further minimized, Stewart told Morgan, as the huts would not be involved in the explosion. Based on that information, the fireman granted a permit that allowed giant gasoline explosions to send fireballs 150 feet in the air. In his last talk on location with Stewart while visiting the set on the night before the crash the fire inspector learned nothing new about the special effects plan. Stewart appeared to be sticking to the original plan, which Morgan had already approved. Once at the location, Morgan didn’t even cross the river and look into the village, having no reason to doubt the powder chief ’s word that no bombs would be put under any of the structures. The fire inspector didn’t return the following night to watch the spectacular finale. Had he done so he would have been surprised to see the helicopter hover over the village during the explosions, since he had never been told that was in the plan either. The supervising fire safety officer the night of the crash was George Hull, a retired LA county fireman like the five other FSOs on the set. Coincidentally, Hull had a background in the department’s helicopter unit. He had been supervising sets for 30 years and had witnessed SFX explosives and helicopter stunts on many, many film locations. Having met with Morgan and the show’s SFX supervisor on several occasions Hull knew what to expect during the filming that night.

Having met with Morgan and the show’s SFX supervisor on several occasions Hull knew what to expect during the filming that night. But for all his wealth of experience Hull was effectively removed from his role as a safety supervisor on the set by the time of the 11:30 shot; or, rather, he had removed himself by voluntarily locating himself 90 ft. up on the cliff in order to avoid confronting “the most irrational human being” he had ever been around. The old-timer was intimidated by the long-bearded, shaggy-haired hyper young director whose appearance struck him as “very hippy and greasy that night.” Hull was a straight, conservative fireman. He had never met someone who would be “cussing someone out” one moment and “telling jokes” the next. Hull was proud of his Hollywood duties and though selected by the fire department and not the movie company, he didn’t see any point in making waves. He thought it was better to distance himself high up on the cliff far from the “most irrational human being” and ignore the thinly disguised drinking he had seen on the set. Even though the highest visible point of the explosions on the screen would be 40 feet above the village base, the fireballs were expected to cause fire hazards over 100 feet above; up on the cliff Hull joined three FSOs already there, leaving only Jack Tice and Jack Rimmer below. Initially, following the nearly fatal 11:30 shot there had been some concern among the firemen about the possibility that the helicopter was flying too close to the explosions. But Tice on the ground assured Hull up on the cliff that the pilot was aware of the problem and would adjust his position by flying further away from the village explosions in the next shot. But in actuality, with the firemen, including the top-ranking fire official out of the way, John Landis and Paul Stewart had a virtual free hand in arranging the final exploding village scene the way they wanted. While the rest of the crew broke for a midnight lunch at the mobile canteen up the road, John Landis remained briefly in the village with Stewart and the other SFX men, walking the set and telling them what he wanted in the shot. It was easy to see that the SFX crew worked furiously during the nearly three hours between the rage scene and the final call. After 11:30 nearly everyone on the set was aware that bigger explosions were yet to come. At first the director wanted special effects bombs inside both rows of huts, the seven in the back as well as the four in the", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634243667_cleaned.txt:114:e6c9d308fce1", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 1718, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634243667_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634243667", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634243667_cleaned", "chunk_index": 115, "text": "other SFX men, walking the set and telling them what he wanted in the shot. It was easy to see that the SFX crew worked furiously during the nearly three hours between the rage scene and the final call. After 11:30 nearly everyone on the set was aware that bigger explosions were yet to come. At first the director wanted special effects bombs inside both rows of huts, the seven in the back as well as the four in the front row – the huts closest to the action. Stewart explained that because of the way the huts in the back row were constructed against the cliff, placing gasoline mortars inside them would create enormous explosive power due to the concentration of fumes. Stewart declined putting the bombs there. But the director’s objectives with regard to the shoreline huts presented a lesser problem. In Stewart’s mind they seemed less dangerous because of their open construction. The director pointed to these huts where eventually, according to later evidence, Stewart’s men violated the conditions of their permit by planting mortars inside or underneath three of the four front row structures. For despite all the grumbling, the drama of the 11:30 shot had given the director exciting proof of further cinematic possibilities. So, it was not only in terms of new locations that he changed the plan which Stewart had conveyed to DeWitt Morgan while applying for the permit. Landis was seen by witnesses as never letting up on Stewart that night to make the explosions themselves bigger. Even after the near catastrophe at 11:30, he continued pressing Stewart, screaming at the chief of SFX, related one witness, that for the big finale scene he wanted nothing less than “a wall of fire.” Key legal documents from the powder chief ’s early defense team indicated that while Landis harangued him to “step up” the size of some of the explosions in several shoreline huts, the lawyers believed that Stewart may have been highly vulnerable to this kind of intimidation because he and his SFX crew were drinking at the time. A similar story, an unusually frank communication, circulated among certain members of the director’s own law team. It implied that Landis’ pattern of screaming at Stewart after the 11:30 shot prompted the powder chief to grumble to his men that he would show the director a thing or two about big explosions. The powder chief continued to grumble after the director left the village and crossed the river over to where the mobile kitchen was set up. The confidential story went on to say how Stewart griped to his friend Jerry Williams about Landis’ “attitude” – he didn’t like it, nor did he like “a lot of the things that were happening” – and neither was he “thrilled” with what Landis was looking for in the upcoming shot.

To Williams he was reported to have mentioned an incident earlier in the evening when the director had asked him to place a mortar under one of the shoreline huts, and Stewart said that he hadn’t wanted to do it. Outside of the SFX crew, set designer Richard Sawyer was one of the few to actually witness firsthand the interactions among the people who plotted the explosions in the village that night. Sawyer knew Jerry Williams from working with him on the set of The Border. Following the 11:30 rage scene he stood next to Williams and watched the rough-tough type with the potbelly and wild hair sort out the electrical lines that traveled far into the river, disappearing into the muddy village shoreline. As the set designer looked on, Williams told the delicate art school graduate that he could rely on his memory to remember where each of the wires led and that he would fire them off in a memorized pre-arranged sequence. But to Sawyer’s amazement and dismay he heard Williams mention just as casually that during the just completed rage scene he hadn’t even seen the mammoth fireballs. Keeping his eyes fixed on Vic to ensure that the actor was a safe distance away from the explosions in the scene, Williams said he hadn’t been looking up to watch the fireballs’ proximity to the helicopter. Although Sawyer made no secret of his dislike for the giant powderman, the set designer never told his full story to authorities. By the set designer’s account, Williams’ haphazard procedure showed an unusual departure from conventional film-making practices. Ordinarily, the SFX crew would work from a diagram called the “plot plan.” In fact, in the days just before the final night’s shooting, Stewart had dispatched his crew to the location with a backhoe tractor to make the holes that were to house the exploding mortars. Sawyer remembered giving Stewart a bare drawing of the village which he assumed Stewart would use as a blueprint to map out the planned locations of the explosives on the set. Director of photography Steve Larner, too, remembered seeing such a blueprint. Typically, however, like most of the artists’ renderings and visual representations of the set that night – sketches, drawings, blueprints, notes – a special effects plot plan for the fatal scene was never found.

By the time the final shot was set to go, the five-man special effects crew proved insufficient. Just before the 2:20 crash Paul Stewart was so short-handed that he had Jerry Williams recruit two inexperienced draftees from other jobs; Mike Milgrom, the propman, and Mike Berdrow who drove the special effects water truck, to be marble gunners. While the last of the mortars were being loaded and the squibs were being placed in the water to line the trail traveled by Vic and the kids in their climactic scene, Williams hastily explained to the new recruits to aim the marble guns just in front of Vic and the kids to simulate machine gun fire from the helicopter “during the action.” Naturally, as novices, they were told to be careful not to hit Vic with the powerful marbles. A famous Hollywood director who returns the call from a mere standin is highly unusual, but John Landis did, and rather quickly. They had a short conversation. At the end of it, Liddle was asked if he would be willing to talk to Landis’ lawyer. “Sure, I’ll talk.” In the expectation of battles down the road, the movie director’s legal phalanx was busy lining up friendly witnesses. Bob Liddle eventually was to receive a call from Landis’ private eye. Though Liddle was still being sent out at meager rates by Central Casting and John Landis was a $1 million-a-movie superstar, the stand-in was remarkably free from envy. He had been an extra player on Kentucky Fried Movie and admired Landis as a self-made director who had achieved greatness in the industry. But in the aftermath of the Twilight Zone crash, not all his goodwill, admiration and friendly feelings could keep Bob Liddle from feeling disturbed. He had been shocked by the filming of a scene involving Vic Morrow as he dives into the water with pursuing Viet Cong firing into a banana plant nearby; hearing Landis call in real shotguns using live ammo for a better effect, Liddle walked away in a hurry before the bullets flew. On the fatal night the stand-in witnessed another incident that disturbed him. It occurred during a brief rehearsal just prior to the 9:30 rescue sequence. Liddle watched Vic Morrow grab the kids and, in a short run-by, drop Myca into the water. The little boy got wet and cried. Andy House saw it, too. Later, during the actual shot, Liddle felt that the kids were “shocked at all the noise and stuff.”", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634243667_cleaned.txt:117:0acd53b399eb", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 1721, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634243667_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634243667", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634243667_cleaned", "chunk_index": 118, "text": "away in a hurry before the bullets flew.

Later, during the actual shot, Liddle felt that the kids were “shocked at all the noise and stuff.” In fact, because of Myca’s fall in the earlier run-by, Liddle and House assisted during the actual take a few minutes later: at the water’s edge Liddle stood to the actor’s left, Andy House stood to the right of Vic, and they took the kids from Vic’s arms as he ran out of the frame in the 9:30 take. Liddle briefly held Renee who was crying from sand that had blown in her eye from the propwash before handing her to one of the “oriental” people on the shore. The little girl’s mother was also worried after seeing all the commotion caused by the helicopter and the explosions. In her broken English, Mrs. Chen asked Folsey nervously, “Are you sure it’s not dangerous?” Putting his arm around her shoulder, Folsey assured her that there was no danger, “only noise.” Folsey quickly took her back to the trailer. Later that night during the so-called 2:00 a.m. “rehearsal,” Liddle, who was never interviewed by sheriff ’s investigators, walked the path in the water which Vic would walk during the actual filming. The helicopter was brought in and its powerful spotlight fixed on Liddle at the same spot Vic would be in 20 minutes later. The stand-in was about the same build as Morrow. He “stood in” so that the lighting crew could get exposure readings for the shooting of Vic’s upcoming performance. The exact reason that, during the 2:00 “rehearsal,” the helicopter was brought in over where Vic and the kids would be crossing the river remained a controversy throughout the case. One of the important clues that investigators never realized was that the helicopter was brought in solely to provide a sample of light from the aircraft’s powerful spotlight. As Liddle walked the path the lighting men passed their light meters near his face. During the light check Liddle noticed a problem. The water around him heaved due to the violent wind effect of the low-flying Huey. He had trouble keeping his balance and the thought flashed through his mind, “You could fall down.” Since it was nearly impossible for anybody, let alone a stand-in, to get the director’s attention, Bob Liddle did not tell Landis that the river bottom was slippery and that Vic might fall.

Instead, at the time of the 2:20 shot he positioned himself at the edge of the water near the action, just as he had done at 9:30. With the promise of thrilling explosions and movie stunt action, Bob Liddle had brought his son to the set. Everybody had heard the rumor, “He’s got some big stuff going.” Just before the last scene began rolling, Liddle saw John Landis sloshing through the water to the spit of sand. Through the raised bullhorn the director exhorted the crowd that no one was to sit down. The tenseness of the spectators could be sensed from the way they scrambled to their feet and formed a wall in the night. A few terrible minutes later Liddle recalled being alone with Vic Morrow. The actor was lying on his stomach as if drinking the water and when Liddle looked closer, he saw that Morrow had been cut in half. He told the investigators that he was kind of “crazy” and “very upset” by the recollection. Liddle’s earlier walk in the water while the lighting men danced around him with their meters was filmed that night and collected among the film secured by the investigators. In this footage Liddle could be seen in that brief cut identified by the clapperboard as DOCU/2:00 which Llorente and more than a dozen investigators watched in the Warner screening room three days after the crash. John Landis and his close associates identified this episode to the NTSB investigators as the “rehearsal” for the 2:20 final shot. Elie Cohn even told the NTSB that during this “rehearsal” he saw Vic Morrow walk the path in the water, which was walked, in fact, by the stand-in Bob Liddle. For almost a year after the crash Don Llorente quietly and patiently interviewed some 35 witnesses. After a while the collection of testimony began to reveal a picture with certain shadings. A few witnesses slammed John Landis for reasons that were subjective. But the personal bias of this sort was offset by witnesses who could not be accused of being hostile to the director. And in the immediate aftermath of the crash, with the details still fresh in their minds, some among Landis’ friends on the set contradicted him in many ways. Two of these friendly witnesses with damaging statements, both longtime intimates of the director, were Kathryn “Boots” Wooten, the script supervisor, and Gary McLarty, the stunt coordinator.

Kathryn Wooten’s and Gary McLarty’s statements to investigators shortly after the crash, while still under the sway of powerful impressions, became a real problem for Landis in the courtroom later. Of these witnesses, no one on the set, apart from George Folsey Jr., had a relationship with the director of as longstanding as Kathryn Wooten’s. Not surprisingly, when district attorney prosecutors requested John Landis’ personal secretary to provide a list of Landis’ close friends, Kathryn Wooten’s name was among those that included the godfather, Universal’s Sean Daniel, and Colleen Camp, the “bikini-girl” from Apocalypse Now. Kathryn Wooten was a sort of super-secretary on the Landis set. As a script girl, or the current “script supervisor,” she stayed close to the director while keeping notes on the filming action for the editor, notes the director himself referred to in order to keep abreast of the shooting. Wooten made note of changes in the script or in dialogue to make sure the actors knew their lines. She also kept production notes, running time and the shot record every day. A product of 60s radicalism and counterculture like most of Landis’ inner circle, “Boots” Wooten began her Hollywood career in the 70s working with Roger Corman’s New World Cinema. Known as the “School of Cinema,” with the reputation as the most successful low-budget film producer, Corman’s company became Hollywood’s most prolific training ground for several then unknown young directors throughout the 60s and 70s like Francis Coppola, Martin Scorsese, Peter Bogdanovich and one of the TZ segment directors, Joe Dante. Though at the time of the TZ movie Wooten had retired from feature film work and was doing commercials, she agreed to work on Landis’ segment because it was short. Previously, on a movie called Heartbeat, Wooten had worked with a helicopter that came in way low and blew up enough dust that she turned her face away and missed noting what the helicopter did. This experience reminded her that on the final night of shooting for the big exploding village shot she wanted to protect her eyes. Safety glasses were not handed out on the set that night but prop master Milgrom, like Wooten a veteran of Animal House and Blues Brothers, had a few pair on his truck.

She also wore the high-suspendered waders and at 2:20, with the cap pulled over her ears and peering through the goggles, she watched the helicopter loom out of the dark sky. As part of her job, she had to see which arms Vic had the children under. They had to match the same arms as in the earlier scene to preserve the film’s continuity. John Landis put the kids in Vic’s arms. Vic started off. The first bomb went off. Immediately people around her started running, realizing that something was wrong. It looked like the helicopter was in trouble right from the very first bomb. At the 11:30 rage scene Wooten had been worried about the helicopter going any lower; they really “overdid” it, she thought. But the blasts at 2:20 were “outrageous”; they were “like three times the size of the rage scene,” she exclaimed to the NTSB investigators. The whole fiery disaster unfolded within a few seconds. Wooten’s memory was incomplete. She heard the explosions and watched the helicopter trying to climb out of the fireballs. She couldn’t move. The people around her were running and she just helplessly watched the whole thing. Within a few moments the commotion settled and everyone realized that, indeed, something was terribly wrong. As she left the set she heard the indescribable wail in the night which no one who heard it could ever forget. She went back to Milgrom’s prop truck. Hilary Leach, the trainee girl, soon arrived at the truck looking for garbage bags to put the dead bodies in. Wooten heard Andy House yelling, “That’s a wrap – everybody go home! Get in your cars, go away!” In the aftermath of the crash Wooten openly complained to the NTSB of the unsafe conditions on the set, the poor planning, the oversize explosions and the use of live ammo. She mentioned particularly dire disorganization and the lack of pre-production meetings where the director explains what he wants. However, though somewhat forthcoming, she was still friends with Landis. She professed herself unable to tell the investigators very much about Myca and Renee. She never had any contact with the children that night, believing Sue Dugan, the women’s wardrobe supervisor who reported directly to Landis’ wife, Deborah, the show’s costume director, was the person who had talked to the kids. Wooten recalled seeing the children in the 9:30 rescue sequence, assuming they were “pretty much put in at the last minute and taken out right away.” She remembered someone mentioning the little boy and there was something being said about", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634243667_cleaned.txt:121:ac261215a117", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 1725, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634243667_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634243667", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634243667_cleaned", "chunk_index": 122, "text": "Myca and Renee.

Joining “Boots” Wooten in the first circle on that set, besides George Folsey Jr. and propman Mike Milgrom, was Gary McLarty, the stunt coordinator. Like Vic Morrow, McLarty was getting on close to 50. He was getting older in a business that was for younger men. Over the years Landis had been a dependable employer, but it wasn’t easy. McLarty belonged to the rough-and-tumble world of men who made their living taking spills and getting catapulted, shot at and pushed over cliffs. They flew through fireballs, hurtled in cars and hung from the skids of a helicopter. In the movie set hierarchy, the stuntmen were close to the SFX people, being usually concerned in the same action-type shots: in a familiar example, special effects people put the explosives in the trunk of a car while a stuntman drives the car. McLarty’s own specialty was doing breakneck car stunts. He coordinated acts of daring on some 300-400 productions, such as Cannonball, Baretta, Rooster Cogburn and Beverly Hills Cop I & II. Ironically, when McLarty began his stunt life a quarter century back one of his earliest jobs was on Combat with Vic Morrow. Hired as the “stunt coordinator” for Landis’ TZ segment, he read the script, made up the budget and brought in a double or doubled himself. On the night of the crash McLarty, like stand-in Bob Liddle, brought his son to the set with the promise of a huge explosive display as the night’s finale. But even the leader of the Hollywood War Babies began to have some doubts just a little after 11:30 upon returning from what he called the “hairiest ride” he’d ever been on. To the NTSB he stated that he told Landis, “We couldn’t take anything hotter or bigger,” and McLarty said he received the director’s assurances that for the upcoming finale the explosions wouldn’t be any larger or the craft any lower. During that final shot McLarty was in the helicopter kneeling on the floor at the machine gun on the right side behind Wingo, facing the cliff. Kenny Endoso, the other stuntman/machine gunner, was on the left behind Allingham with his searchlight, facing the river and most of the film crew.

As the chopper rattled into a start position and hovered for about 20 seconds, McLarty from the open door could see Vic holding the kids down below. “It was awful windy on him right then,” he recalled, “not enough to blow him down, but I could sure see the effect from the water.” Once they received the cue from the ground McLarty was supposed to start firing – Vic’s cue to start his action towards the camera. But when McLarty fired, his fully automatic .50- caliber machine gun, like so many things that night, jammed up. By then McLarty, facing the cliff, had lost sight of Vic while, according to his recollection, the helicopter began making a planned 180-degree turn and started back. In this brief account related shortly after the crash, McLarty contradicted Landis on some key points. Like others before him, the stunt coordinator described the helicopter making the “180-degree turn” which Allingham in his first statement to the NTSB had described as the “U-turn” until corrected by one of his lawyers because it contradicted the director’s statement that the plan was for the helicopter to cross the river. On the crucial issue of the bullhorn, McLarty claimed that Vic’s cue was the firing of the machine gun, disputing the director who said that Vic’s action cue to start his forward motion was his, Landis’, waving the bullhorn. If the director wasn’t using his bullhorn to cue Vic – that being McLarty’s task – the signaling with his bullhorn was more likely to have been a waving motion to bring the helicopter lower, which many witnesses said they had seen. This issue of why the stunt coordinator was on the helicopter firing a machine gun and not directing the stunt would flare into bitter debate during the trial, for it very clearly showed who was in charge on the set. Being on the helicopter at 2:20 firing one of the machine guns, McLarty stated, was “all that they wanted me to do those last two evenings.” The Nazi sequence with the French street scene in which McLarty took the fall two stories down from an apartment building was the first to be filmed of the three episodes chronicling Bill’s transformation. Among the onlookers on Universal’s backlot were Mr. and Mrs. Wolf Nadoolman. Their daughter had brought her new baby to the set.

Among the onlookers on Universal’s backlot were Mr. and Mrs. Wolf Nadoolman. Their daughter had brought her new baby to the set. That night Deborah Nadoolman Landis, with the infant in arms, occasionally shouting and ordering people around, was the pharaoh’s wife; and many felt that when she fell into a towering mood it was probably best to somehow get out of the way. She was the film’s costumer; and her husband was the Hollywood director who was not deterred by the presence of his in-laws into changing his style. Some crew members could sense the embarrassment of the middle-aged couple as they watched him squeal profanities and abuse prior to the shooting of this scene. For the Nazi sequence the artists working under Richard Sawyer had been instructed to come up with sketches to create the authenticity of a French street in 1941 occupied France. A short strip of cobblestone street with fake French house fronts, complete with Nazi propaganda posters on the wall and old-fashioned neon lights, was made ready for Bill’s Twilight Zone encounter with his persecutors. Like every scene in the segment, it was a chase scene shot “night for night”; here Bill, while being pursued, climbs out of a window and runs along a ledge to the next building where he falls from the roof. For the close-up part of the scene Vic Morrow ran along the ledge prodded by the director’s barking below. “Faster! Faster!” Landis shouted. Vic did his best. Though the ledge was only eight feet above the ground it was high enough to hurt the aging actor if he fell onto the hard cobblestones below. The more dangerous wide-angle part of the shot was to show Bill three stories up on the ledge. A huge air bag was laid down on the street and a young professional stuntman that McLarty had hired tried the dangerous fall twice; each time he failed to satisfy Landis’ drive for realism. After the second try and a few profanities from Landis, he was removed and the director gave the nod to McLarty who gathered up his aging bones for another tumble. Knowing from working with the director the kind of fall he really wanted, McLarty ran the ledge and flung himself to the ground. Landis’ cinematic trademark for stunts and action showed a drive for realism which most on the set saw as an infinite capacity for excess. In the last part of a railyard scene the special effects rain was so intense that the cameramen squawked about the volume of water.

On Camera A, Arnold Rich stopped filming in order to change into dry clothing afterwards. In this scene Bill, with the yellow felt star of David pinned to his chest, is clubbed and taken to a box car being loaded with 30 people playing Jewish prisoners. Once in the box car, the door was slammed shut and locked. The realism took a threatening turn when shortly after Landis yelled, “That’s a cut!” there was a small explosion as the simulated rain shorted out a circuit and an electrical fire broke out on the set near the box car. The makeup man, Bob Westmoreland, noticed it and ran to Landis whom he found deep in gesticulating conversation with Folsey and Cohn. Westmoreland reminded the director that there was a real lock on the door with real people inside the car. They soon found the key and disaster was deferred for another week. Four years later at the Twilight Zone trial it would be argued that Mc-Larty did not stand in for Vic in the final scene solely to satisfy the director’s obsession with realism. Gary McLarty recalled that Vic wanted to do the “running stuff,” though admitting that he didn’t talk to Vic at any time during the last two nights. Perhaps to show the young director that he could be relied upon, Vic Morrow did consent to do the running actions. But the question that arose at the trial was whether the director had used his power to pressure Morrow. Had he intimidated him? Did he urge the susceptible actor to do the scene himself with the promise of increased exposure that would help his comeback? At least part of the exposure would have been the close-up of Bill by Camera A operated by Arnold Rich. The frame in Rich’s lens would show a face made dramatically hard-bitten by the “herculean effort” in the river under blazing fireballs. Originally, the shooting schedule for that night clearly called for Bill and a double. But had that been followed, and Mc-Larty had stood in for Vic, Landis would not have had his “shot,” for there couldn’t have been a close-up with the real Vic Morrow with real kids.

Each shot in a film may be covered by as little as one camera with a cameraman and his assistant to as many as 10-15 cameras under the direction of a single director of photography. The DP is one of the highest-paid members of the crew – the better-known can even bargain for top salaries. For the 2:20 shot John Landis used more cameramen than for any of his previous scenes. Even at the last minute the director of photography, Steve Larner, was drafted into the finale, making it six cameras. In all there were more than a dozen cameramen distributed within a few hundred yards on land, in the river, on the top of the cliff and airborne in the chopper. Michael Scott on Camera E was buckled to a tree overhanging the cliffs edge at a 90-ft. height. Roger Smith, strapped in a harness, balanced with Camera D on the helicopter skids. Steve Lydecker with Camera B, the master shot, leaned out over the intensely lit scene on the delicately calibrated arm of the Chapman crane. Camera A, Arnold Rich, stood with his sensitive machine below the crane. Connor and Larner, the C and F cameramen, stood in their waders in the water behind cameras mounted on tripods looking down the river. After the close call during the earlier rage scene, the assistant on D camera, Randy Robinson, a recruit from the Spielberg network, had vowed vehemently not to go back up in the helicopter again. Robinson’s immediate superior, Roger Smith, had listened intently to warnings from the A camera operator, Arnold Rich, a Hollywood veteran with more than 40 years’ experience on movie sets. For the final shot Rich was facing the village across the river, taking close-up shots of Vic and the kids as they came running towards him. Rich had advised Smith of his safety concerns after the earlier close call. Camera D operator Michael Scott was so worried about the 2:20 shot that he had even asked one of the powdermen whether he would be safe on the cliff for the final scene; during the earlier rage scene Scott had been startled to see fireballs streaming over the top of the 90-foot cliff where he was to assume his position during the exploding village scene.

When he did, the director screamed, “Are you too scared to do that shot?” Apart from George Folsey Jr., there was no one on the TZ set whose family and personal life was so deeply rooted in the film capital as that of Steve Lydecker. Lydecker’s father Howard and Uncle Theodore, both film pioneers like Folsey Sr., were noted for their contributions to Hollywood cinematography. Steve Lydecker’s father was a special effects man in the old days when this meant not just handling explosives but, like Lydecker Sr., many were “miniaturists”; they built, for instance, a dam so tiny that it took little more than a match to blow it up-the enlarging faculty of the camera did the rest, along with skillful cutting by the editor. Howard Lydecker was a Hall of Fame recipient who had signed the first four pyrotechnic cards in Hollywood. Howard’s brother, Uncle Theodore, was an innovative cameraman with a highly respected name in the film industry. Both Howard and Theodore Lydecker were known in the 30s for the sensationalistic illusions they produced at Republic Pictures. The pictures that won the Lydeckers acclaim were the 1935 The Phantom Empire, an early sci-fi film about a fantastic underground city, another 1935 film, Fighting Marines, and an early Rambo picture. In 1937 Howard Lydecker headed up the special effects department at Republic Pictures, overseeing car wrecks and assorted disasters. The serials the Lydeckers created at Republic won distinction for their exaggerated action-adventure, considered by many the inspiration for the 1981 Raiders of the Lost Ark. Film historian George Turner has called this Lucas-Spielberg production featuring Indiana Jones a “tribute to Lydecker.” Steve Lydecker started working on movie sets in his teens. In a quarter-century motion picture career he was a camera operator, special effects man and assistant director. Having logged many hours as a cameraman in a helicopter as well as fixed-wing aircraft, he was thoroughly knowledgeable about explosives, using precise technical language, referring to helicopter parts and maneuvers, the magnitude of explosions and the role of cameras. He filmed “stunt stuff” on Smokey and the Bandit, Cannonball and many other films. The ill foreboding he had about the whole TZ production grew stronger in the final days of shooting, when he witnessed one particularly disturbing incident. During the actual trial several years later, the Landis defense team frivolously dubbed this incident “the banana plant murders.” It involved the use of live ammo during the filming of scene 19, the sequence which calls for Bill, while eluding Viet Cong, to dive into", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634243667_cleaned.txt:127:aed7f226b0fd", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 1731, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634243667_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634243667", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634243667_cleaned", "chunk_index": 128, "text": "on Smokey and the Bandit, Cannonball and many other films. The ill foreboding he had about the whole TZ production grew stronger in the final days of shooting, when he witnessed one particularly disturbing incident. During the actual trial several years later, the Landis defense team frivolously dubbed this incident “the banana plant murders.” It involved the use of live ammo during the filming of scene 19, the sequence which calls for Bill, while eluding Viet Cong, to dive into some bushes floating in a Vietnamese swamp simulated by the shallow Santa Clara river. There was a platoon of about a dozen soldiers dressed in U.S. Army uniforms carrying M-16s. Vic was to emerge from the swamp and start to run, waving his arms, “I’m an American, I’m an American.” The marbles bounced off the plants and the director cut twice, complaining that the SFX chief didn’t give him the shot he wanted. And Lydecker heard Paul Stewart say, “I’m gonna have to hit with explosives, with bullet hits,” and the director’s anxious reply, “How long’s that gonna take?” and Stewart, “Approximately 15 minutes.” Just before the shooting started, Vic Morrow jumped out of the way. He went under the water, then came back up and Kenny Endoso, the stuntman, grabbed the actor and pulled him out of the water onto the bank. While the shotguns blasted away, Vic hid behind some flimsy bushes which promised little protection if one of the wide-pattern pellets strayed. Lydecker put earplugs in his ears. When the shooting was over, he noticed that Vic looked very shaken as he crawled out of the bushes. Steve Lydecker was tall, balding, somewhat portly around the middle. His approach to problems was deliberate, almost pedantic. He had an expert knowledge of guns. He was a tracker of the wilds, a hunter and outdoorsman who reloaded his own shotgun shells. Reg Parton, the Hollywood stuntman on Llorente’s NTSB team, surprised by the report of live ammo on the set, asked if he was mistaken about the live ammo or whether they could possibly have been using blanks? “They were not blanks, sir, they were sitting on my battery out in the water and I looked.” He had actually found an empty ammo box with the marking precisely as he had established it - …^(n)12 gauge double-aught buck shotgun shells.” According to Lydecker, there “was a thousand one, thousand two, Vic jumped out of the way, thousand three, thousand four, and the shotguns started in,” giving Vic no more than two seconds to dive into the bushes. As far as Lydecker knew the use of live ammo on a movie set had long been extinct in Hollywood. Like many on the set, Lydecker was aware of the director’s drive to “out-Spielberg Spielberg.” They were all engaged in an undertaking, it seemed, to teach Steven Spielberg a lesson in creativity.", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634243667_cleaned.txt:128:608a097d21ea", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 1732, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634243667_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634243667", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634243667_cleaned", "chunk_index": 129, "text": "two, Vic jumped out of the way, thousand three, thousand four, and the shotguns started in,” giving Vic no more than two seconds to dive into the bushes.

Like many on the set, Lydecker was aware of the director’s drive to “out-Spielberg Spielberg.” They were all engaged in an undertaking, it seemed, to teach Steven Spielberg a lesson in creativity. While filming one of the Vietnam village scenes Lydecker heard Landis bragging to some guests that his film was all original. “It’s going to be so much better than Steven’s,” Lydecker heard the director say while dismissing the efforts of his co-producer, friend and rival. Positioned aloft some twenty feet above the river looking down into the set, Lydecker’s perspective from the finely balanced arm of the Chapman crane permitted his camera a view of the entire village. His wide-angle frame was the master shot for the big scene. The helicopter was not to be in it, so that when the command to roll came Lydecker realized almost at once there was a problem when the skids suddenly appeared in the top of the frame! Especially built for the movie industry, the arm of the Chapman crane was balanced exactly for the weight of the camera and the men on it that included, besides Lydecker and Nakaido, Morgan Renard, the TZ movie’s still photographer. Panic-stricken, Nakaido was about to jump off the crane – an action threatening catastrophe worse perhaps than the oncoming helicopter. If someone suddenly departed, as Nakaido threatened to do, the sudden loss of weight would cause the arm to fly up and hurtle everyone in the air. Meanwhile, the danger of the onrushing gunship passed as the craft, after completing a 360-degree spin, landed at an approximately 70-degree angle in the water, with the nose of the helicopter facing him and the tail facing the set. Lydecker kept his camera running while the grips on the ground “armed” him down through the trees. It would be important to have some type of evidence, Lydecker figured; he told Morgan Renard to keep going with his still camera. At this point Lydecker still didn’t know that Vic Morrow and the kids had been killed, but after dashing the few yards to the tipped-over helicopter he received his first indication of the true scope of the disaster. He saw Randy Robinson standing in a daze next to the scorched, lopsided craft. The engine kept up a hacking noise as Lydecker reached into the crippled craft and helped cut down Roger Smith from his harness. Together with Robinson he helped Smith out the side of the helicopter. The three men splashed through water that ran red with blood, like survivors of a battle.

The three men splashed through water that ran red with blood, like survivors of a battle. Awaiting them at the shoreline was an actor gotten up in a Nazi dress uniform, one of the two extras who portrayed Nazi soldiers as called for in scene 34 which continues the chase sequence after the village explodes and Bill escapes from the helicopter. The extra was one of the Germans who recaptures Bill in the wooden shed. It was that quality of a remote scene dominated by some large brooding presence, the large green hulk in the hot scorched summer dunes, that presented itself to the artist’s eye of Tom Southwell. Southwell was first to arrive on that Wednesday, July 22, ostensibly the final day of shooting. As one of the show’s illustrators who worked for set designer Sawyer he had done many of the set sketches and storyboards in pre-production, including the sketch of the village that was used as the model to build it from. The job he came out to do that afternoon, to paint the attacking eagle insignia and FLY BY NIGHT legend on the nose of the helicopter, was normally done by a sign painter. Southwell had never done this sort of painting before, but came out to the set in kindness to Sawyer’s tight budget. Tom Southwell’s arrival in the hot afternoon the day before the crash was marked by an eerie incident, a portent of the waiting disaster. Southwell met a guard. She was a young woman who stood watch over the helicopter and to his question where the helicopter was, she gave the unsettling reply, “Oh, you mean the one they’re going to crash?” He informed her that what she had seen was a “spotting plan” for setting up camera angles and special effects, and that even though it seemed to show a crashed helicopter,the drawing actually showed the helicopter lying on its side with broken rotor blades! It had nothing to do with the planning. He assured her that the helicopter he was looking for was not going to crash that night. On the helipad by the dam Southwell started painting the nose of the Huey after the sketch he had drawn for the director’s approval the week before. A number of ideas for the logo had been considered. One, “Death From Above,” was ruled out because it had been used in Apocalypse Now. For another, “Grim Reaper,” Southwell made some sketches. John Landis rejected some skull designs he drew. Finally, Richard Sawyer told Southwell that", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634243667_cleaned.txt:130:d5c6c68898ae", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 1734, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634243667_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634243667", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634243667_cleaned", "chunk_index": 131, "text": "not going to crash that night.

John Landis rejected some skull designs he drew. Finally, Richard Sawyer told Southwell that the director wanted to use his company name and spelled out exactly the image Landis wanted – an attacking eagle with spread wings and talons extended and over it the bold legend, FLY BY NIGHT. While Southwell painted, upstream on the other side of the river about 100 yards away, the helicopter pilot arrived. Dorcey Wingo was casually dressed and just as he made his appearance the first person to greet him was Southwell’s boss, Richard Sawyer; Sawyer immediately suggested that they go over and see the set. They drove in Sawyer’s car to where the Chapman crane would later be positioned. A bunch of people were milling around in shorts, being upbeat and slightly boisterous like people at a party. One woman was drinking beer. Other people were drinking soft drinks from a big barrel. It was Wingo’s first time on a big movie set. He shared Sawyer’s excitement and everyone else’s, it seemed, to be working in a Spielberg production. Sawyer took off his shoes. The set designer began merrily wading across the river. In between snapping pictures of the village set with his 35mm . camera, he waved invitingly to Wingo. The pilot didn’t like going around barefoot. He had tender feet. The pilot took off his shoes and tested the water. There were pebbles on the bottom. Wingo put his shoes back on and waited on the shore until Sawyer returned. It was about 6 p.m. when Sawyer drove Wingo to the helipad where Southwell was just finishing up. The eagle glared aggressively in lurid colors from the Huey’s freshly painted nose. Tom Southwell wasn’t a sign painter, which, he admitted, anyone could tell by looking closely at the uneven quality of the FLY BY NIGHT lettering. Wingo had himself painted insignia in Vietnam and as an amateur cartoonist had offered some suggestions to Allingham for this one. But Allingham had told him it was already decided. Around that time Dan Allingham showed up. Other people also began to arrive. Although it was already nighttime it was just another Hollywood working day. Allingham soon got word over his radio from the director.

Not long after the evening fly-by, the helicopter’s first call to action came and the outpost in the riverbend sprang alive. The first shot employing the helicopter was to establish the aircraft on the screen. It should have been a simple dash; no action, no explosives. But nothing was ever simple during those bedeviled nights at Indian Dunes. John Landis was all over the place on this twelfth and presumably last night of shooting. The gangling wunderkind seemed giddy with happiness as he clowned and bobbed holding his barely two-month-old daughter Rachel in front of “Still-man” Morgan Renard’s camera. Though hired on as the show’s still photographer for the purpose of gathering publicity shots, Renard was often distracted that night by Landis’ constant requests for more baby photos. It was a very crowded evening in which altogether seven key scenes pertaining to the Vietnam sequence were to be shot. With the production falling behind, the young director began showing flashes of quirky boyish temper. His mood did not improve when he was told by his 1st AD that they wouldn’t have time “to do the stunt,” meaning the big explosion scenes. At one point, while several crew members looked on, John Landis turned brusquely to his shot list and in a belligerent tone stated that he had carefully planned out the entire shooting schedule and that despite an inept crew it would get done. Throughout the evening he shouted and scowled, and his high-pitched squealing could be heard over the walkie-talkie by Roger Smith’s assistant on the E Camera, Randy Robinson, up in the helicopter seated behind Wingo and Allingham. For its first call the chopper had come in clattering over the river from the east, heading west, where John Landis had picked out a bunch of trees that he wanted the helicopter to come in from behind. But a problem with the radios cropped up right away. Distrustful of the set walkie-talkie, Wingo wanted to stick with the special VHF radio.

Being connected to this hot mike system enabled Robinson to hear what Landis was saying to Allingham. “They started this intimidation thing with Dorcey,” Robinson later told Llorente. “They kept trying to get us to come to a certain tree, and they said, ‘Can’t you see this tree?’ and they’d yell and scream at us, and then Dan would sort of laugh and say, ‘Look, guys, it’s not like positioning some Volkswagen up here.’ He’d say, ‘What tree do you want? Put a tag on it and we’ll know which one you’re talking about, because there are a hundred trees up here!”’ Dan Allingham was the busiest man on the set that night. His duties had accumulated by doubling up and more doubling up, so that by the time he climbed aboard the Huey for the final shot he held almost a half-dozen jobs. He was unit production manager, an assistant director, spotlight gaffer, and the 2nd unit coordinator, whose duties actually overlapped with those of the stunt coordinator. But most importantly, he was Landis’ envoy to control the helicopter crew. He had a slogan, Randy Robinson recalled, imitating Allingham’s voice: “No, no, you’re right. Safety first-ta-da-ta-da-ta-da-ta-da…” Aboard the chopper, by direction of the UPM, Randy Robinson was also doubling up. He was working as camera assistant to Roger Smith, as well as with the two machine-gunner/stuntmen, giving them assistance. Though Robinson could not talk to Allingham and Wingo because of a defective hot mike, his headset enabled him to hear what was being said between the air and ground. Thus, it happened that in the investigation of the crash Robinson managed to complete much of the picture which Allingham so frequently left blank by his repeated claims of, “I don’t remember.” Since he would be filming out on the helicopter skids directly exposed to the fireballs, no one was more pleased with Allingham assurances of “safety first” than Roger Smith. He had worked with Allingham before and felt relieved. Having been out on the skids at 11:30 and come close to being consumed by heat blasts, he had nervously masked his deep unease by making light of his fear. “I don’t want to get my pants burned off with one of those firebombs underneath,” he had nervously joked. Allingham told him that for the final flight they would be over the water away from the explosions, and, pleased, Smith proposed that the pilot turn the chopper around so that it would be like a “camera platform,” allowing him to shoot the village exploding in the background.

His assistant Randy Robinson recalled clearly Dan Allingham’s final words just as the Huey lifted off for the final shot. “Don’t worry about any of these explosions ‘cause we’re going to be out of there before they even go off.” With the chopper flying upstream they were moving into position so as to put the village shoreline on the chopper’s left side where Allingham sat spotting the light. Allingham’s seat was normally that of the pilot who, due to the position of the Nite-Sun, operated the craft from the passenger seat on the right side from where he kept his eyes fixed on the cliff. He measured the dangerously tiny gap between the tip of his overhead main rotor blades and the 90-foot wall of the cliff behind the village. Robinson and Wingo could hear through their headsets the directions Allingham was getting from the ground. Allingham was nervous and talked incessantly. In the complex radio web, his words literally doubled up. There could be no mistaking them. Wingo and Robinson could hear the order from the ground on their headset and then hear Allingham repeat it in his hot mike. Except for Dan Allingham and the pilot, Randy Robinson was the only one in direct communication with the people on the ground directing the movement of the helicopter during the final flight. Robinson was the only one, in fact, who was able to overhear the communications between three of the five future defendants in the Twilight Zone trial, John Landis, Dan Allingham and Dorcey Wingo. Robinson heard the fatal order, from the ground first, then from Allingham – not once but twice. By the time the helicopter was ordered into its final hover, the blades were probably within five feet of touching the cliff. With the chopper in position to start the scene, Allingham relayed the frantic commands from the ground. Robinson tapped the shoulders of the stuntmen, shouting, “Fire! Fire! Fire!” Roger Smith, stepping out onto the skids with his camera, saw Vic Morrow with the kids standing underneath the helicopter, and fairly close. As this dramatic scene was still unfolding the first explosion went off on the shoreline, occurring at the one o’clock position from the ship.

Can’t they see we’re in trouble? Why do they keep blasting us?” In addition to the airborne cameramen on the chopper, for the last two nights of shooting John Landis hired two additional camera crews headed by John Connor on Camera C and Michael Scott up on the cliff shooting down with Camera D. For the fatal flight the director of photography put Connor in the river with the 75-millimeter on a tripod to film a side view of Vic Morrow and the kids against a backdrop of explosives – ”a wall of fire” – downstream at the dam. Landis was so determined on having that shot that he decided at the very last moment to put the DP on a sixth camera, F, as guarantee for Camera C getting his shot. Quite accidentally, Connor’s Camera C ended up filming the DOCU/2.00 footage just before the fatal shot that night, as part of a separate pet project of Frank Marshall, the production’s executive producer. John Connor knew Marshall from some films, notably E.T., on which Marshall had also been executive producer. On the night before the final shot, he ran into Marshall again. Connor introduced him to his assistant Lee Redmond. Marshall was with Kathleen Kennedy, his business partner and girlfriend, who was also a business associate and close friend of Spielberg’s. Marshall asked Connor to shoot some of the “interesting” side details for one of his Making of … documentaries. The footage was to be shown to theatre owners, Marshall explained, making them feel they were a part of the film’s production. The most interesting shot Connor picked out for Marshall occurred at 2:00 a.m. on his second and last night of filming. It showed John Landis standing in the water and the helicopter coming in. According to Connor’s understanding, the helicopter flight at that time was not a rehearsal but a chance to “establish how the light part of the film’s production would be shining down on the actors,” and the film he shot depicted the director clearly pointing to the place where he wanted it to shine.

Just prior to the upcoming final flight they had to measure the intensity of the lighting at the precise spot where the kids would later pass through the frame from left to right since Connor was to capture with his camera the silhouettes of the actors against the “wall of fire” downstream behind them. At 2 : 00 A.M. ., in order to coordinate the timing with the special-effects men, Connor and the DP, both in waders, consulted with Paul Stewart. That’s when it was decided to plant a tall stick in the middle of the river – a “eukie” pole left over from building the huts – so as to mark the point where Stewart would cue the downstream explosions at just the moment when Vic and the kids were lined up with the explosions in perfect position for Connor’s camera. The “stick” became a reference point to help Connor and others line up the shot at an angle where it would record the maximum and most dramatic effect of all those elements the director wanted in the shot. But as Connor turned the camera for the DOCU/2:00 footage, he was, unbeknownst to himself, assisting in the creation of yet another mystery. The “stick” prominent in his shot would join the bullhorn in becoming the subject of much lawyerly contention. In Landis’ version of the 2:00 “rehearsal” the stick was explained as the point in the water towards which Vic would run, while Connor knew it only as something that he, Larner and Stewart planted to aid his camera to focus on the background explosions for the big shot. While the DOCU/2:00 clip was being filmed for Frank Marshall, and the stand-in walked the path to be taken by Vic and the kids some 20 minutes later, the director of photography noted down his light readings. Connor was filming the shot from a considerable distance, 45-feet upstream. He used the positioning of stand-in Bob Liddle to set the proper focus on his camera for the final shot that would require a full frame of Vic, head-to-toe, so you could see that the actor was in the water about knee-deep. In order to achieve this effect, Connor’s Camera C needed just the right lighting conditions, showing the reflections of the downstream background explosions", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634243667_cleaned.txt:136:0d441b16ea80", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 1740, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634243667_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634243667", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634243667_cleaned", "chunk_index": 137, "text": "down his light readings.

In order to achieve this effect, Connor’s Camera C needed just the right lighting conditions, showing the reflections of the downstream background explosions on the foreground of the water and just about four feet of the background explosions above Vic’s head in the camera. As director of photography, Steve Larner was key in the 2:00 lighting check. He was responsible for coordinating the camera exposures for the lighting effects required for the exploding village scene. He had to know the direction of the lights shining down from both the helicopter and the scaffolding that had been erected slightly upstream, about 10 feet behind Connor, on which were mounted the powerful arc lamps to illuminate the scene. As far as Larner knew, the third flight of the helicopter at 2 : 00A.M . was solely for the purpose of establishing lighting positions with respect to Camera C. It had nothing to do with the complaints of the helicopter’s crew following their rocky flight in the near fatal 11:30 shot. Larner specifically stated to the NTSB his understanding that this 2 : 00 A.M . flight was not a “rehearsal,” nor did he recollect anything being mentioned about safety concerns as the reason for that particular flight. During questioning by the NTSB, in direct contradiction of John Landis, Larner stated that the helicopter’s fourth and final flight that evening did not happen as he had expected. It was completely different in its execution from that which had been previously discussed. “The helicopter was much lower than everybody thought it would be,” Larner recalled. The helicopter was not planned to be in any of the shots of the six cameras, except from above in Camera D on the cliff. As far as the DP knew from what he had been told by Landis, the craft was to be used in the final scene only to create the lighting effect and propwash on the water. Like Lydecker on Camera B, Larner had been told by Landis that the helicopter should remain above the frame of the Camera B master shot. The NTSB investigators understood that the actor was passing from left to right in the frames of Camera C and F, and they asked Larner whether Vic showed any hesitation while making his dash with the kids.

His object was to identify, according to the statutes, the employer legally responsible under the provision of the law. It was, therefore, highly surprising that within a month of the crash, on August 24, 1982, the labor commission’s Southern California office issued its final report in which the only reference to Warner Bros. Inc. was a copy of a declaration made by a studio vice president, Ed Morey. The commission’s report included 20 exhibits, many supplied by Warner attorneys. But notably absent from this nearly 150-page document was any mention of Frank Marshall, Lucy Fisher, Fred Gallo, or any of the other Warner studio brass involved in the Landis segment, including Terry Semel, Warner’s president. If the absence of these names demonstrated anything it was the success of Warner’s low-intensity legal barrages aimed at the state and local agencies that targeted it for blame in the affair. In this battle of lawyers Warner would walk a very fine line between having to protect the Spielberg-Landis partnership and the TZ production on the one hand, while at the same time keeping itself out of the scandal created by the crash. Thus, Warner developed a policy of limited cooperation with the investigators which eventually forced the studio to choose between Spielberg and Landis. The studio was compelled into this predicament through the “politics” of the case: the multi-million-dollar lawsuits soon to be filed by the survivors, and, though it was as yet unfocused, the anticipated criminal investigation, which left open the possibility that one of its own executives might become involved criminally. But the guiding motive behind the “politics,” since it had the most far-reaching implications for Warner’s bottom-line, was Steven Spielberg. Whenever possible Warner pursued the strategy of coordinating its activities to protect all three entities – Spielberg, Landis, and itself. But as these interests came into conflict it was always Landis who would be sacrificed to the interest the studio had in its precious relationship with Steven Spielberg.

With its parent company, Warner Communications, troubled by its Atari video division just then beginning its nosedive crash that summer, Spielberg constituted a bright spot in the corporate effort to remain profitable through its Warner Bros., studio division in Hollywood. The movie company’s leading dilemma in establishing a consistent legal defense in the case arose out of the way the production was set up. It was an extremely complicated and unusual deal by Hollywood standards. There were multi-producers, multi-directors, multi-segments and different crews for different parts of the film. Different payment systems, as well as many different companies were involved: Levitsky, Fly By Night, Stinky Films (Folsey’s business entity!), Disc Management, Twilight Zone Productions, to name a few. In this complicated business and legal tangle it was frequently difficult sorting out who was ultimately responsible for controlling the production. From the narrow legal point of view the investigators were interested only in determining the employer as defined by law. And more specifically, which of the different participants involved in the production had knowledge of illegal acts and had the power to override them. His most memorable recent Hollywood hassle involved Dino de Laurentiis Productions which had Tatum O’Neal, when she was still a minor, working until midnight without proper permits or waivers. In Charlie Hughes’ experience it was usually the “independents” – the small independent producers – or the smaller production organizations with whom he had most trouble enforcing labor standards in the hiring of kids. Indeed, when the two lawyers from O’Melveny & Myers, William Vaughn and Scott Dunham, informed him that Warner was itself unaware of the illegal child-hiring practices on the Landis set, Hughes laid the question off on the fact that Landis’s might be one of those runaway productions notorious for their loose interpretation of the statutes. Awed by the big studio and flattered by the attention paid him by law guns from the famous legal firm hired by Warner, Hughes communicated regularly, and perhaps indiscreetly, with Dunham and Vaughn in connection with the labor commissioner’s investigation of the Twilight Zone crash. Charlie Hughes would look back and wonder how he’d let himself be used as an inside source by Warner’s lawyers. He was voluble on his most famous assignment, his three weeks on the Twilight Zone case with the O’Melveny men, Dunham and Vaughn, who, both tall as beanstalks draped in long flannel well-tailored business suits, made quite a contrast to the rumpled civil servant.

Five years later, Charlie confessed in a wheezing voice that, during his stint as child labor investigator on the Twilight Zone case, he used to call the two lawyers on a daily basis, sometimes 2-3 times daily, informing them about the labor commission investigation. He even carried their business cards with their home numbers handwritten on the back. Contritely, he referred to himself as a “stoolie” for his disloyalty to the labor commissioner. The excellent rapport the Warner lawyers established with the salty but impressionable investigator paid off. Of all the potential targets in the investigation, many of whom were interviewed, Warner was able to convince Hughes that its involvement in the violations of law were only of the most limited nature. In fact, the lawyers led Charlie to believe that they could prove Warner’s complete innocence in the child labor question. But the success with Charlie had its downside. Warner’s position logically pointed the finger of ultimate legal responsibility to the people directly involved: John Landis, George Folsey Jr. and Dan Allingham. This in itself involved a delicate maneuver, for the Landis group had to be implicated in a subtle way that did not draw attention to Frank Marshall, Spielberg’s right-hand man. Charlie Hughes was vastly overpowered by the sophisticated tactics of the two fast legal guns from “O’Melveny.” They successfully deflected his probe from key Warner figures like Marshall, Fisher, Gallo and Steven Spielberg, so that when eventually he brought his boss Colleen Logan a declaration from a Warner Bros. vice president which pointed the finger at the Landis group, he was congratulated. Hughes was actually credited with having scored a coup! The author of the declaration, Warner Bros. VP Ed Morey, regularly received documentation regarding the various production schedules describing the scenes, their location, cast and stage of production. He also received the call sheets which describe the set, actors and crew to be used on each shooting day, and the “poop sheets,” i.e., preliminary reports, as well as the production reports with information prepared after each day of photography. Charlie Hughes was satisfied to receive from Ed Morey a declaration which made it seem that the Landis group alone was responsible for the disaster and that Warner had no knowledge of the illegality of the children on the set. Issued August 6, 1982, Morey’s statement came exactly two weeks after the crash.

By that time the Warner lawyers knew far more than what was revealed in the statement, more than Morey revealed in his declaration, more than the studio ever publicly made known over the five years of the TZ case. Specifically, they were aware of the studio’s, Spielberg’s and Marshall’s involvement in the illegal hiring of the children to an extent far greater than the Morey statement disclosed. Even while local police and authorities were still looking for no more than the bare story behind what happened at Indian Dunes, Warner alone had already begun interviewing the most critical witnesses to the crash. At the same time, within days of the disaster, if not hours, Warner had formed a very fragile, and often bitter, alliance with the Landis group. The labor investigator’s willingness to accept a written declaration from the famous O’Melveny lawyers spared Warner’s Morey at this early stage from any potentially revealing interrogations. The Morey declaration came to Charlie Hughes on the letterhead paper of O’Melveny & Myers, listing offices in downtown Los Angeles, Newport Beach, Washington and on Place de la Concorde in Paris. It was signed by William Vaughn. The friendly letter stated that the enclosed declaration concerned Morey’s “recollection of the events of July 22,” the night of the final shoot. It omitted any mention of the preceding days of the production when the kids and their unusual cash payments were actually discussed with Morey at various Warner meetings. In his narrowly focused declaration, Morey stated that he had been away on vacation from July 2 until July 19 while most of the Landis segment was being filmed. It was upon his return to the office on July 22, while comparing the poop sheets with the shooting schedule, that he discovered under the column “Cast & Atmos” (Cast and Atmosphere) that there was no reference to children or a welfare worker, even though kids were called for in scenes 29 and 31, still to be shot. Since this violated procedure, Morey stated that he called up the UPM to inform him about the discrepancy and that Allingham only said, “he had been in the helicopter most of the previous night” and did not really know anything about it. According to Morey, Allingham explained that “someone else was taking care of that aspect of things.” Five days before, Morey, vice-president in charge of production, told Warner lawyers that the day before the final shot he was asked to approve a check “to pay some kids under the table.” “Absolutely not, no way,” he claimed he", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634243667_cleaned.txt:141:83a8352e39b8", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 1745, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634243667_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634243667", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634243667_cleaned", "chunk_index": 142, "text": "and that Allingham only said, “he had been in the helicopter most of the previous night” and did not really know anything about it.

Essentially it was his job to prevent a production from becoming a Heaven’s Gate or Blues Brothers by going head-over-heel into cost overruns. But in overseeing the Landis segment he shared the same dilemma as that faced by his boss, Fred Gallo. They gritted their teeth at the liberties taken by the Landis people. Powerlessly they watched normal production proceedings being flouted. Landis was given power no film maker was given. It exceeded that of most auteur directors. He not only had final cut, but the production executives had given him final say over most budget decisions… O n Friday night, July 16, a week before the fatal scene, John Landisshot scene 23, the Ku Klux Klan sequence of his segment, the the Twilight Zone. The production crew of about 60-70 people was set up at Franklin Canyon, a small wooded glade little-known even to native Angelenos, in the middle of the Santa Monica Mountains that separated the San Fernando Valley from Hollywood and the city. With naturally scenic props of thickets and trees and several small ponds, Franklin Canyon was close-by and a cheap location often used to shoot movies. In scene 23 Bill continues his journey into the “Twilight Zone.” After his flight from the Nazis he’s captured by Klansmen and led to a burning cross. There a fight breaks out between Bill and one of his hooded captors. The fight required a “flame gag,” the term stuntmen use when a stuntman is actually set on fire. The scene ends with Bill shoving the Klansman into the burning cross, igniting his sheets. The Klansman, covered with flames, rolls yelling and screaming over the ground. The person doing the flame gag was Gary McLarty. Vic Morrow played Bill. There was real action on the set that night.

Grips were busy laying the track along which the camera is dollied in a “tracking shot.” The sound man angled his boom close to the burning cross to catch the crackling of the flames. There were four Klansmen, their hoods eerily slit with eye-sockets. Two were the director’s film friends, doubling up: Mike Milgrom, the propman, and Eddy “Donut” Dunno, the stuntman. While the cameras rolled, firemen kept watch with hoses and buckets. Earlier, for safety reasons, the firemen had the director substitute the wooden cross for one of asbestos. In another modification to guarantee safety they insisted on changing Landis’ original plan to film a chase with flaming torches, restricting it to the open road, away from the dry brush that dotted the canyon. The area was known for fierce summer brush fires that sometimes spread to the opulent homes in the wild-looking canyons. The pressures of bringing the film in under budget created a feeling of nervousness and tension among crew members. They saw the director leaping and screaming and noted his excitement around the special effects. One soundman heard Landis rave at the powder chief because the flames shooting from the burning cross weren’t big enough. During the flame gag some in the crew felt that the director dangerously prolonged the flames leaping from McLarty’s sheets. Another incident, involving six bloodhounds used in a “tracking scene,” had the dog handlers very upset. The incident occurred after Landis’ 1st assistant, Elie Cohn, was told by one of the handlers, Terry Knapp, that the dogs, being gun-shy, would react badly to any gun fire over their heads. Cohn went over to Landis, it appeared, to convey to the director the handler’s concern. He then came back to tell Knapp that she needn’t worry. The filming that night climaxed with a chase of Vic by noose-waving Klansmen, barking bloodhounds, flaming torches, blasting shotguns and fiercely brandished clubs. When the shooting started the deafening noise went straight to the animals’ heads; the dogs broke into yowling panic and it was some time before their angry handlers managed to get them back under control. Vic Morrow ran straight for the pond in the blue suit of Bill.

Everything would be ready for the filming of the crucial scenes in five days’ time. Only the roles of the two children, which Lucy Fisher and John Landis had introduced into the script to soften Bill, were not yet filled as Fenton & Feinberg, the agency which cast all four segments of the TZ movie, balked at the plan to hire the kids illegally. The agency came recommended to Landis by Frank Marshall, who had used them on E.T. and Poltergeist. Some of the roles were easily filled by the director’s friends like propman Milgrom, or Sue Dugan, the women’s wardrobe supervisor who played the waitress, or Peter Aykroyd, Dan Aykroyd’s brother, who played a GI. For the part which eventually went to Vic Morrow, Peter Coyote, who played a leading role in E.T., had initially auditioned, along with Glenn Campbell. Just three days before this session John Landis had completed his third script that put together for the first time the fatal elements of the helicopter, the explosives and children in one scene, and he asked the two casting agents if they could provide two Vietnamese children 6-7 years old. “Landis was taking great joy and pride in the explosions,” Marci Liroff recalled, “how it would be so exciting and wonderful and great.” Marci knew that a studio welfare worker was required to be on the set with the children and that no welfare worker in his right mind would allow a child to be put anywhere near explosives. During the rest of the afternoon Marci continued casting. She saw several people for the Nazi roles; she hired a Vietnam veteran to play a G.I.; she saw a possible bar patron and a KKK. She considered three possible candidates for Bill, writing on her Fenton-Feinberg casting sheet under one, “too young,” under the other, “liked,” and under the third, “looks great.” At 4:30 she saw her last candidate of the day, a woman trying out for waitress; Marci noted, “liked a lot.” At the bottom of the casting sheet for June 16, she made her own handwritten note of John Landis’ request: Two Vietnamese kids. Boy!Girl (Chinese or Korean, Thai, two nights). Marci Liroff was one of the few people engaged in the TZ production who worked on all of its four segments.

Her ultimate supervisor was the film’s executive producer Frank Marshall. Sometime after her session with Landis she called Marshall and communicated her concern about the director’s dangerous and “crazy” scheme to hire children without a studio/ welfare worker. George Folsey Jr. first raised the idea of hiring the children illegally to his good friend Donna Schuman after she asked to see Landis’ newly revised script. The director’s decision not to go through ordinary casting shifted the burden to Folsey who, by his own account, was the “problem-solver and trouble-shooter” in his relationship with the young director. “John’s written two kids into the Vietnamese section and we’re going to have to work them without permits and a welfare worker,” Donna recalled Folsey telling her, “and we don’t want that information getting out, especially in the light of the explosives and all the stuff that’s going on.” Folsey told Donna they thought that some insert and reaction shots of a couple of “adorable” kids would do it. Among the first persons Folsey canvassed was a young gofer in the office with the LA melting-pot name of Carolyn Lee-Epstein. Of Asian extraction, she heard Folsey ask her if she knew of any “oriental children that we can use” while driving him to pick up his Rolls-Royce at a mechanic’s garage in the Valley. When she replied in the negative, she was surprised at Folsey’s cautious, “Well, we have to be careful about this.” As Folsey soon discovered, going to the streets to cast the children’s roles was not as easy as Landis had made it sound. He managed to meet with few Asian families. He had better luck at a grammar school in one of LA’s predominantly Asian neighborhoods and with the help of Beverly Mason, principal of the Elysian Heights Elementary School, Folsey was put in touch with Julie Hua, a Vietnamese mother of two. Mrs. Hua lived across the street from the school where her two children attended. She was a sort of ombudswoman for the Indochinese community in the neighborhood. Her husband, a lieutenant-colonel in the former South Vietnamese army, was still in Vietnam, presumably in a Communist jail. Mrs. Hua had worked for the U.S. Embassy in Saigon as a translator-interpreter until the fall of Saigon. Like Dr. Daniel Le, she used to watch Combat on the U.S. Armed Forces Network in Vietnam and was a fan of Vic Morrow.

When Folsey called on the family he found there not only Mrs. Hua’s two children but also the four children of her sister. Folsey suggested they all visit the set and meet the director. And so, the following night, July 15, Folsey created a sensation on the rundown street by pulling up in a limo. The children were packed in the limo with Folsey and the Huas, while the rest followed in a car driven by Mrs. Hua’s brother-in-law. Mrs. Hua was not worried. She had Folsey’s assurance that there would be no danger other than that the kids might get a little wet. He had promised to have “plenty of hot chocolate and heaters on the set.” She told investigators that Folsey had asked her not to talk about the hiring of the kids yet; they were still trying to get the permits, he told her. In the end her own children, Vinh and Richard, were not chosen; the director picked two of her sister’s kids. But three days later, on Sunday, July 18, Mrs. Hua received a call and heard the voice which she remembered because of its distinct high-pitched straining sound. It was George Folsey Jr. breaking the news, ”in a very low, sorry voice.” The director had found two smaller and lighter children that could be carried more easily by Vic Morrow. Folsey held out the promise that maybe he could get her kids into another set and mentioned that he would come by and drop off some money for her trouble. He reminded Mrs. Hua of the day and the date of the shooting of the scene with the kids, and that they still might need to use her sister’s two twin girls if the two smaller children couldn’t act. In the end it was through his assistant, “flash,” Donna Schuman’s husband, Dr. Harold Schuman, that Folsey managed to find the right people who wanted to have their kids in a movie. Hal Schuman had done favors for film people before. He once authorized a Vitamin B-12 shot for TV star Brenda Vacarro. He taught Shirley McLaine how to use a yo-yo. More recently he had helped out George Folsey Jr. in getting an R-rating changed on an MGM movie, Norman, Is That You?, which dealt explicitly with homosexuality; writing in his capacity as psychiatrist to the Motion Picture Rating Board, Dr. Schuman successfully lobbied for a less restrictive rating. He continued to be helpful in Folsey’s latest film. Hollywood was calling. Who could resist?

He continued to be helpful in Folsey’s latest film. Hollywood was calling. Who could resist? Dr. Schuman was in charge of a community mental health center which at one time employed eight Asian staff members. On Monday, July 12, barely ten days before the film’s scheduled wrap, he made a number of phone calls to his Asian friends, telling them in brief the little he knew about the film. He first called a Korean colleague, but she wasn’t in. His last call was to Dr. Peter Chen. Dr. Schuman first thanked him for an earlier favor in which Dr. Chen had referred him to an acupuncturist for his back trouble. He then mentioned that his wife worked for a movie company and that the film they were making called for two “oriental” children. Chen thereupon contacted his brother Mark who told him that his sixyear-old daughter Renee would be interested in the girl’s role. He knew another family, the Les, whose son sounded perfect for the male part. Peter Chen told investigators that subsequently he contacted Dr. Daniel Le and his wife Kim. Dr. Le, Myca’s father, called Dr. Schuman back to ask if his 71/2 -year-old son could be in the movie. Dr. Le reminded Dr. Schuman that the psychiatrist had already met Myca one time before at a New Year’s party earlier that year. Three days later, on July 15, Schuman again called Peter Chen, advising him that the producer, John Landis, would like to see the children. And the following morning Folsey personally spoke to Renee’s grandfather, Mao Chen, as well as to Dr. Daniel Le. They were informed that a car would come that same evening around 5:30 to take the children and their parents to meet the director on the set. That day Cynthia Nigh gave the addresses of the kids’ families to driver Jeff Powell. Later that same day a studio van arrived promptly, first at the home of the Chens in Pasadena and then at the Les in Cerritos. On Friday, July 16, driver Jeff Powell drove the thrilled occupants back to the set at Franklin Canyon where Folsey introduced himself. Awed by the extraordinary experience of being on a Hollywood set, the Asian families were introduced to Vic Morrow.

Folsey explained to the parents and children the shot to be filmed the following week. Using pidgin English, he spoke of a “big light” that would go on “making loud noise.” The noise, he explained, would be created “by Vic stepping on wood objects under water.” There was no mention of explosions or bombs, the helicopter wasn’t mentioned, only “lights and sounds.” Folsey then took them to meet the longhaired, bearded director. Landis was in a hurry. He looked at the serious little boy and at the pretty little girl, and seeing they were smaller and lighter than the Hua children for Vic to carry, with his quick decision, ”Good, hire them, “the fate of Myca and Renee was sealed. The van would come to their homes on Wednesday, July 21. They were to bring along some warm clothing. Folsey reminded Mrs. Le and Mr. Chen that they would be paid $500 each. “Look, there’s a feeling that these guys want to show one another that they can make the biggest best film for the least money,” House recalled Allingham telling him. The UPM continued, “You’re making a picture that’s going to be next to a Steven Spielberg picture – both guys are obviously very competitive.” Both Landis after Blues Brothers and Spielberg after 1941 had been called “terribly indulgent” following the failure of these big expensive films. Allingham told the 2nd AD that it was kind of a contest to make the best TZ segment as cheaply as they could for around $1.3 million. What he learned from Allingham somehow failed to reassure the 2nd AD and he never stopped looking for substitutes in place of real children in scene 31. He had just worked under such conditions. During his recent stint on E.T., he had seen “small people” hanging around the set and he told Allingham about them. Further researching the idea of using “small people” for the kids’ roles he tried to interest Allingham in using “professional small people,” adults small enough to appear as children. House mentioned Little Bobby Porter who had doubled for the little girl in Annie. Though Allingham told him not to worry about it, House continued his attempts to find a realistic substitute for the kids. He kept wondering if the children could swim. But at the time of the Friday night, July 16, shooting of the KKK sequences at Franklin Canyon, House received a clear signal that all his suggestions concerning professional small people, dummies and stunt doubles had fallen on", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634243667_cleaned.txt:148:33cbedfca0c7", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 1752, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634243667_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634243667", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634243667_cleaned", "chunk_index": 149, "text": "mentioned Little Bobby Porter who had doubled for the little girl in Annie.

But at the time of the Friday night, July 16, shooting of the KKK sequences at Franklin Canyon, House received a clear signal that all his suggestions concerning professional small people, dummies and stunt doubles had fallen on deaf ears. Spotting the “oriental” children on the KKK set, oblivious of their fate as they waited to be interviewed, he was confronted with the absolute reality of the scheme. And in a last-ditch effort Andy House resolved to make a final bold attempt to convince John Landis that the plan should be changed. Following the lunch break he found himself walking back to the set with his immediate superior Elie Cohn. John Landis walked slightly ahead of them. Again, House expressed his fears to Cohn that by using children illegally not only could John Landis himself be banned from working with children in the future but also that Warner Brothers, the entire studio, could have its license revoked to work with any children at all in the state of California. On Monday, July 19, at a meeting at Indian Dunes attended by Folsey, Allingham and Elie Cohn, John Landis discussed the plan to have the children on the set without a permit or welfare worker. To avoid detection the children would be brought to Indian Dunes on the last day of shooting and their presence there, the director stressed, would be as short as possible. Hiring the children had not been part of Allingham’s deal making, but he became a key figure in the aftermath; for with the final decision to shoot Vic and the kids he was faced two days later with the task of coming up with the cash to pay the parents of the children. There was no problem about the petty cash since that was in the custody of his girlfriend, Cynthia Nigh, whom he had himself hired to work in the office. But Folsey and Allingham, after asking her how much petty cash she had on hand for the kids, finally decided not to dip into these reserves and to get the money through the production’s ordinary channels. The person Allingham went to see was Bonnie Radford, the chief accountant on the TZ production. Although she worked for Warner and was paid by Warner, Warner’s regular fulltime employees identified her as part of the “Spielberg organization.” As paymaster on E.T. and Poltergeist, she had worked directly with Frank Marshall and she also handled the payroll for Raiders of the Lost Ark. Bonnie’s sister, Mary Radford, was also part of the Spielberg organization and was Frank Marshall’s special assistant.

Bonnie’s sister, Mary Radford, was also part of the Spielberg organization and was Frank Marshall’s special assistant. According to one of Warner’s internal memos, Bonnie Radford had been assigned by Marshall and Spielberg to work on the Landis segment; she was responsible for all the paperwork to back up checks. Before funding a request, it was her practice to generate a check and have either the Landis production personnel or Frank Marshall sign it. Once a check was ready for issuance, she prepared the necessary documentation to be sent over to Jim Henderling, Warner’s payroll watchdog. Henderling had to co-sign any checks for amounts over $500 . Of all the people on the Landis segment, Radford’s most frequent dealings were with Dan Allingham. The UPM sent her bills to be paid or made requests for funds. On July 20, a Tuesday, the day before the scheduled final shooting, Allingham came to Bonnie Radford with a request for $2, 000 in cash, and a transaction took place the true details of which have never been unraveled. The often-changing and conflicting statements made since by key Warner people over the five-year period of TZ proceedings have served only to complicate this apparently unsolvable mystery. However, the true story was contained in a confidential internal Warner memo which never came to light during or after the trial. The memo contrasted sharply with what certain Warner people would later testify to under oath. Written immediately after the accident, it revealed that Henderling stated that he was explicitly approached by Bonnie Radford on how to pay the children “under the table.” Jim Henderling, at 75 almost as old as the Hollywood film industry, had grown small and wizened in the more than half century spent working for the studios. Ancient and hard-nosed, a notorious stickler, he was known to return any document if it had initials rather than a full signature. He was a fine-detail man, responsible for monitoring the day-to-day production paperwork – the call sheets, shooting schedules and the daily poop sheet. The studio put him over John Landis whose reputation for keeping within budget had suffered since Blues Brothers. For a brief period, in order to be even closer to Landis, Henderling departed from his routine and together with Bonnie Radford occupied a trailer on the Universal lot. A confidential Warner memo connecting the studio with the child-hiring scandal showed that Henderling had spoken to Bonnie Radford in the final days of shooting about the employment of the children. During that conversation Henderling recalled that", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634243667_cleaned.txt:150:b2e0cd5f2f9e", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 1754, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634243667_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634243667", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634243667_cleaned", "chunk_index": 151, "text": "over John Landis whose reputation for keeping within budget had suffered since Blues Brothers.

A confidential Warner memo connecting the studio with the child-hiring scandal showed that Henderling had spoken to Bonnie Radford in the final days of shooting about the employment of the children. During that conversation Henderling recalled that he learned from Radford that the Landis people, particularly George Folsey Jr., had some kids that they wanted to use and that they wanted to know how they could pay them “under the table.” Leaving Radford’s request unresolved, he took it up with his boss Ed Morey. Morey at first opposed the “under the table” plan and sent Henderling back to tell Radford. Radford then spoke with Allingham and Marshall, finally drafting the check as requested. The confidential memo told of Bonnie Radford’s assistant returning later that same day with a check described as a “petty cash advance” made out to George Folsey Jr. It was issued on an account described as “Twilight Zone Productions” with a Warner Brothers Studio, Burbank, address. For Henderling there was no mistaking the purpose of the check. Though Radford informed him it was no longer for the kids but for other purposes, Henderling didn’t believe a word of it and so stated when he returned to Ed Morey bearing a $2, 000 check payable to Folsey. In fact, before he took the check to Morey, according to Warner’s internal memos, Henderling did not even bother to ask what the petty cash advance was for because he felt he already knew and there was no point in asking. He didn’t believe it for a minute when. Bonnie Radford told him they were no longer going to use the kids. According to Warner’s memos, Morey directed Henderling to sign the check because the Landis people had every right to take the advance. Henderling did as told and returned the signed check to Radford with the understanding that the exact use of the money would be accounted for at a later time. Two days before the deaths on the set the check was co-signed by Frank Marshall and sent back to Folsey. There was one last hitch. Folsey was too busy to take the check personally to the bank. But cashing a check made out to his name without personally appearing at the bank to present the required identification was no great problem. John Landis had an excellent banking connection, namely his mother. She was a minor official at the Mitsui Manufacturers Bank in Beverly Hills. Arrangements were made and a messenger promptly took the check from the Universal bungalow to Landis’ mother in Beverly Hills.

Under her initials, Shirley Levine authorized the cashing of the check to help her moviemaker son. She gave twenty $100 bills in an envelope to Folsey’s messenger, becoming herself an innocent part of his dubious scheme. The next day, studio driver Jeff Powell picked up Folsey at the Universal bungalow in Burbank. They first drove to the densely ethnic neighborhood in Echo Park where Mrs. Julie Hua, the energetic Vietnamese ombudswoman, had her home. Folsey gave her $800 in cash for the children who had auditioned, reminding her of the two who were still on stand-by until 9 o’clock that evening. Folsey waved goodbye to Mrs. Hua and to the children whom fate would spare – because they were too heavy. Then Powell drove to the homes of the Le and Chen families where they picked up Myca and Renee with their parents and transported them to Indian Dunes for what was originally planned to be the final night of shooting. It was 8 o’clock that evening when Powell arrived on the set. He remained there that night and at about seven the following morning he took the weary Le and Chen families back to their respective homes. They were to return again that same evening because the anticipated wrap had not come off and the shooting was rolled over an extra day. Having paid the two families $500 each, Folsey had obtained their promise to return Myca and Renee for one more night at the same fee. Folsey sent over the office gofer to pick up the money at Radford’s office. Carolyn Lee-Epstein was instructed that no W-2 forms would be filled out for the children. In the days leading up to the shooting she had heard frequent mention of the “oriental children” in conversations between Folsey and Allingham. She had overheard them discussing how to hide the hiring of the kids in the accounting books. She knew from talk in the office that the two kids would earn $1, 000 each, and it stuck in her mind as being “an awful lot.” From the Universal bungalow to Bonnie Radford’s office at Warner was a ten-minute drive. Donna Schuman was present in Folsey’s office at the bungalow around mid-afternoon when the gofer returned from Radford’s office with a brown envelope containing the $1, 000 in $100 bills.

But the talk was never treated seriously. For public relations reasons the director was reported by his lawyers to be under a doctor’s care; meanwhile, he continued working on his segment. Despite the funerals, NTSB and legal rap sessions with Harland Braun, Joel Behr, John Diemer and Marty Rose, the director rushed his segment to completion in order to move on to new projects. Holed up in his Universal bungalow editing room with Folsey and film editor Malcolm Campbell, the reportedly despondent director completed editing the film within two weeks after the crash. By meeting the deadlines Landis preserved his right to have “final cut” on his segment as guaranteed in his agreement with Spielberg and Warner. The deaths had very little impact on either the Landis segment’s budget or Warner’s release date because all of the segment had been shot by the time the tragedy occurred. Folsey and Landis initially discussed using some of the footage from the crash scene in the final version but in the end decided it was the wrong thing to do. Ironically, with the alltoo-real realism of the exploding village necessarily cut, Landis’ finished segment left the script’s story line where it had been before Lucy Fisher intervened and John Landis began his revisions to make Bill more human. Since Bill never completes his redemption by rescuing the children, he ends the segment fundamentally “unsoftened,” unchanged, unregenerate, “unredeemed,” the same cartoon-like character from the first script. Consequently, the artistic basis on which John Landis in Vic’s eulogy tried to justify the actor’s death ended up on the cutting-room floor. Those who met with him daily, his closest personal friends and his personal secretary, felt he showed no evidence of remorse. While the director edited the film, Alpha Campbell was disgusted by the business-as-usual atmosphere in the bungalow. It seemed to her as though everybody in command acted as if nothing had happened. It bothered her that Landis behaved as if unaffected by the tragedy. Donna Schuman, too, was revolted to see how quickly everybody forgot their unhallowed part in the event.

George Folsey Jr. remained unresponsive to her husband’s request to meet with him and give an explanation. Donna herself felt that the basic questions she had concerning the accident had never been answered. She was aware that Folsey’s exclamation over lunch at Hampton’s a couple of days earlier, “We rehearsed it thirty times!,” was a crock. Donna Schuman grew more and more infuriated, but before her final break with Folsey could take place she needed a last straw. It was shortly forthcoming when Folsey innocently asked her to type up a form. It was an application for admission to the Jonathan Club, one of Los Angeles’ most prestigious private clubs, still barred at that time to women, blacks and Jews. While publicly the young director gave the impression that buried in movie making he had left behind a painful episode in his life, he was actually very busy privately talking about the case. In an effort to recruit friendly forces immediately following the disaster Landis held highly confidential meetings with several eyewitnesses from the set, including 1st AD Elie Cohn, propman Mike Milgrom and set designer Richard Sawyer. Apart from the many hours spent in planning sessions with his personal lawyer Joel Behr, Landis directed his legal team into gaining an understanding of his role on the set that night so that a defense strategy could be mobilized. In the first months following the tragedy that strategy was limited by what he himself knew about the causes of the crash. What Landis believed had happened came mostly from his lawyers and newspapers. At first, like the government investigators, he believed that a glue pot lid carelessly left in one of the huts, specifically the drying hut nearest the action, was responsible for knocking out the chopper’s tail rotors. His talks with key eyewitnesses had led him to conclude, he informed his legal team, that the burly special effects man standing next to him, Jerry Williams, had fired the fatal shot. During these conferences with his inner circle, Landis showed a cockiness unknown to the public. In confidential discussions within weeks of the crash he told his lawyers that, according to early news accounts, the NTSB investigators had only confiscated five of the six angles being shot that night. They missed the footage from the sixth camera, vital footage still in his possession. Arrogantly, Landis dismissed them as being “stupid” for not knowing the difference.

They missed the footage from the sixth camera, vital footage still in his possession. Arrogantly, Landis dismissed them as being “stupid” for not knowing the difference. Landis wanted his team of lawyers to know a little more about John Landis. He led them into the labyrinth of his persona, smugly admitting that he was sometimes viewed on the set as “intimidating,” explaining that it was the way a movie director got results. Many of the craftsmen working on his set were prima donnas, he said, “emotionally disturbed.” He asserted in his defense how “intimidation” was only one tool and that sometimes, to be effective, it had to be alternated with “seduction.” He set himself above Steven Spielberg, his partner and co-producer on the TZ movie, expressing the rivalry and envy he felt for Spielberg that ultimately lay behind his drive for the spectacular which brought disaster on their heads. To his team of lawyers, he described himself as a “classic liberal Jew.” He boasted that in contrast to Spielberg, all of his movies were racially integrated. As he vaunted his advanced liberal views, he berated Steven Spielberg who in E.T., according to Landis, should have had a black kid in the bicycle scene. The director assured his listeners that such a lack of racial sensitivity would never occur to him. In these sometimes-bizarre defense planning sessions Landis took the position of infallibility. He portrayed himself as a martyr, a “rich boy” hounded by the envious. Strangely, he was able to speak almost casually of the events of that night, even joking about it now and then. On one occasion, pressed by his attorneys as to why he took so much time and trouble to keep smoking off his set by writing it on the call sheets, the implication being that there might have been safety issues on the set in need of equal attention, Landis sarcastically asked his attorneys what they expected. Should he write as a caution, “Don’t Kill Anyone, Please?” Some of his legal advisers appreciated from the start that there were problems with the case. They were especially bothered by Landis’ assertion that it was not the director’s task on the set to ask if anything was safe. Privately, some of his counsel felt differently. One, in particular, was troubled from the defense standpoint that Landis had never bothered to ensure that the pilot and special effects chief Paul Stewart met to discuss the shot. Landis wasn’t even sure if Stewart was actually watching during the so-called “rehearsal” at 2 : 00 A.M. ., just twenty minutes before the crash!

But perhaps most disturbing was his admission that he knew the fatal shot was “dangerous.” He screamed to the crowd through his bullhorn to stand up during the final take. That, if nothing else, showed foreseeability. While busy consulting with his lawyers and putting the final touches to his TZ segment in the early fall of ‘82, John Landis experienced the ups and downs of a busy career. The other project he had been committed to during the shooting of his Twilight Zone segment, a film project entitled “Whereabouts,” collapsed as a result of the disaster at Indian Dunes. But this disappointment was followed by landing a comedy which by the time of its release would become the immensely successful Trading Places, a stroke brought about through his connections at Paramount with Jeffrey Katzenberg, then Paramount’s second in command to Michael Eisner. The original name of the comedy was “Black and White” and it was initially scheduled to be directed by someone other than Landis. Katzenberg, according to Landis’ closest associates, “slipped” a copy of the script to him as a way of helping out a friend in trouble. Producer Aaron Russo had originally thought of Richard Pryor and Gene Wilder in the lead roles, but Pryor literally couldn’t be found, and without Pryor, Wilder wouldn’t come in. Russo next thought of pairing Dan Aykroyd and Eddie Murphy. Landis’ agent, Mike Marcus, called Russo and said that his client wanted to direct the movie. Russo had produced The Rose with Bette Midler; he had been impressed by Animal House and shortly after the crash, during lunch at the Paramount commissary with Katzenberg and Landis, the New York producer heard Landis enthusiastically promise that he could deliver Aykroyd: “He’s a very dear friend of mine.” The female lead in the film was originally going to be a black girl. John Landis, however, wanted Jamie Lee Curtis and so the “classic liberal Jew” who chided Spielberg for not having a little black boy on a bicycle changed the role to a white. It was a break for Jamie Lee Curtis. “It took her from being an exploitation film star,” Russo said, “into legitimate movies.” Meanwhile, on a much more prosaic front, far from high-stakes Hollywood wheeling and deal-making, a virtual army of investigators was finished poring over the stricken set in the Newhall desert scrub.

Apart from the NTSB’s Don Llorente, the most notable investigator was the tall, gangling, sandy-haired sheriff ’s detective with the brushy tough-guy mustache by the name of Tom Budds. Between other assignments, Budds plowed away on the case. Speaking to people he could reach, he put their disparate observations in his notebooks. Driver Carl Pittman mentioned that he had smelled marijuana on the set and that a couple of people there “were flying high on cocaine.” From soundman Richard Goodman, who was married to script girl Katherine Wooten’s sister, Budds learned that some of the crew knew there was a “teacher” on the set, and that the crew members had been urged not to conduct any conversation about the children. Director of photography Steve Larner gave him an indication of the size of the blast by recounting how at the last minute he had to pull his jacket over his head because it got too hot near the village. But illuminating as these jottings were, they raised many more questions which could be answered only by people from whom Budds found himself effectively debarred. Chief of his sources at this stage were the other investigative agencies, each with its particular area of interest: the labor commissioner with its focus on kids, Cal/OSHA with its focus on safety, and the NTSB with its interest limited to the actual aircraft. After reading some of the original NTSB statements, Budds in his notes revealed his bewilderment: “Did director ask you to have a camera focus on center hut?” “Presentation of Morrow to crew and gallery – why? What was reason.” “Any conversation with anyone regarding danger and kids?” “Who put explosives in hut?” “Did Landis tell someone else to plant hut explosive after advisement of danger by Paul Stewart?…” Budds focused on the SFX crew since they were the only men on the set who knew which wires connected with which explosives and which firing board was manned by which powderman. He was able to establish that Jimmy Camomile and Jerry Williams had been the only two powdermen firing the mortars. But their stories were at odds and did not match the version of the chief powderman, Paul Stewart. In his very first interview with Stewart one week after the crash the powder chief told the deputy sheriff, “Landis knew where all the charges were placed,” though admitting that it was his, Stewart’s, idea to place explosives in the vital shoreline drying hut which investigators first suspected in bringing down", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634243667_cleaned.txt:157:d997c71702b5", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 1761, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634243667_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634243667", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634243667_cleaned", "chunk_index": 158, "text": "Jerry Williams had been the only two powdermen firing the mortars.

In an interview a week later Jimmy Camomile recalled for Budds that it had been Stewart’s idea to put a charge in one of the shoreline huts and that, as a result, Camomile dug in a “round, straight wall mortar … under a floor of 1” dia (sic) bamboo pieces.” Kevin Quibell told Budds, “I thought the one in the hut was square but in talking since I hear it was round.” These inconsistencies and contradictions kept Budds in a fog with only here and there a few clear patches. Budds’ notes reflected a clear patch as to who cued the action that lowered the chopper into its fatal proximity with the SFX explosives. He accepted at face value the statements made by three eyewitnesses regarding what was soon to become the most controversial issue in the first phase of the case. Powderman Quibell recalled, “Landis was holding a bullhorn and was waving the chopper lower.” Makeup artist Melanie Levitt said she saw Landis “motioning copter down with thumbs down.” Cynthia Nigh also told Budds that Landis “was saying bring copter lower and waving his arms in a lowering motion.” Though Warner’s top men, including Chairman Bob Daly and President Terry Semel, were already briefed on the answers to these questions, Homicide’s Budds remained in the fog. The one individual that Budds tried to get hold of to perhaps shed light came from the management end of the set that night, 2nd AD Andy House. Surprisingly, the NTSB had failed to interview him and the labor commission’s investigator, Charlie Hughes, had reached a dead end in – his efforts. Concerned about the legal implications of talking to the labor investigator, the 2nd AD went straight to Warner. Warner’s lawyers, notably O’Melveny & Myers’ top litigator, William Vaughn, debriefed House, and apparently fearing that his evasion from police would create more problems for the embattled studio, surreptitiously helped arrange a highly controlled meeting with Budds. The meeting between Budds and House took place on August 18, barely a month after the crash, in House’s attorney’s office, whose fees were paid by Warner. Budds did not know that the 2nd AD had already related to the Warner attorneys the details of the plan to cover-up the presence of the kids on the set and had further agreed, through consultations between his own attorney and the studio’s, not to reveal the", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634243667_cleaned.txt:158:fb6423d5e3f5", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 1762, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634243667_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634243667", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634243667_cleaned", "chunk_index": 159, "text": "a highly controlled meeting with Budds.

For if the account of any one person could be said to have fueled the studio’s concerns it would probably be that of the 2nd AD’s, Andy House. Anderson House was the first to tell Warner the shocking story of conspiracy and intrigue a mere 11 days after the crash. Andy House at the time felt he had little choice. Things were closing in. The reckoning in the form of an official interview became inevitable. Charlie Hughes was chasing him. Andy loved the film-making business and feared losing his ability to work with children. Should it ever come to a legal contest he needed the support of his employer. As a 2nd assistant director, according to the DGA basic agreement, the studio was responsible for attorney’s fees to defend him against claims stemming from his work on the set. In his predicament Warner provided the only protection he could turn to. The studio assured Anderson House that whatever he said would not go beyond the ears of a few at Warner who needed to know, specifically Terry Semel, the president, and John Daley, the chairman. Though he told the basic story of the kids on the set, House left out much of the sordid detail. For instance, he mentioned that on the final night of shooting the kids were kept in Landis’ trailer until needed; but he made no mention of the elaborate plan to prevent the FSOs, and particularly Jack Tice, from seeing the kids on the set next to explosives. From House, Warner learned something of the role of Jack Tice, the fireman/ welfare worker, and how Andy recognized him and warned Folsey, Allingham and Cohn that Tice would do something if he discovered the children. The 2nd AD went on to assure the studio lawyers that he was certain that the fire marshal was never able to spot the kids. Andy’s personal involvement in the scheme was laid out in the account he gave the studio about the way in which the children were kept concealed; in other ways, how Allingham had told him to omit references to the children from film documentation and Andy’s admission that he had himself instructed DGA apprentice Hilary Leach to do the same on the production reports for the last two days of shooting.

The studio obtained intimate details of conditions on the set that night from the beginning, when Andy House ran into Tice, until the end, when House saw Frank Marshall order everybody to go home. All this it knew before deputy sheriff Budds had ever learned of the importance of House. His listeners obtained a sense of the emotional impact on House. The 2nd AD recalled the boy crying in the water just before the 9:30 scene. He repeated his personal warnings to Allingham that Morrow’s dropping a child could cause a drowning. He told the Warner lawyers of finding Morrow face down, picking him up and dropping him when he realized he was dead. They learned of details such as the bullhorn on which investigators would soon fix their curious attention. And while listening to this bleak recital they probably were somewhat relieved to discover that House knew nothing about the rumor the studio had heard that Spielberg interviewed the children on the TZ set a week before the crash. Though never verified, this rumor was persistent and permutations of it were still current at the time of the trial. At the end of the meeting with House, Warner’s men appeared most concerned about labor investigator Hughes. So far House had been able to rebuff Hughes three times, but under the circumstances the studio advised House to see him. Warner’s outside lawyers from O’Melveny and Myers, William Vaughn and Scott Dunham, suggested that House be accompanied by his own attorney rather than one from O’Melveny & Myers. It did not want House to be identified with the movie company. Dellaverson, in discussing with Warner the scope of the interview he anticipated with the two detectives, laid down ground rules for their talk with Andy House. If the police went into certain sensitive areas, Dellaverson pledged, he would end the interview. He would only permit questions pertaining to the cause of the crash. Warner was assured that the interview would be kept short. Dellaverson promised the studio that he would report back to its lawyers following the interview. At this first meeting with the detectives Andy House was not nearly as candid as he had been with Warner. House told Budds and Finnigan nothing about the cover-up regarding the kids. He remained quiet about his fear of danger on the set.

He remained quiet about his fear of danger on the set. While describing his job responsibilities as coordinating things on the set, he omitted mention of his fudging the documents to leave the kids’ names off, of the concealment of the children in the trailer, of the code words that were used on the set, nor of his own repeated pleas not to use the kids, virtually begging Landis, Allingham and Cohn to use dummies or stunt doubles. But most poignantly, Andy House never told the police how “upset” he was every time he reviewed the script with its frightening mention of the use of explosives around children. House told the detectives that he had viewed the final footage. Budds had also seen it at the NTSB screening and now learned that House was the “mystery” man in the orange shirt, the figure Budds had watched on the film footage run to Morrow’s headless torso. But on other points, by being vague and unemphatic, House remained a “mystery man.” Asked by Budds about the 11:30 scene, he said that he had overheard complaints that it was ”hot” – no more. He didn’t tell them the explosions frightened him. He did acknowledge having seen live ammo being used and that he had seen Landis and Paul Stewart standing in the river together prior to the final crash scene. However, he said nothing about hearing any conversation between them. All in all, House told the police very little. He passed over mention of the secret code name, key to the unravelment of much of the frenzied doings on the set that night. Not until nine months had gone by, and only as the result of delicate negotiations between his lawyer and the DA’s office, would House finally reveal the outrageous story behind the “Vietnamese.” When just weeks after the crash he entered this meeting with Andy House, Budds had little or no experience in Hollywood affairs. Budds was just another young cop in the sheriff ’s Homicide division. Faced with the closed world of Hollywood, he was predictably ineffective in establishing the contacts necessary to move the investigation forward. The people who had been on the set that night, like Andy House, were afraid to speak. They wanted to continue working in Hollywood. Elsewhere Budds found doors closed to him or only opened after difficulty. Though he tried he failed, for instance, to track down the course of the actual film from the time it disappeared from the Indian Dunes set until surfacing at Warner three days later.

Of the other evidence that melted away into the night before Budds’ arrival at Indian Dunes, one of the two soundtracks that recorded the final shot not only went undiscovered by the young sheriff, it vanished so utterly that he did not even suspect its existence! Except for a few witnesses at the NTSB who had spoken out to the press like Lydecker, especially informative, Budds found, on the subject of Landis’ style of using “intimidation” on the set, making people do things they didn’t want to do, not a single person on the set that night came forward to tell police what they had seen. The big breakthrough in the case, in fact, would not come from Budds’ frustrating efforts but as the result of the eventual confession of Andy House, long after his first meeting with Budds. While Budds floundered in the fog, entertainment attorney Joel Behr was putting in place a far-reaching effort to protect John Landis and his associates, Folsey and Allingham. In anticipation of the lawsuits to be filed shortly by the victims’ heirs, Martin Rose of Kern & Wooley, the highpriced Century City insurance lawyers, got extremely busy. Rose became a member of the frequent sessions conducted in the office of Behr, the lynx-eyed general who led the phalanx, coolly weighing every stratagem under his bouffant-like shock of steel-blue hair. Each of the specialists hired by Behr practiced law in a limited area and each had specific objectives. Braun regularly touched base with his former colleagues in the DA’s office, as well as with Budds at Homicide and with Doug Dalton, the outside criminal specialist hired by O’Melveny for the studio’s potential criminal involvement in the matter; and with Andy Peterson, the lawyer and labor specialist who monitored the labor commissioner and Cal/OSHA. The first civil lawsuit, filed shortly after the crash by the lawyers for the Chen family, asked for $200 million in damages; those filed on behalf of Vic’s two daughters and Myca were soon to follow for what were expected to be equally astronomical amounts. As a result, Martin Rose, Behr’s yuppyish aircraft specialist lawyer, in October 1982 hired an insurance investigator by the name of Robert Frasco, best known outside of Hollywood for investigative work designed to help minimize insurance claims. They met at Kern & Wooley, the aircraft law specialists in Century City, where in his office Rose outlined to Frasco", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634243667_cleaned.txt:162:dbc74295f545", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 1766, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634243667_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634243667", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634243667_cleaned", "chunk_index": 163, "text": "filed on behalf of Vic’s two daughters and Myca were soon to follow for what were expected to be equally astronomical amounts. As a result, Martin Rose, Behr’s yuppyish aircraft specialist lawyer, in October 1982 hired an insurance investigator by the name of Robert Frasco, best known outside of Hollywood for investigative work designed to help minimize insurance claims. They met at Kern & Wooley, the aircraft law specialists in Century City, where in his office Rose outlined to Frasco the case as it related to their client. By the time of the trial, almost 5 years later, the private investigator compiled a sensational notebook with tape recorded interviews with the most important figures in the case. Frasco’s job, by querying witnesses among the crew and staff that night on the set, was to determine which of them perceived Landis as being responsible for safety there. What Martin Rose hoped to show was that there was a shared responsibility and that John Landis had properly followed the law by relying on experts. The problem, Rose told Frasco, was with why the helicopter was lined up over the explosives on the village shoreline instead of “where it rehearsed at 2 o’clock.” Frasco was also asked to find out who among the pool of actual eyewitnesses had heard him say “lower, lower,” if, in fact, Landis had given this command. Rose wanted Frasco to see as many witnesses from the set as possible, particularly Steve Lydecker, who was believed to be the source of all the unfavorable press leaks; Frasco was to “test people to find out what they’re going to say” and to discover how many people shared Lydecker’s feelings about the disaster. “They were afraid of the same,” Frasco surmised. One of Frasco’s most critical assignments dealt with the original design of the Vietnam village scene. Rose wanted to prove that the helicopter was not intended to be over the village when the explosions were detonated. The set designer, Richard Sawyer, was “very friendly to Landis,” Rose assured Frasco, who was instructed to contact Sawyer and “keep him friendly,” and learn what he had shown Landis in the way of sketches and drawings depicting the village scenes. Richard Sawyer had turned over to Landis’ attorneys bundles of artists’ renderings produced by his staff. Particularly worrisome to the phalanx were several sketches, Rose told his investigator, “with the helicopter sketched in the air.” Frasco was asked to believe Landis’ claim never to have seen many of the sketches and never to have approved any sketch that placed a helicopter over the village or its shoreline – ”or even over the water.” The movie director had already told the NTSB panel that he couldn’t remember any blueprints showing the planned final scene, mentioning only to the investigators that he remembered a “few thumbnail sketches.” The sketches produced by Sawyer’s staff numbered among", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634243667_cleaned.txt:163:23ba9ef20291", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 1767, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634243667_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634243667", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634243667_cleaned", "chunk_index": 164, "text": "the air.” Frasco was asked to believe Landis’ claim never to have seen many of the sketches and never to have approved any sketch that placed a helicopter over the village or its shoreline – ”or even over the water.” The movie director had already told the NTSB panel that he couldn’t remember any blueprints showing the planned final scene, mentioning only to the investigators that he remembered a “few thumbnail sketches.” The sketches produced by Sawyer’s staff numbered among them some that were extremely revealing. One strikingly depicted a helicopter descending over the cliff at Indian Dunes and traveling along the village shoreline. A storyboard dated June 25, 1982, showed the main character running in the village, as described in Landis’ third draft, scene 32, with huts exploding behind him “one after another.” There was also the eerie sketch, the “spotting plan,” showing a crashed helicopter wreck in the water. Frasco was instructed to determine if there were witnesses who knew which of the sketches had been seen by Landis, or how many sketches had been drawn which the director had not seen, and most importantly, from the liability standpoint, the extent to which the parents had been informed of what was coming in the final scene. Most emphatically, Rose wanted to know if they had ever been shown a copy of “THE FINAL SKETCH WITH EXPLOSIVES.?” (sic) By an ironic coincidence, Frasco received this new assignment the same day, September 16, 1982, on which the NTSB requested Landis’ attorneys to turn over all of the graphic and visual materials relating to the film’s production. Specifically, the NTSB was interested in the same sketches showing the planning of the location of the explosives and the helicopter’s flight plan which Landis’ new investigator had been briefed about. This request, covering “all notes, or other writings or any scripts, any documents referring or relating to the scripts and all graphic layouts, depictions or representations,” was met by stony refusal. Except for three pages of the shooting script that Behr had turned over to Llorente within the first few weeks of the crash, the phalanx did not appear willing to share anything out of the huge cache of visual materials – sketches, storyboards, blueprints, layouts, photos, graphics and other visual tools – that figure largely in a movie’s pre-production phase. As a result of Landis’ lawyers’ uncooperative policy, a federal subpoena was issued which, by executing a rare legal maneuver in federal court, the Landis phalanx also tried to block. Finally, after a federal judge rejected Landis’ position and ordered him to comply with the subpoena and supply the NTSB with the requested documents, Marty Rose met with U.S. Attorney James Sullivan and Don Llorente, presumably to produce the documents. Marty Rose showed up with only a single graphic.

Marty Rose showed up with only a single graphic. Surprisingly, it was the same eerie “spotting plan” seen nailed to the bluff by the female guard that artist Southwell met in the dunes. The federal investigator and the law man looked in puzzlement at the large copy of the set blueprint showing the wrecked helicopter without a tail rotor, uncannily positioned in the river near the village shoreline at the spot almost exactly where the actual crash had occurred. That blueprint, Rose claimed disingenuously, was the only graphic document that fit the subpoena’s description. Harland Braun’s explanation of this bold defiance was that, with so many people already having seen this striking “wreck” diagram, Behr had decided that by not turning it over to investigators it could have blown up on them at a later time. Not until John Landis was acquitted did the sketch showing a helicopter hovering over the village shoreline finally turn up. All the while it had been deliberately withheld, along with the remaining visual materials and documents which never surfaced as a part of the on-going cover-up. Three years later, even when the DA’s office issued its own subpoenas, Landis’ phalanx again denied their existence and refused to produce them. Bundles of sketches that Tom Southwell had completed in Richard Sawyer’s garage were dematerialized into the “Twilight Zone.” The tactics of the entertainment lawyers made investigator Frasco feel the effect of a murky and ambiguous reality. It was as if he had come among people who guarded a great secret. They were mysterious, unfathomable, close-mouthed, yet occasionally indiscreet. In this wavering moral twilight, he was asked to perform services that skirted the bounds of what was strictly legal and to countenance practices to which he was unaccustomed. Typical of his experience with the phalanx was the occasion when Landis’ attorneys first learned that during his interview with the NTSB, Elie Cohn had given damaging statements indicating that the director actually shouted “lower, lower” moments before the crash. Marty Rose asked Frasco that he talk to Cohn and “help him (Cohn) out a little bit” by conveying to the 1st AD that, according to those who had already heard it, Landis’ voice was not on the film and that, moreover, other witnesses had reported that the “lower, lower” order had occurred in an earlier shot. But despite Cohn’s eagerness to cooperate with Frasco, he reiterated during his conversation with the private investigator, to the utter dismay of the director’s attorneys, that he had heard Landis “scream” that confounded", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634243667_cleaned.txt:165:783885dd115b", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 1769, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634243667_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634243667", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634243667_cleaned", "chunk_index": 166, "text": "“help him (Cohn) out a little bit” by conveying to the 1st AD that, according to those who had already heard it, Landis’ voice was not on the film and that, moreover, other witnesses had reported that the “lower, lower” order had occurred in an earlier shot. But despite Cohn’s eagerness to cooperate with Frasco, he reiterated during his conversation with the private investigator, to the utter dismay of the director’s attorneys, that he had heard Landis “scream” that confounded “lower, lower” order to the helicopter. Landis’ attorneys, particularly Joel Behr, Frasco felt, were overwhelmed by the case and appeared to be suffering from a dangerous garrison mentality. Such an atmosphere was known to breed extreme attitudes, an example of which Frasco personally experienced following one of the series of secret meetings held between Elie Cohn and Landis’ legal armada. Behr and Frasco were chatting casually in the Paramount parking lot on Melrose Ave. when Frasco noted a sudden change in Behr’s tone and heard the lawyer ask him if he could get hold of phone records showing a relationship between the NTSB’s Don Llorente and Ned Good, one of the civil attorneys representing Myca’s parents. It was Behr’s belief that Llorente pursued the case so vigorously because he had once worked for Good as an investigator 10 years before he took his job with the NTSB. Frasco felt not only that the job Behr asked him to do was completely “stupid” but that it could easily backfire, not to mention that it might cause him to lose his license. Private detective Robert Frasco enjoyed the job of doing something other than routine insurance cases. Like everybody in the city, it seemed, he had been a child actor, a short career highlighted with an appearance next to Bing Crosby in the 1934 Bells of St. Mary’s. His new role as a private detective for a famous director put him back in Hollywood. This time it was strictly behind the scenes to obtain taped interviews with witnesses in the hope that by securing their early statements they would make less effective prosecution witnesses in the event of a trial. His findings were to assist the phalanx, the lawyers of many stripes – insurance, civil, criminal and labor – engaged in Landis’ defense. But as Frasco began to dig away and his reports via Rose reached Behr and Diemer it became apparent that his results were very far from their liking. His findings reflected a consensus among the crew bitterly critical of the director’s behavior on the set that night. In his first interview–which, paradoxically, he considered incredibly successful-the subject was cameraman Steve Lydecker. In Lydecker’s criticism of the director, Frasco believed he had presented Joel Behr with a model of how the prosecution would probably pursue the case in the event of a trial. The private detective noted that Lydecker’s most", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634243667_cleaned.txt:166:c59cff3539c2", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 1770, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634243667_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634243667", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634243667_cleaned", "chunk_index": 167, "text": "that his results were very far from their liking.

In his first interview–which, paradoxically, he considered incredibly successful-the subject was cameraman Steve Lydecker. In Lydecker’s criticism of the director, Frasco believed he had presented Joel Behr with a model of how the prosecution would probably pursue the case in the event of a trial. The private detective noted that Lydecker’s most damaging statements pertained to his claim that the helicopter was not even supposed to be in his wide-angle frame for the fatal scene. Lydecker told the investigator that before the last shot Landis had told him not to worry about the position of the aircraft in his Camera B because it was to be above the top of his frame. In his report to the lawyers, Frasco underscored the significance of this finding as it related to the issue of poor planning: “WOULD NOT THE MASTER SHOT CAMERAMAN BE TOLD OF THIS CHANGE!” Behr, however, after reading the report filled with unrestrained anger and the most pointed criticism of his client, saw only an alarming indictment. Hastily summoned to a meeting in Behr’s office attended by the complete phalanx – Behr, Diemer, Braun, Rose and Peterson – Frasco sensed they felt he was a traitor because he brought bad news. As they went around the table discussing the various legal problems, Frasco could readily see the basic difference between the criminal lawyer, Harland Braun, who like himself wanted to dig up all the facts in order to defuse them, and the entertainment lawyer, Joel Behr, who, in wanting to protect the career of John Landis, judged every fact on how it would impact on his client’s reputation. “I could understand their theory,” Frasco commented, “but my job was to dig up information, whether prosecution information or defense information.” However, the entertainment lawyer was decisive and Frasco was told by Martin Rose that he should consult Behr before he talked to anybody else. Behr instructed Frasco to interview witnesses friendly to Landis, like Elie Cohn and Richard Sawyer. Behr’s assistant Diemer advised the investigator to avoid the “unfriendlies,” and instead, to “see a friend like McLarty who likes John.” Martin Rose, too, was frustrated, according to Frasco, by having to deal so closely with Joel Behr. But just when Frasco’s role became more difficult because of the restraints put upon him by Behr, the NTSB files opened up and in their pages Frasco discovered a gold mine. He decided to get copies of the statements first and then to go out and see the witnesses. Since photo copies of the material were not allowed to be made, Frasco sat in the NTSB offices and read into his tape recorder from the fascinating documents, transcribing them afterwards in his office.

Since photo copies of the material were not allowed to be made, Frasco sat in the NTSB offices and read into his tape recorder from the fascinating documents, transcribing them afterwards in his office. Frasco dictated verbatim for ten days. He simply couldn’t stop. His voice went hoarse. The NTSB Investigation into the Twilight Zone Accident answered almost every question an investigator could possibly have. It was all in the annals collected by the amazing Don Llorente. In this-volume Frasco found an answer to the question as to why the chopper lined up over the shoreline when the director had claimed it was supposed to be over the middle of the river. But though voluminous and detailed, the annals of Llorente regrettably contained very little that was not disquieting from the director’s point of view. On the whole, Frasco recalled, they gave the impression that the final scene “was a poorly planned and dangerous act.” The most astonishing part of the TZ case was the fact that everything which the sheriff and DA investigators unsuccessfully sought to uncover in years of effort was already known within days of the crash to the top executives at Warner Bros. The top echelon witnessed the crash footage mere hours after it was shot and, shortly thereafter, Warner secretly launched an inquiry that was far more effective than that of either the NTSB or the labor commissioner – and on certain key issues more comprehensive and detailed than even the district attorney’s investigation. Warner rapidly unearthed a story that would not emerge – and then only partially – for another five years at the time of the trial. The inquiry conducted by the studio immediately after the accident revealed its own possible criminal liability on charges that it had condoned the illegal hiring. It learned everything to do with the children – how originally non-existent in Landis’ first script they became a prominent part and how after their clandestine engagement they were concealed on the set. The inquiry revealed the size of the explosions and dwelt on the “near miss” during the 11:30 rage scene. The studio discovered Landis’ failure to follow standard procedures and other instances of his negligence on the set. In its investigation, Warner had the advantage of ready access to those with direct knowledge of what had actually taken place that night. They included the people who worked regularly for Warner fulltime and were “loaned out” to the Landis segment, as well as the crew hired by the Landis group for the limited purpose of filming his segment.

They included the people who worked regularly for Warner fulltime and were “loaned out” to the Landis segment, as well as the crew hired by the Landis group for the limited purpose of filming his segment. By talking to them, Warner was also able to keep tabs on the other investigations, such as those conducted by the labor commissioner or the DA. By comparison, the labor commissioner and the district attorney investigators, without compulsory process, had very little power to interview witnesses. Those who talked to the authorities did so on a strictly voluntary basis and most declined. Warner had no problem in gaining the cooperation of key people like Elie Cohn, Andy House and Richard Vane. Those on the Spielberg side assigned to the Landis segment, like Frank Marshall and Bonnie Radford, were housed on the Warner lot, and Warner’s top executives who worked on the film like Fred Gallo and Lucy Fisher, or lower-level ones like Jim Henderling and Ed Morey, were only a few doors away. Chiefly what the studio learned as the result of its efforts was the alarming extent of its own direct involvement. Within days of the crash it found out that certain of its personnel had knowledge of the “under the table” payments to the parents of the kids. Yet nothing of this privy information was reflected in Warner executive Ed Morey’s August 6 declaration to labor investigator Charlie Hughes. In his declaration aimed at distancing the studio from any knowledge of the illegal hiring, Morey admitted having spoken to Allingham on July 21 about the problem of the kids not being mentioned in the shooting schedule – but said nothing about his dealings in the byzantine scheme the day before to get the check for the illegal cash payments from Warner to the Landis people. Morey’s omission was not surprising as it would have revealed the paper trail spawned by the check with the initials “S.L” of the director’s own mother. The check was jointly signed by Jim Henderling and Frank Marshall and the Spielberg organization – through Marshall – should have known what John Landis was doing. Warner’s position was further compromised by divisions within its own ranks as to the intended use of the petty cash; Marshall and his handpicked accountant Bonnie Radford had one version, Morey and Henderling had another. A series of highly confidential internal memos showed how much the studio’s top brass really knew about their potential liability. One memo pointedly mentioned that even though director Landis had a near disaster at the 11:30 shot, he did not take any steps to improve safety. To the contrary, the memo lamented, the", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634243667_cleaned.txt:169:c2117107ccc7", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 1773, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634243667_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634243667", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634243667_cleaned", "chunk_index": 170, "text": "its own ranks as to the intended use of the petty cash; Marshall and his handpicked accountant Bonnie Radford had one version, Morey and Henderling had another. A series of highly confidential internal memos showed how much the studio’s top brass really knew about their potential liability. One memo pointedly mentioned that even though director Landis had a near disaster at the 11:30 shot, he did not take any steps to improve safety. To the contrary, the memo lamented, the evidence would show that he actually increased the danger: Testimony will indicate that Mr. Landis instructed the special effects people to put more charges in areas not known to the pilot which were in fact closer to the new position of the helicopter than previously indicated. Testimony will also show that this new position of explosives was not related to the pilot. The memo demonstrated Warner’s concern as to the extent of its exposure to liability claims. Clearly, the director’s failure in various areas of his responsibility laid Warner open to charges of outright negligence, perhaps even criminal negligence. Some at the entertainment company feared that in Hollywood’s pervasive cocaine culture Warner had reason to fear a drug fiasco. One highly confidential memo from Warner’s New York office erroneously noted that “although Mr. Landis was not seen as taking drugs during that particular sequence, he had been previously witnessed to snort cocaine at other times.” No such evidence of drug use was ever revealed in the TZ investigation. But a more obvious concern over its exposure, as reflected in these coolly business-like internal documents, was the breakdown in normal production procedures. From its inquiry Warner learned of the often bitter infighting between the Landis group and the studio’s veteran production chief Fred Gallo. The Landis people did as they pleased because, as one internal memorandum succinctly stated: The studio was also aware of the claim made by John Landis before the NTSB-certainly his most controversial – that he was not in charge of the movie set that night. Warner executives appeared skeptical that a disclaimer of this sort could hold up, considering the young director’s reputation for behaving in a domineering and intimidating manner on a movie set. A high-level confidential memo showed that at least some people at Warner did not believe this position to be tenable: During his testimony, Mr. Landis testified that he did not know who had complete control of the activities during the filming. He stated that because of union problems and union regulations he can not specifically denote who was actually in charge. However, his testimony was refuted by himself or at least weakened by the fact that subsequent to his statement of having no control he turned to one of the people present and asked them to put out his cigarette since he did not allow smoking on his set. Some at Warner", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634243667_cleaned.txt:170:5b1767a39d55", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 1774, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634243667_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634243667", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634243667_cleaned", "chunk_index": 171, "text": "had complete control of the activities during the filming.

However, his testimony was refuted by himself or at least weakened by the fact that subsequent to his statement of having no control he turned to one of the people present and asked them to put out his cigarette since he did not allow smoking on his set. Some at Warner felt that the appropriate government agencies might, according to another confidential memo, “try to use this incident as an example to the industry and may pursue a criminal prosecution Warner Brothers Inc. executive (sic).” It could reach as high as its president Terry Semel, or even the chairman John Daley. That fear was probably strengthened after Warner learned from one of its highest-ranking executives, Lucy Fisher, that Landis and Marshall and herself had jointly discussed the “problem” of using children in the Vietnam village scenes. At the same time, Warner’s confidential internal investigation raised additional questions. Had Warner been told the whole truth by the managers of the set that night? For instance, had assistant director Elie Cohn, or the location manager Richard Vane – or even Hilary Leach, the DGA apprentice – told them everything they knew? Warner’s internal investigation was a matter of corporate self-protection. As the film’s financier and distributor, the company stood to lose considerably. Besides the possible revocation of its California child labor license, it faced the likelihood – with three segments still remaining to be shot – that bad press might adversely affect the Twilight Zone release. The studio hardly wished to see its valuable Spielberg product sacrificed. Apart from the Twilight Zone venture, Warner’s next deal with the Spielberg organization would soon be brewing with a script for Gremlins to be directed by Spielberg protege Joe Dante. The studio could not afford to lose its nascent relationship with Spielberg. As the final party of responsibility, Warner Bros., knew that ultimately it would be the “deep pocket” in all the lawsuits. The studio was well aware that what it discovered of the conduct of employees on the TZ set was to broaden its exposure in the anticipated lawsuits and criminal investigations. Shuddering to think what effect this would have on the company image, the studio felt compelled to make every effort to keep the famed WB shield untarnished. Nobody worked harder on the Twilight Zone case than the junior partner of Silverman, Rosen, Leon & Behr. Colleagues described him as a “typical entertainment lawyer.” Joel Behr looked hawkish. He rarely smiled. From a long narrow head rose a wave of hair like a blue Pacific billow. Every item on his person was faultlessly in place except for the billow which seemed slightly askew.

It was a wig which towered over his hooded eyes and olive complexion. In every case where an insurance company can be expected to make huge payouts the lawyers swarm like bees. Landis’ mounting troubles meant a windfall for any of the lawyers lucky enough to get to the pot. The legal bonanza would ultimately benefit some half-dozen lawyers and cost well over $5 million in fees. Much of this was overseen by Joel Behr who soon after entering the case applied himself full-time to the stupendous job of master-minding the director’s defense. The amount of work was staggering. In the first months following the accident he orchestrated the defense of Landis, Folsey and Allingham. He assembled the phalanx. He monitored the NTSB, appearing at its proceedings with all three of his clients. Behr’s single-minded object of protecting his client stopped at nothing. When Llorente asked that Landis’ lawyers turn over certain materials, especially visual materials like sketches and photographs used in the planning or depiction of the final scene, Behr’s team denied that they even existed. It was the only time that the local federal attorney, Jim Sullivan, could remember a case in which a party did not comply with an NTSB request. The chief question requiring all of Behr’s attention was the business side of the law. It was the fundamental one in cases of the sort where “employer” and “employed” are ill-defined. Who was going to pick up the cost of the anticipated lawsuits? Warner or Landis? Who was going to pay, for instance, for the lawsuit against both already filed by the Chens? This quandary involved Behr at the start in making the pro forma demand for arrangements from Warner and its insurance company, Travelers; and as Behr’s demand did not meet with immediate approval, it resulted in the first major conflict to arise between John Landis and the studio. For, the Twilight Zone tragedy involved not only questions of moral responsibility but also of financial responsibility, the latter being preponderant and most pressing. Already as a result of the Chen lawsuit, three weeks after the crash, Landis was being subpoenaed on August 16. As any criminal action would not congeal for some time, the Chen lawsuit highlighted the importance of obtaining legal support to counter the expected civil actions. The Landis defense required two kinds of fees, criminal and civil, and according to the overall liability insurance policy Warner held, individuals would not ordinarily be covered", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634243667_cleaned.txt:172:82db3e47a3e9", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 1776, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634243667_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634243667", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634243667_cleaned", "chunk_index": 173, "text": "the latter being preponderant and most pressing.

The Landis defense required two kinds of fees, criminal and civil, and according to the overall liability insurance policy Warner held, individuals would not ordinarily be covered by Travelers in the commission of an unlawful act. This locked both Warner and Travelers as well in an internal dispute, unlike a typical accident case where there would be no question of criminal negligence. The terms of the Travelers policy clearly guaranteed legal fees for ordinary negligence claims, the so-called civil side. But the issue between the studio and the insurer was over who should pay for the criminal side, Warner, Travelers, or both. This schism reoccurred in various forms throughout the case. The question was hardly academic, for the legal fees were huge. Warner and Travelers together, in the first year alone, poured massive amounts of money into lawyers’ accounts. They paid out hundreds of thousands of dollars to Joel Behr, representing Landis, Folsey and Allingham; to Kern & Wooley’s Martin Rose; to O’Melveny & Myers’ Dunham and Vaughn, representing Warner; to Frank Marshall’s firm, Pollock, Bloom and Dekom; and to Howard Swainston of Breidenbach, Swainston, Yokaitis & Crispo, representing the special effects crew. The clearing house for every facet of Landis’ legal effort was the Century City office of Joel Behr. Behr dealt not only with the citations issued by the labor commissioner and Cal/OSHA, or the reports, albeit sketchy, he received concerning the affairs before the NTSB, but he also took control of much of Landis’ personal defense by protecting him on other fronts. Immediately after the crash, John Landis had his secretary Alpha Campbell collect for Behr all the Twilight Zone scripts and files, including production schedules and other documents, which were picked up and, according to Landis’ secretary, taken to Behr’s office. Behr’s vital activity was in mounting a criminal defense strategy with his specialist who monitored the DA’s office and sheriff ’s department, Harland Braun. To both lawyers, the NTSB hearings made unambiguously clear the central issue in the case, and after casting for a definition of the movie director’s responsibility on the set the phalanx decided on one that limited the director’s role, holding that he could not be held responsible for safety matters on the set and had to rely on professionals to ensure that safety was maintained. Nevertheless, John Landis’ aggressive and impetuous response to the NTSB questioning alerted Braun to the danger if ever Landis was put on a witness stand.

Behr and Braun were both aware that much work would have to be done with the cocky director. Braun remembers that what struck him was that whenever Landis spoke of his crew, he disparaged them. Braun was also dismayed to hear Landis minimize the expertise involved in many of the Twilight Zone stunts which he himself felt to be dangerous. To Braun, precisely this type of shoot-from-the-hip approach proved disquieting from a defense point of view; just as disturbing, he found, was a kind of blind spot in his client; ”an obliviousness to certain facts” in that John Landis as director refused to admit any responsibility. Landis, boasting that he could line up “fifty directors” in his defense, told Behr and Braun that he was sure the Director’s Guild would support his position. Behr eagerly fell in with this suggestion. As Braun recalled, Behr wanted to talk to Francis Ford Coppola. The idea, Behr enthused to Braun, was to have a parade of directors and film cognoscenti defend Landis’ actions. They would explain how movies were really made, Behr strategized, so the defense would not have it appear that Landis was purely trying to justify his own conduct on the set. Actually, without Behr’s prompting, the question was already being hotly argued internally among members of the normally staid and aloof Directors Guild of America. Hollywood’s prestigious and most influential “union” found itself stirred by the deaths of children on a Hollywood movie set. With little external fanfare, struggling for the first time with the question of defining the director’s responsibility for safety on the set, the DGA soon discovered that it had few guidelines on the subject and no more than a vague sort of safety committee. And so, with the safety issue long overdue, a very private meeting was convened within weeks of the crash. Limited to members of the DGA’s governing council, the secret meeting had about a dozen members in attendance, among them noted directors active in DGA politics like Arthur Hiller, Howard Koch, Among the issues aired in connection with the Twilight Zone disaster, the discussion inevitably turned to the possibility of drugs on the set. In response to one director who mentioned having heard rumors to the effect that drugs had been in evidence during the filming at Indian Dunes, Robert Aldridge, director of The Dirty Dozen, pointed out the virtual impossibility of controlling people on that score without some rather harsh methods.

After the meeting broke up there were a number of unexpected repercussions. Their echoes would still be heard two months later when, as a result of the TZ crash, a state legislative committee hearing was held on movie safety. However, according to one member at the DGA meeting, an unusually swift response came the very next morning in a telephone call from Joel Behr to director William Crane, the guild member who had voiced the rumor that Landis was “loaded” on the set the night of the accident. The caller, identifying himself as the lawyer for John Landis, asked Crane if he had accused John Landis at the DGA board meeting. He heard Behr warn him that his statements were “inflammatory” and “unfounded.” Against this background, while the studio faced mounting problems from the state legislature, Vic Morrow’s heirs, Carrie Morrow and Jennifer Jason Leigh, filed their own wrongful death lawsuits, citing among the defendants Warner Bros., Frank Marshall, and all of the four film directors; Landis, Spielberg, Dante and Miller. Morrow’s daughters alleged that some of those named were involved with drugs and alcohol at the time of the crash. The pressure on the studio seemed to be building, for shortly after the Morrow girls filed their lawsuits Don Llorente revealed that he had found three empty beer cans in the helicopter. Variety, in a headline story, called it an “ugly new wrinkle.” Meanwhile, deputy sheriff Tom Budds made a solitary inroad into Twilight territory. A conspiracy of silence governed this lishment made impassible by lawyers, Budds sought out the three men who worked with the fatal explosives that night. Ironically, because of their marginal status, they were initially ignored by the phalanx; temporarily left without the protection of legal counsel, these three powdermen were the only important participants from the set accessible to Budds. The NTSB record concerning this trio, Paul Stewart, Jerry Williams and Jimmy Camomile, was filled with inconsistencies. However, tracking down the powdermen whom investigators believed to be evasive, untruthful, “hiding” and coordinating among themselves, was not easy. Of the five SFX men on the set that night the SFX supervisor Paul Stewart remained a somewhat separate case. Budds narrowed the focus down to Jerry Williams and Jimmy Camomile because these two men alone had physically controlled the fatal fireball explosions in the village and river, 14 in all.

Budds narrowed the focus down to Jerry Williams and Jimmy Camomile because these two men alone had physically controlled the fatal fireball explosions in the village and river, 14 in all. One of them triggered the explosion responsible for the crash. In contrast to the shadowy figure of Jerry Williams (Budds first met him skulking on the set the morning of the crash) Jimmy Camomile made a favorable impression on the sheriff ’s deputy, who was disposed to accept his account that after the crash Paul Stewart and Jerry Williams had cleaned certain mortars and moved them. This was not the sort of diligence Budds would normally expect from people on a death scene, unless they had something to hide. Budds thought he smelled a rat. Other elements added to his suspicion. There were the SFX vehicles, the ten-ton truck and the pickup which had instantly fled the crash scene, checking in at The Burbank Studios at 4:15 a.m., less than two hours after the crash; and there was the discovery by Cal/OSHA investigators after they located the SFX truck a little later that morning that it had been swept clean of any evidence of alcohol or special effects explosives. And in trying to come up with an explanation of what it was the SFX crew was so anxious to conceal, Budds put everything together. He combined the suspicious behavior and personal friendships of the powdermen with Camomile’s candid statements of irregularities on the crash scene and from the sum of these parts developed what became known as the “switched mortar” theory. With this conclusion, Budds was able to provide an explanation for the suspect diligence shown by Stewart and Williams in fetching and carrying their powder pots and wires under the cover of darkness on the blasted and deserted set. But the theory, while it might have made a dramatic script, was fundamentally flawed and its ready acceptance by higher-ups was unfortunate because, after sending Budds on a wild goose chase and confusing the DA, it was ultimately proven wrong. The “switched mortar” scenario prevented investigators from ever determining the secret of the special-effects men, the only group of people with knowledge of who actually fired the fatal blasts on the set that night. What led Budds to his unfortunate conclusion stemmed from his appraisal of the film which showed that two particular shoreline huts sitting close together seemed to have been involved in downing the aircraft. In the center stage of the action, was the No. 4 drying hut (No. 4, because sound tests showed that the SFX mortar inside it was the fourth to be detonated in the sequence).

In the center stage of the action, was the No. 4 drying hut (No. 4, because sound tests showed that the SFX mortar inside it was the fourth to be detonated in the sequence). Screen right of No. 4 showed the hut by the pier with the Vietnamese sampan tied to it, the so-called No. 5 sampan hut (involving the fifth mortar, according to the sound tests, to be fired in the same sequence). Slowed down to a frame-by-frame analysis, the crash film showed that the fireballs from both huts, No. 4 and 5, fully enveloped the chopper’s tail section in a thick cloud of smoke and debris. From the early NTSB conclusions, it was already known that the onus for creating the key powerful explosion that ripped through a bamboo floor, hurling spears of rock-hard bamboo into the Huey’s highly vulnerable tail rotor, cracking it and thereby causing the helicopter to spin out of control, fell on the mortar under the No. 4 “drying hut.” With this in mind Budds concentrated all of his efforts on that particular hut. Accordingly, during the trial, the No. 4 came in for extraordinary attention as the structure whose debris caused the helicopter to come down. But by focusing on the “square” mortar under the drying hut Budds was misled to ignore the significance of the “round” mortar under No. 5, the sampan hut. Upon his arrival on the empty set at Indian Dunes, Budds had discovered a square mortar under the No. 4 drying hut along with one other mortar, a round one, standing free on the same muddy shoreline. At the time, Budds happened to know nothing about the role of these odd-looking contraptions and the strange location of the round mortar, set on the ground as if in readiness for a cook-out, had no particular significance for him. Unlike the square-shaped mortar underneath the No. 4 drying hut, the round-shaped pot, unanchored, “free-standing,” looked as if it had been moved. To all appearances it seemed to have been taken out from under or near the No. 5 sampan hut; Budds, however, mistakenly determined that it had been dragged from the No. 4 hut. That a switch had occurred. The assumption seemed plausible to him in the light of powderman Jimmy Camomile’s recollection expressed in his first statement that he had fired off the first four devices in the fatal scene; three in the back row and another, his fourth, a round mortar, under one of the shoreline huts in the front row.

The “switch” explained to Budds why, when he arrived on the set, the only mortar he found under a hut in the front row was a square mortar. A complete novice in the field of explosives, the lone deputy on the case readily surmised that someone had dragged Camomile’s round mortar from the drying hut and, to the end of obscuring the evidence, switched it with the square mortar which he had discovered in that same structure. Budds never considered, not even much later when sound tests refuted the “switch theory,” that anyone else but Camomile controlled the firing of the fourth explosive in the series that night. Budds remained fixated on the “switch” because it alone could explain to him the inconsistencies between what he had first found on his arrival on the set and what he had gleaned from his interviews with the consistently evasive powdermen. Indeed, Camomile’s account of the fourth device he fired on his board matched perfectly the mysterious round mortar fixed on by Budds and snapped by the sheriff ’s photographer on the morning after the crash. Camomile told Budds that from the photo it appeared that this very SFX device, which he was certain he had placed inside one of the shoreline huts, had been moved from its original location by one of the powdermen sometime after the fatal event. Camomile explained to the police that what made the position of the free-standing mortar in the sheriff ’s photo a mystery was that customarily a mortar is anchored by digging it into the earth so as to point it in the direction required by the shot, as well as for safety reasons. And in fact, when shown the sheriffs photo of the mysterious round mortar, he remarked to Budds, “that looks like the mortar in question,” referring to the explosive he said was his fourth, the one he had put inside one of the front row huts. Budds’ original transcript of his taped interview with Camomile shows that the sheriff became confused when Camomile spoke of the location of the fourth round mortar he set off in his series. The transcript shows that the homicide man erroneously concluded that Camomile was referring to the so-called No. 4 hut beneath which Budds had found the square mortar when in actuality Camomile was talking about a different hut altogether – the No. 5 sampan hut!

The transcript shows that the homicide man erroneously concluded that Camomile was referring to the so-called No. 4 hut beneath which Budds had found the square mortar when in actuality Camomile was talking about a different hut altogether – the No. 5 sampan hut! For Budds to advance the plausibility of his switch theory to his boss, deputy DA Gary Kesselman, was only a matter of pointing out the flagrant suspicions attaching to the special effects people. Furthermore, by discovering what he thought was a “motive” for the switch he completed the symmetry of the theory so as to make of it something weighty and whole in support of his findings: he found that round as opposed to square mortars tend to fire straight up, thereby producing a greater impact on a helicopter’s tail rotor. Budds was less successful in cracking other mysteries. He grappled in vain with questions such as how far he should believe Carl Pitman’s story, according to which booze had flowed on the set; or the size of explosives used in the final scene and why the special effects people continued to play down the strength of the explosives. However, by mistaking Camomile’s initial insistence in describing the so-called No. 4 as round, when Budds with his own eyes had seen it was square, the young detective felt satisfied that he had penetrated to the heart of the powdermen’s secrets. Though Budds’ “switch theory” was adopted by the DA’s office and later pursued by the grand jury to secure the indictment of Paul Stewart, it was soon invalidated by highly technical sound tests made on the film by the sheriff ’s department working closely with the FBI. The tests showed the order in which each of the mortars was fired and the approximate location of each at the time of the firing, enabling investigators to number each mortar in the sequence detonated during the final scene. Moreover, these highly sensitive tests were even able to determine the shape of the mortars, round or square. The result of the tests indicated that no switch was ever made and that when analyzed along with other related evidence they showed two things: 1) the square mortar was under the No. 4 drying hut and had been there all along, demolishing the idea that there had ever been a switch; but it also showed, 2) the square mortar under the drying hut was the fourth one to be fired in the series.

Thus, when six months after Budds had formed his distracting hypothesis the sound studies were finally released and compared against Camomile’s original statements they should have cleared up much of the confusion. They showed that in actuality a total of five mortars had been detonated during the fatal scene at the time Camomile had accounted for only four on his board; his fourth being the free-standing round mortar as he had originally described it to Budds. Thus, according to the sound tests, and by the process of elimination, the conclusion became inescapable that somebody else on the set had fired one of the first five mortars in the fatal scene. The only other SFX man with a firing board to control explosions in the village was Jerry Williams. The next question, never answered by the police, was which one of the first five mortars had been fired by Williams? Although DA investigators never understood their significance, the sheriff ’s sound tests were invaluable tools that should have helped clear up this mystery. The tests confirmed that in their early interviews with Budds, both Williams and Camomile had been talking about two different mortars at two different locations while the deputy mistakenly thought they were talking about the same location. The results of the sound tests underscored Camomile’s original account that the first three mortars he had set off were those in the back row. Camomile’s next mortar, according to his original account, was a round one inside a hut on the shoreline. But, according to the tests, the subsequent fireball, the fourth in the fatal series, came from a square mortar located inside the so-called No. 4 drying hut. The mortar that followed – the fifth – was round and perfectly matched Camomile’s original account of the firing of his fourth mortar. Thus, of the first five mortars fired in the fatal sequence, when compared to Camomile’s original account, the sound tests showed that Nos. 1, 2, 3 and 5 corresponded to the mortars controlled by his board. Therefore, in-between Camomile’s third and fourth shot in his series, the controversial square mortar erupted in the No. 4 drying hut. By the process of elimination investigators could have discovered that this fourth detonation in the series, a square mortar, must have been fired from Williams’ board, just as John Landis and", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634243667_cleaned.txt:180:2856af2d7c98", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 1784, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634243667_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634243667", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634243667_cleaned", "chunk_index": 181, "text": "the fatal sequence, when compared to Camomile’s original account, the sound tests showed that Nos. 1, 2, 3 and 5 corresponded to the mortars controlled by his board.

By the process of elimination investigators could have discovered that this fourth detonation in the series, a square mortar, must have been fired from Williams’ board, just as John Landis and set designer Richard Sawyer both had privately concluded in the immediate aftermath of the crash. Robert Frasco, Landis’ private investigator, after having read transcripts of confidential interviews with John Landis and consultations with the director’s legal phalanx, also identified Williams as “the man who pushed the button.” In the end Jerry Williams always denied that he fired the No. 4 mortar. In other areas Williams’ version of events directly countered the physical evidence, notably in his insistence to Budds that the floor in hut No. 4, which he said was the first thing he ran to after the crash, was still intact at that time. Budds, of course, had seen the sheriff ’s photos, as well as the footage from the cliffside Camera D, both showing that well before Williams had arrived at the No. 4 hut, literally within seconds of the detonation, its floor was utterly gone. However, the investigators never discovered the truth about who fired the key explosives in the scene. Accordingly, the “switched mortar” theory would eventually rank as one of the bigger blunders committed by the sheriff ’s department and the DA’s office in their Twilight Zone investigation. The investigation’s early obsession with the “switch theory” had another unfortunate result besides distracting Budds from ever being able to reconstruct what happened at Indian Dunes. It took the heat off other areas where the special effects crew might have been scheming and malfeasant. For example, Budds failed to discover by checking sales receipts and fire department records that the 6-oz. size explosive charges, constantly referred to by the special effects men during questioning in order to minimize the size of the blasts, were non-existent! The actual sales records, overlooked for over five years by the police and DA’s investigators, showed that the smallest-sized explosive charges purchased for the fatal scene were 8-oz. charges. Also overlooked was special permit No. 55926 issued by the fire department to Paul Stewart ten days before the crash. It gave him permission to purchase 200 feet of 100 grain prima cord. This amount of “high” explosive was capable of knocking down as many as 70 telephone poles, “like matchsticks,” according to special effects experts. Both of these pieces of evidence ran contrary to all SFX accounts that the highest-powered explosives on the set of the TZ crash were 6-oz. “low” explosives. A “high” explosive far more lethal than the black powder", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634243667_cleaned.txt:181:c057f9fc239d", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 1785, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634243667_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634243667", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634243667_cleaned", "chunk_index": 182, "text": "Paul Stewart ten days before the crash.

A “high” explosive far more lethal than the black powder bombs admittedly on the set that night, the prima cord was never mentioned by SFX crew members. Paul Stewart’s men, resisting every investigative onslaught, hung to-gether. Members of an esoteric trade, the lowest caste on the set,the powdermen formed a tight-knit crew, almost like blood brothers. Even though the sound tests appeared to disprove it, they stuck to Jerry Williams’ original story. For to admit that the No. 4 was fired by Williams not only would mean admitting to negligent planning, it would open up the question of how that explosive was cued. Williams had already told the NTSB that his cue to set off his first fireball explosion in the village was when Vic and the kids reached the “stick,” the nearly six-foot-long “eukie pole” planted just minutes before the crash by Paul Stewart himself in a carefully pre-arranged spot in the middle of the river. Stewart had used the stick to coordinate several camera angles for the special effects explosions and the actors. However, at the very same time that Williams was cueing off the stick for his first detonation, according to the director’s shot plan, the helicopter with its powerful Nite-Sun spotlight was to pursue Vic as he crossed the river out of the exploding village toward the stick. That meant that Williams’ cue to detonate the No. 4, based on Vic’s reaching the stick, was timed to go off at precisely the moment the chopper hovered over the village shoreline in the only position that would allow the aircraft to keep the spotlight fixed on the actor. This cueing positioned the chopper’s tail rotor directly above the No. 4 drying hut. It was the failure of the investigators to understand the relationship between the timing of the helicopter’s spotlight role and the cueing of the fatal explosives that prevented them from uncovering the risky plan that caused the deadly crash. It proved to be their biggest blunder. Had it been established that Williams had set off the No. 4 fireball at the time Vic was approaching the “stick,” as the special effects technician had presumably been instructed, investigators could have pinpointed precisely where the movie director had all along planned the chopper to be at the moment the special effects explosives were cued to go off, especially the fatal fireball from inside the No. 4 hut.

Furthermore, while Budds never understood what occurred in the final seconds, the angle required of the powerful beam from the chopper’s spotlight, so as to keep its focus on the actors, explained why it was necessary for Landis to order the helicopter to move closer to the deadly shoreline explosion during the last seconds of the flight. To keep the spotlight on Vic and the kids as they made their way across the river, the director’s final order, “lower, lower, closer, closer,” as heard by Randy Robinson aboard the helicopter, was given to the pilot. This scenario, in which the cue for the No. 4 explosion was the “stick,” thoroughly demolished any claim that the aircraft was ever planned to be out of there before the SFX men set off the village. It also reaffirmed the pilot’s private confession to the cub reporter from the Herald, “They wanted the blades… the whole bit in there.” Williams’ claim that he didn’t fire the square No. 4 “drying hut” mortar had the direct consequence of focusing the inquiry on Camomile as the powderman responsible for the fatal explosion. And it turned out surprisingly easy to deflect the issue of responsibility from Williams and ultimately from Paul Stewart, by getting Camomile to profess that he had simply made a mistake. The former Navy man, emotionally affected by the event and unable to remember many details, readily accepted the versions Stewart and Jerry Williams held out to him; by his own admission, he discussed these matters with his two friends and co-workers on several occasions. In fact, confidential interviews between Camomile and some of his own attorneys clearly showed that the most controversial and critical recollections, those in which he took responsibility for loading and firing the No. 4 mortar, came to him strictly as the result of conferences between himself, Paul Stewart, Paul Stewart’s lawyer, Arnold Klein, and Jerry Williams. The substance of Camomile’s private declarations never surfaced in the investigation; but contrary to what he told investigators, Camomile himself privately admitted to Paul Stewart’s attorneys he “had no real recollection” of controlling the No. 4 mortar, and that “one of the other gentlemen could’ve also loaded it…” By the time of the grand jury hearings, it appeared that Camomile had been persuaded by Paul Stewart and Jerry Williams to change his story in several key areas.

For the first time, for example, contrary to his original statements to the NTSB a year earlier, and this time accompanied by an insurance company lawyer, he told investigators that the “stick” in the middle of the river was designed to help insure safety in the fatal scene. Earlier he had professed to have no idea of the purpose of the stick. Jerry Camomile’s newly changed story was accompanied with the SFX crew’s apocryphal recollection that only 6-oz. charges were used in or near the shoreline huts. By not checking the receipts and permits, the investigators failed to learn that no 6-oz. charges were ever purchased for the set that night. It was another small oversight but there were many and they added up. And joined to major blunders like the “switched mortar” theory, they went a long way in explaining the investigation’s confusion and singular lack of success in accurately reconstructing the events that transpired that night. Less than a year after the crash, James Camomile privately told Paul Stewart’s lawyer that the disaster at Indian Dunes had left him “numb.” Whether stricken by grief or leaned upon by desperate friends, by the time the grand jury convened in the summer of 1983 he appeared convinced – even though the physical evidence tended to invalidate his story – that the No. 4 explosion had been on his board. Camomile’s acknowledgement that he fired the fatal shot as a result of having made a mistake had the effect of closing down the investigation of Jerry Williams and the other powdermen. This result removed the focus from Williams, the only technician in the immediate proximity to the director, at his side, in the best position to receive a cue to detonate his deadly explosion. Another significant result was that it closed the door on the question of the poor planning and the drinking by the powdermen that night. The consumption of beer and vodka by some of them had been observed by a number of witnesses, including the helicopter pilot’s recollection of smelling “beer breath” near the powder wagon. At the exact moment of the fatal No. 4 hut explosion, the director was observed motioning the helicopter over the square mortar that the NTSB identified as the deadly culprit. The powdermen had good reason to seek the elimination of the issue of Williams’ connection with blowing the No. 4 mortar.

The powdermen had good reason to seek the elimination of the issue of Williams’ connection with blowing the No. 4 mortar. But perhaps the most compelling motive came from Landis’ own private investigation. The propman, Landis’ longtime associate Mike Milgrom, gave the director’s own investigators a shocking tale of a non-stop drinking party around the SFX truck where Stewart, in Milgrom’s words, appeared too intoxicated to handle the firing board in the final scene, therefore assigning Williams to the job. Milgrom’s account presented Landis with a strong card to hold out against the powder chief in any legal proceedings. But in terms of what it might do to implicate himself the card’s value was hardly assured, for his own investigation had discovered the disconcerting view held by some crew members that Landis had to have known about the alcohol consumption on the set that night. One particular crew member who knew that Paul Stewart had a history of drinking actually believed that the director had willingly closed his eyes to the drinking by the powder chief in order to make him more compliant. Furthermore, playing this card against Stewart opened the possibility of rousing certain other crew members who had noted among those employed in the TZ filming a number of coke-sniffers from the Blues Brothers set. Judiciously, Landis kept his hand. He did not put the card in circulation and Paul Stewart, in turn, did what he could to protect the director. He kept the deputy sheriff in the dark about Landis’ drive to create a “wall of fire” in the big scene. Budds’ task in extracting the truth from the pariahs of the set was complicated by the fact that the powdermen contradicted not only each other but also John Landis. Paul Stewart, in a glaring discrepancy with a statement which Landis had made to the NTSB the day before, told Budds that he was never consulted about the location of the helicopter relative to the special-effects charges. In contrast to Landis, who said he had no knowledge that a mortar had been placed inside any hut, Stewart told Budds how he had pointed out to the director where all the explosives were as they walked the set just before the final scene. Throughout this interrogation by Budds, Stewart insisted on having told the director that he did not want to place bombs under the back row of huts. “He wanted to put mortars inside the huts,” Stewart mentioned, referring to the back row, “I said if I put them inside the huts then you might blow something away.” In the same police interview, Stewart eventually", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634243667_cleaned.txt:185:5fc7b467af72", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 1789, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634243667_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634243667", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634243667_cleaned", "chunk_index": 186, "text": "the director where all the explosives were as they walked the set just before the final scene.

He stated that he’d become confused by the questioning because he always had personally referred to this structure as a “lean-to,” not a hut! It was not until December 1, 1982, some four months after the crash, that a story appearing in LA’s Herald-Examiner for the first time made public some of the same discrepancies found by the sheriff ’s homicide man. It was written by Andy Furillo and behind his astonishing report appeared to be the hand of Don Llorente. It could not have been coincidence that Furillo’s article appeared at the same time that Llorente’s superiors in Washington cut short his NTSB investigation by refusing him permission to reactivate certain suspect witnesses. The “carrot-top cub” had read all of the 677 sensational pages of the NTSB Investigation into the “Twilight Zone Accident,” and the immediate result of Furillo’s article was to set the stalled investigation back in motion. His article contained the kind of damaging information which Landis’ phalanx had sought to keep out of the press by making the initial deal with the NTSB, trading Landis’ “testimony” for official silence. Furillo’s article noted among the NTSB findings reports that Spielberg had been on the set, that debris from the No. 4 hut brought the helicopter down, and that while Landis denied it, witnesses said that they had watched him order the helicopter directly into the explosions. For the first time people learned that the TZ filming had been replete with dangerous activities in the days leading up to the fatal crash, including live ammo in a scene involving Vic Morrow, that alcohol and marijuana were used on the set hours before the tragedy, and that some people were “flying high” on cocaine, according to quoted sources. The story revealed that investigators still grappled with uncertainties concerning the deadly mortars. They didn’t know how the mortars were placed in the huts or whether a smaller mortar was replaced by a larger one. They even questioned whether someone surreptitiously placed an added charge in the fireball-belching pots.

From Furillo the public first learned of the absolute chaos on the set both before and after the crash. He mentioned Landis’ controversial NTSB interview which had never before appeared in the press. “His answers,” the cub wrote in a scoop, “were hesitant and stuttering.” Furillo pointed out how Landis in the interview had claimed the explosions were different from the ones earlier that evening, and the cub brought up the bullhorn, mentioning that at least six witnesses on the ground at the time of the crash had either heard Landis shouting over the bullhorn to the helicopter or saw him motioning the chopper downward with his bullhorn in hand. On a related but different front John Landis was experiencing a worsening relationship with Dorcey Wingo. In the very beginning the pilot had tried to contact Dan Allingham in the spirit of cooperation. But incredibly, Wingo never heard from any of the Landis group until almost a year after their indictments when they were being arraigned together. Dorcey felt snubbed; by failing in civility, Landis hurt Dorcey’s feelings. Wingo now joined in the finger-pointing fray. Within a week following the accident he appeared for his second lengthy interview with the NTSB, this time with his own insurance lawyer to present a slightly new version of the facts as he saw them that night. In succeeding months, it became very clear to Wingo that he was being singled out as Landis’ prime finger pointing target. His attorneys, joining the heirs of the Chens, Les and Morrows, promptly filed suit. Wingo’s lawsuit alleged that Landis and Warner had knowingly run a reckless set and exposed the pilot to excess hazard. It further alleged that as a result of the crash, he had personally suffered from the nightmarish scene and was permanently scarred by it. The differences between Wingo and Landis would not be resolved until the very end of the Twilight Zone trial. Their combative relationship of finger-pointing, secret moves and outright threats would continue right up until the moment Wingo took the stand – and, in a dramatic reversal, absolved John Landis, giving the director a favorable account!! he showdown that forced Warner to reluctantly cast its lot with John Landis took place during the first week of September less than two months after the crash.

Its setting was again the Century City office of the entertainment law firm of which Joel Behr was the junior partner. It was a confrontation of high-priced lawyers over a high-stakes game. The lawyers for each side had gotten to know each other during innumerable powwows by telephone and face-to-face meetings over the preceding month. The polite exchanges between the two groups failed to mask differences which continually flared into acrimony. At the showdown in Behr’s office the phalanx: Behr, Diemer, Braun, Peterson, and Behr’s law partner, Ronald Rosen, faced the Warner wall of Stan Belkin, Bill Vaughn and Scott Dunham, in addition to the formidable legal gun hired by O’Melveny & Myers, Doug Dalton, one of LA’s top criminal lawyers who had represented expatriate director Roman Polanski on rape charges; in another well-known case, that of Norvelle Young, the president of LA’s prestigious Pepperdine College who killed two people in a drunk driving accident, Dalton gained great local publicity for managing to get probation for the college president. A situation existed, according to Harland Braun, where Behr grew to distrust Warner’s motives. And it was in a tense atmosphere that Behr laid his strongest cards on the table. During this highly-charged meeting between allies he turned to the formidable Doug Dalton. Landis’ lawyer explained that he had called the meeting to relay information gained from his clients, Landis, Folsey and Allingham, that would implicate Warner. Behr specifically mentioned “Spielberg and Warner Bros. people.” With his low-lidded poker gaze and the amazing crest of glossy hair, Behr electrified those present by plunking down trump after trump. They heard again how it came about that the character Bill was “softened.” Behr mentioned the script changes Landis made at the direction of Warner higher-ups, adding the exploding village scene with Morrow and the two kids, and receiving an extra $200, 000 from the studio to cover the cost of building the village and filming the new scene. Behr mentioned the kids and how they were paid and the role of Frank Marshall. The point he tried to make was that Warner must have known about these matters. It was convincingly done by bringing up Spielberg’s man, Frank Marshall, and demonstrating how deeply enmeshed he was in the illegal child-hiring plan. The studio lawyers heard Behr claim that Marshall actually had a “blind” telephone call made to the labor commissioner, reporting afterwards to the Landis group to forget about getting waivers from that office to film the children in the night scene.

Behr informed Belkin and the O’Melveny lawyers that Marshall together with Warner watchdog Henderling signed the check and that Marshall knew that the purpose of this check was to pay the children “under the table.” Underscoring Marshall’s involvement in the hiring scheme, Behr revealed that Marshall had even been irritated that Bonnie Radford, who drafted the check, was made privy to the secret of the kids. And slamming down his ace in the hole he implicated Warner’s top-ranking executive in the film. Exposure of Lucy Fisher’s role in writing the children into the Landis segment meant that knowledge of the plan may have reached the studio’s highest echelons, perhaps even the pinnacle of the Spielberg organization. It was the last thing the movie company would have wanted. Lucy Fisher had developed a special “chemistry” with Steven Spielberg, one of the most precious assets to grow out of the TZ movie. The studio hoped that the two elements combined would result in a profitable formula (a few years later, in fact, Lucy Fisher was credited with turning Steven Spielberg on to filming The Color Purple which won 11 Academy Award nominations in 1986 and was Warner’s most successful film that year, generating over $150 million). The studio lawyers facing the phalanx in Century City heard Behr describe how, upon being told by Landis that the children would be used at night and paid in cash, Fisher had merely responded by saying that she didn’t want to know about it and if confronted would say that she had never heard of the matter. Countering, the studio lawyers zeroed in on matters concerning Behr’s own client. Not knowing how much the Warner lawyers already knew, Behr minimized Landis’ personal role in the illegal hiring. He admitted that his clients did refer to the children on the set as the “Vietnamese,” explaining that the director did not want to alert anyone to their presence. Behr didn’t know whether Warner had already learned of the cover-up plot on the set aimed at concealing the kids from the studio welfare teacher Jack Tice. He did not volunteer the information. Myca and Renee were kept out of sight, Behr claimed with a straight face, because they were sleeping in the trailer. While this high-stakes poker game took place, the studio’s own internal investigation had already demonstrated that at least in some areas Landis’ attorney was not bluffing.

Ordinarily, the fact that a key executive like Lucy Fisher knew about the illegally hired children was disturbing enough. But it was knottier than that. To the studio executives one name was synonymous with Spielberg and implications far more disturbing existed in the person of Frank Marshall, the highest-ranking production official on the set that night. Marshall alone could determine whether knowledge of the illegal hiring had spread to Steven Spielberg. As the meeting ended a tacit understanding of the need for a united front became apparent to all those present. As it did over Folsey’s, the Twilight Zone tragedy cast a shadow over the life of Frank Marshall. Young, handsome, tall and lithe, with varsity good looks, boyishly self-absorbed and amiable, Frank Marshall reflected the laid-back style of affluent Newport Beach where he grew up. Marshall had Hollywood connections through his father, Jack Marshall, a civil engineer-turned-musician and composer who provided musical scores for television movies and at one time arranged record albums for vocalists like Judy Garland, Peggy Lee and Vic Damone. At the Marshall home showbiz was always in the air and it entered into the blood of the son who built up a repertoire of magic tricks. At a later stage this repertoire would unfold and transform into “Dr. Fantasy,” the magician, showing a Frank Marshall who loved to entertain an audience; Dr. Fantasy became a Spielberg movie wrap-party tradition. Marshall’s career at UCLA reflected an ambivalence. It began with courses in engineering, then a sudden switch to music and drama arts, and finally a lame political science degree and a vague desire to enter law. Like his father, Marshall wanted to have something “to fall back on,” and when he fell into film making it was on the business end. Frank Marshall’s formal introduction to the film business came about as a result of meeting Peter Bogdanovich in 1967 at a party, and while still a senior in college he accepted Bogdanovich’s invitation to work on his first film, Targets. He stayed on as a member of the Bogdanovich production crew that did The Last Picture Show and What’s Up, Doc?, and became associate producer on Paper Moon, Daisy Miller, At Long Last Love and Nickelodeon. He had other production credits on Orson Welles’ The Other As a trademark, Marshall began making brief cameo appearances in the films he worked on for director Peter Bogdanovich.

His best-known spots, however, were in Spielberg productions: he’s the pilot that helps Harrison Ford escape in beginning of movie Raiders and the neighbor watering the lawn in Poltergeist. Marshall even became a kind of “cameo director,” developing a passion for the “Making of…” series, the behind-the-scenes shooting of films like Raiders of the Lost Ark or, Twilight Zone: The Movie. Steven Spielberg and Marshall first met in Rome when Marshall was still associated with Bogdanovich. According to Marshall’s studio bio, Spielberg was “impressed with Marshall’s energy.” But it may be supposed that, seeing in the easy self-assurance of Marshall, the perennial preppy, something of the Big-Man-On-Campus, Spielberg was won over by the personality. When the time came to assemble the team for Raiders of the Lost Ark, Spielberg and George Lucas chose Marshall to produce the massive project. Raiders placed first in worldwide box office in 1981, won five Oscars, and catapulted Marshall’s career. The following year Marshall produced Poltergeist, he was production supervisor on E.T., and at 35 shared a Hollywood phenomenon that comes around infrequently like a comet with a blazing tail of money. With three movies, Raiders, E.T. and Poltergeist eclipsing all box-office records in motion picture history, Spielberg was the top director of all time and Frank Marshall the top producer. Marshall’s success was in great part the success of the team approach that typified management on the highest-grossing films in history. Like Landis and Folsey, Spielberg and Marshall shared a partnership combining the creative and business side. From a managerial point of view this approach suited the nature of the product, that is, a film, in the new murderously competitive Hollywood where films got yanked straightaway if they were not immediate geysers of profit. With budget considerations paramount, a strong producer often makes the difference as to whether or not a film is profitable by avoiding costly production problems and keeping the filming from going over-budget. The producer who applies the business mind to film making may not be a well-known figure to the public but he is a key person in the Hollywood industry. Coincidentally, Raiders also meant the big break for Kathleen Kennedy, who was to become Frank Marshall’s romantic interest. A pretty brunette in her mid-thirties, she had originally wanted to be a ski instructor but took up nursing, also to the common-sensical end that she might have something “to fall back on.” In 1972, however, she landed a job with San Diego’s NBC-affiliated KSGO, doing primarily camera work and jobs around the newsroom.

She graduated from San Diego State University in 1975 in the same year that 26-year-old Steven Spielberg made his first hit movie, Jaws. An introduction to Steven Spielberg got her “bits and pieces” of work in 1941, the movie which Spielberg was then directing. The dubious significance of Kathleen Kennedy’s first job in a Hollywood production was that it turned out to be Spielberg’s only lemon. But though it bombed at the box office, 1941 had for Kennedy a practical significance. It introduced her to the often-troublesome realities of making a film. She worked on the set where behind the scenes America’s biggest comedy star, John Belushi, was so drugged up that he literally rolled out of the car that delivered him to the set. Tolerating Belushi’s habits and watching Spielberg struggle to get the zombified actor to do his scenes taught Kathleen Kennedy the lengths the movie’s top people had to go to get it done. It was during the filming of Raiders that Spielberg, impressed by her absolute dedication, broached the astounding news that she was going to be the producer of his next movie. That movie was E.T., on which Kathleen Kennedy was credited as co-producer with Steven Spielberg. Overnight the erstwhile nursing student joined Marshall at the pinnacle of the Spielberg organization. When Frank Marshall and Kathleen Kennedy began living together there were no headlines. They were not fanzine material. With Spielberg they brought suburbia to Hollywood with no lavishness, dissipation and scandal; jogging, keeping regular hours, Frank and Kathy were workaholics whose total identification with Spielberg grew into a legendary friendship. The trio worked intimately on the world’s biggest box-office hits. On E.T., Marshall was production supervisor; on Poltergeist, Frank Marshall was Steven’s co-producer and Kathleen was production supervisor. “Steven, Frank and I,” Kathleen told a reporter, “like to think of ourselves as one little family. We do everything together.” In Kathleen Kennedy’s case the identification even extended to the $1.5 million piece of equipment that played E.T., whose eyes she proudly described as “my blue.” The TZ movie was Marshall’s fourth Spielberg film. The pace on it was hectic. While occupied with the Landis portion he was also working on the other three segments. His hours ran the full day and much of the night. He was busy making the Making of… documentary on the Twilight Zone filming.

He was busy making the Making of… documentary on the Twilight Zone filming. At the same time, he was working on Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom, in addition to a made-for-TV movie for NBC and Universal entitled, A Pennant for the Kremlin. Marshall had in development for MGM a movie called The Protector through his newly formed Frank Marshall Productions which had just completed its first project, a 15-minute documentary its founder produced and directed about the making of Poltergeist. Everything Marshall touched in that strange Summer of Spielberg turned to gold. The Making of Poltergeist turned out to be a huge success on Pay TV. As the TZ movie’s executive producer Marshall’s job had begun before pre-production took place. He made the business arrangements and worked out the complex organizational structure on the four-part film in meetings with Warner’s production executive Fred Gallo and with Lucy Fisher. Selected personally by Spielberg to oversee the complete filming operation, he was, specifically, to act as mediator between Landis’ Fly By Night operation and Warner. From the very start the differences between Warner, specifically between Fred Gallo and the Landis group on almost every important issue, required all of Marshall’s arbitration skills. In one such instance Gallo objected to giving the young director his own crew, suggesting that one crew be used for all four segments in order to save money and avoid hiring problems, as well complications with film credits. Because Landis insisted on independence in producing his segment, Marshall intervened and arranged it so that Landis would have complete authority with the understanding that he would conform to the rules. Officially Landis’ TZ segment was part of a big studio production directly controlled by Warner. However, by operating like an independent producer, or “indie,” the Landis organization was able to exploit cost-saving non-union labor. Even the use of the name Fly By Night in seeking bids from various suppliers disguised the fact that it was a Warner production, so as to give Landis an edge in securing services from outfits known for giving better deals to cash-strapped “indies” as opposed to the baronial majors. This especially applied to the use of low-paid production assistants as drivers in place of the drivers from Hollywood’s powerful Teamster Local 395, with whom Warner had a labor agreement. At meetings between the studio and George Folsey Jr. this thorny labor question resulted in tense confrontations. On at least two occasions the studio blocked the cost-cutting measures proposed by Fly By Night, insisting that", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634243667_cleaned.txt:193:0e1696314ac2", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 1797, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634243667_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634243667", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634243667_cleaned", "chunk_index": 194, "text": "outfits known for giving better deals to cash-strapped “indies” as opposed to the baronial majors.

At meetings between the studio and George Folsey Jr. this thorny labor question resulted in tense confrontations. On at least two occasions the studio blocked the cost-cutting measures proposed by Fly By Night, insisting that Landis comply with all Warner Bros.’ union agreements. Frank Marshall, the picture’s executive producer, mediated between the studio and Fly By Night right up until the pre-production shooting with Dan Aykroyd and Albert Brooks. The disputed issues always involved saving money. Early on in the film Marshall discovered Allingham doubling up as 1st AD and UPM. By having Allingham double up without obtaining a waiver from the Directors Guild, Fly By Night was potentially in violation of labor agreements between Warner and the DGA. Marshall advised Allingham that it was a bad idea and after completing pre-production work Elie Cohn was brought on board as 1st AD. Marshall found himself constantly caught in internal disputes of this sort on and off the set. Eventually, relations between the two sides hit a low point. The Landis people, according to one source directly involved in the arguments, hated Warner’s Gallo. But the actual source of their resentment was not the exasperating production veteran. It was the rules he represented. He stood for contracts and obligations. He represented soberness as opposed to anarchy. His exasperating quality stemmed from wanting to play it safe rather than fast and loose. In one instance, after learning that Landis planned to shoot Dan Aykroyd and Albert Brooks in the film’s prologue without having obtained insurance for them, Gallo quickly intervened to demand that Landis provide the necessary coverage. Marshall himself at times helplessly watched as snafus piled up due to the economy practiced by the Landis group. An avid Aykroyd fan, he was present at the shooting of the prologue scene on the disastrous first day of filming. When the low-quality camera equipment broke down, Marshall not only didn’t get to see the expected entertainment but the production was delayed for a day with the director forced to make a rapid and expensive shift to more reliable Panavision cameras – the same equipment Fred Gallo had suggested Landis use in the first place! Even to Marshall the Landis organization appeared to want to cut corners more often than was acceptable in his dealings with Warner. An internal memo actually showed that he was not above pointing the finger at the Landis people, calling them “shoddy” and “unprofessional.” Yet he could not be entirely unbiased for the reason that his own interest favored saving money.

An internal memo actually showed that he was not above pointing the finger at the Landis people, calling them “shoddy” and “unprofessional.” Yet he could not be entirely unbiased for the reason that his own interest favored saving money. Since he had a piece of the deal, he benefited each time the director doubled or tripled up some position, or shaved off some other money item. The whole deal was structured as an incentive to all those with points in the production to maximize their earnings by keeping the expenses down. That way the studio got its low-budget movie with a big-budget name. The ambiguity of Marshall’s position was nowhere more apparent than in the child-hiring episode. No one had more experience than Frank Marshall concerning the rules that pertained to working with children on the set. That summer Spielberg’s E.T. and Poltergeist were films all about kids in which children were used prominently. There could be no doubt at the time the Landis segment got underway that Marshall knew about problems involved in using the kids in night shoots. A confidential Warner memo actually describes a meeting held on one occasion in Landis’ Universal bungalow at which Marshall admitted that he specifically addressed Landis’ desire to use 4- or 5-year olds in the dangerous Twilight Zone scenes. Marshall had followed the evolution of the script. He had personally discussed with Lucy Fisher the script revision where the kids are rescued from the attacking helicopter to make Bill more sympathetic in the movie. From his reading of the exploding village scene Marshall, according to the memo, knew that there would be a problem with using the kids at night. Spielberg’s deputy was on the set for the scene in which Bill realizes his transformation on film. Just before the start of the 2:20 scene the kids were being readied to be thrust into the hands of Vic Morrow prior to his perilous dash across the river. Frank Marshall at that time was standing on the river’s edge, across from the village where the main action was to take place, with location manager Dick Vane. At the same time, Jack Tice, the target of the concealment plot, remembered that as he set out to move upstream, spotting fireballs, he made his final communication with Landis; at which point, Tice recalls, Dick Vane, standing next to Marshall, shouted at him. For the third time that night, Vane asked Tice where he would be for the final scene. Tice did not catch on that he was being “positioned” until after the crash when he discovered the cover-up of the children. During the catastrophic final shot Marshall was so frightened he dove under a truck and", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634243667_cleaned.txt:195:01a4f4adfb25", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 1799, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634243667_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634243667", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634243667_cleaned", "chunk_index": 196, "text": "to move upstream, spotting fireballs, he made his final communication with Landis; at which point, Tice recalls, Dick Vane, standing next to Marshall, shouted at him.

During the catastrophic final shot Marshall was so frightened he dove under a truck and witnessed the fireballs, the helicopter, the disaster and panic. Spielberg’s man seemed to be the only cool head in the chaos that followed. Marshall was one of the first to enter the river, and, though this act was kept a secret throughout the entire five years of the TZ case, he carried the lifeless body of Renee Chen to shore and laid it at the feet of Virginia Kearns, the movie’s hairdresser, who held a flashlight while vain attempts were being made to revive the dead girl. Then Marshall ran back to assist John Landis who was observed by Kearns “just running around, saying, “Oh, shit. Oh, Jesus!” When Marshall reached Landis, according to other witnesses, the director was in a state of shock, flailing and screaming and beating his hands on the blood-stained water. Marshall helped Landis to the shore and put him next to the small Asian man with the dazed look who was the father of Myca. The script girl Kathryn Wooten remembered Frank Marshall through the haze and confusion calling “a wrap” and shooing people away. One technician who watched the pandemonium was under the impression that Marshall was trying to get rid of everyone before the police came. He watched Marshall walk up a trail leading away from the scene; other movie execs followed. The special effects people, too, melted into the night, while a lot of the technicians and drivers stuck around to see what help they could give. When Frank Marshall walked up the trail leading away from the scene he walked for all intents and purposes out of the Twilight Zone case. Spielberg’s man never had to address the many issues raised by the crash. From the very beginning the probers that swarmed over the stricken dunes overlooked him and afterwards any investigator seeking further information faced the barrier of Pollock, Bloom and Dekom, another high-powered entertainment law firm. Lawyer Tom Pollock, soon to be chosen to head Universal Studios, ran the legal strategy with a small unit consisting chiefly of his assistant Rick Rosen. In spite of its small size the unit was far more effective than the director’s own phalanx in keeping their client out of the various investigations.

Tom Pollock was a Kennedy-Democrat liberal and part of the new Hollywood establishment. With a handsome Jerry Mahoney mustache, he was one of the rising breed of young ambitious attorneys who moved between Hollywood’s influential entertainment law firms and the majors. His law career converged with the youth market phenomenon that consumed Hollywood in the early 70s. Pollock was one of the bright young men in the legal profession who helped form the bridge between the traditional studio system approach and the new Hollywood of bearded young auteurs. At the time Pollock became active as an entertainment lawyer in the motion picture business he was closely identified with Thom Mount. An intellectual-looking former 60s radical, Mount came to symbolize the breed dubbed “baby moguls.” Mount rose with breakneck speed through the Universal Studios ranks after having blazed the trail in the teen-action market with Smokey and the Bandit. At Universal, Mount was considered a “boy wonder.” And with Mount in mind Hollywood rushed to open its doors to the bright, articulate and exceedingly ambitious young men and women from the universities and law firms. Mount began as reader for Universal’s production chief Ned Tanen. Following Smokey’s giant box-office success, he rose to head the studio’s creative trust, consisting of himself, Tanen and the godfather, Landis’ best friend Sean Daniel. Mount was a booster of John Landis, who after Animal House was also hailed as a boy wonder. The world of boy wonders and baby moguls was intense and clannish like a small suburb. In the early 70s Mount and Pollock had been involved in the attempt made by Universal to cultivate a relationship with George Lucas, whose Star Wars held the number one box-office place until dislodged by Spielberg’s E.T. By the time Pollock became president of Universal, “Steven” had his base in the Universal lot’s Amblin complex with “Frank” and “Kathy.” Tom Pollock was one of the most upwardly mobile young lawyers to be found in young Hollywood. But in defending Marshall, Pollock was also lucky. In the finger-pointing that went on between the studio and Landis, pitting O’Melveny against Behr, the finger pointed past the film’s executive producer. And the Hollywood lawyers, Pollock and Rosen, had their work cut out by assuring that the finger stayed pointed that way. The Pollock-Rosen legal unit concentrated its chief effort on a tiny state bureau that dealt with industrial safety matters. Initially, it was the only one of all the investigative agencies to focus on the Marshall/Spielberg connection with the disaster in Indian Dunes.

The Pollock-Rosen legal unit concentrated its chief effort on a tiny state bureau that dealt with industrial safety matters. Initially, it was the only one of all the investigative agencies to focus on the Marshall/Spielberg connection with the disaster in Indian Dunes. The California Occupational Safety and Health Administration, Cal/OSHA, at a very early stage cited Marshall by name, along with George Folsey Jr. and John Landis in an entity called “Twilight Zone Productions.” Among other things this small agency was charged with making the key recommendation to the DA’s office as to the actual employer and whether or not to prosecute for criminal violations of work-place safety laws. In the early days there were frequent meetings and telephone calls between Cal/OSHA and the DA’s lawyer in charge of the case, namely, Deputy DA Gary Kesselman. In a September 10, 1982, Cal/OSHA memo, the deputy chief for safety indicated that there were still many unresolved problems with the case and that Cal/OSHA was still “not sure” about the role of Twilight Zone Productions and Frank Marshall as employers in the film. Thus, it was not coincidental that after several meetings between Cal/OSHA and the district attorney, Cal/OSHA’s lead investigator, lawyer Marilyn Levin from the Enforcement Division, received a telephone call from lawyer Rick Rosen who introduced himself as representing Twilight Zone Productions and Frank Marshall. Rosen asked to meet with Levin with regard to his client’s involvement in the crash. She agreed. A serious-minded young woman from Chicago, Marilyn Levin, as part of Llorente’s team, had earlier questioned John Landis. In her meeting with Frank Marshall’s attorneys, Levin heard Pollock and Rosen explain their view of how the film business worked and how it related to Frank Marshall. The movie attorneys joked with the young bureaucrat while discoursing on the arcane customs of Hollywood film making. Levin was given to understand that just because Marshall had the credit for being the film’s executive producer it didn’t mean that he was top dog; she learned from Pollock that the credit you get is different from the job you do. They practically reduced the role of the executive producer on a film to a figurehead. Although Marshall had actually been on the set for most of the shooting schedule, at least eight out of 12 days, the Hollywood lawyers downplayed his presence and told Levin that their client had only been on the set three or four times. She learned that Spielberg had merely asked Frank Marshall to help him.

In return, Levin mentioned that Cal/OSHA had decided to “hold back” on prosecuting its civil citations until the DA made the decision regarding criminal action. Levin also advised Pollock that she had talked to people from the district attorney’s office and that in these conversations she heard no mention at all of any criminal charges being considered against Marshall. By the second month following the Twilight Zone crash, the district attorney’s office became actively involved. On September 9 the DA’s office performed the official filing. Initially, the DA handled the case like any other. The filing came within days after the DA Gary Kesselman first viewed the accident footage where the chem machine’s frozen frame showed the powerful fireball erupting from “the fourth hut.” At the time the chief DA was Democrat John Van de Kamp, soon to become the state’s top cop. Van de Kamp ran the largest DA’s office in the country. Numbering over 700 full-time attorneys, with central operations in downtown LA, his office operated 23 branches throughout the monster sprawl of LA County. Newhall, which included the Indian Dunes area, technically fell under the jurisdiction of the local DA’s branch manned by a single individual, Joel Hoffman. Hoffman’s chief downtown was a tall, crusty, slow-speaking veteran prosecutor known as “Indian” Billy Webb. Webb’s office, which supervised the outlying areas like Newhall, was called the Branch and Area Division. With the DA becoming active, homicide man Tom Budds at the sheriff ’s department at last could be expected to get a little help; so far, it’d been pretty much just him and Finnigan during the entire month of August. The same went for Joel Hoffman at Newhall. During the first month he was pretty much on his own. He simply oversaw the case until “Indian” Billy Webb made a decision as to which of the 700 attorneys he would pick to handle this unusual movie case. Webb knew what kind of person he didn’t want. His choice couldn’t be any one of the lawyers who had acted as technical advisers on Hollywood movies – in the world’s movie capital that consideration actually eliminated a good many in the DA’s office. The prosecutor had to be resistant to Hollywood. “I wouldn’t say you could become corrupted,” Webb noted, “but you could be awed by it.” Finally, his choice depended on a person’s willingness", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634243667_cleaned.txt:199:4efcda06d71b", "wtk_id": NaN}]
